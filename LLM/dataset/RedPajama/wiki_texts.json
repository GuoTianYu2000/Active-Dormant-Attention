These screwworms are referred to as \"secondary\" because they typically infest wounds after invasion by primary myiasis-causing flies. While blow flies may be found in every terrestrial habitat, C. macellaria is primarily found in the United States, American tropics, and sometimes southern Canada. They are most common in the southeastern United States in states like Florida. C. macellaria have a metallic greenish-blue thorax and a red-orange head and eyes. These adult blowflies range from 5\u20138\u00a0mm in size. \n\nSince the fly larvae infect the wounds and dead tissue of animals, these flies pose a grave medical and economic risk to humans and livestock. C. macellaria are attracted to carrion and garbage and are often found in slaughterhouses and outdoor markets in the tropics. While these flies carry many various types of Salmonella and viruses like the swine influenza, C. macellaria can also serve as important decomposers in our ecosystem.\n\nDescription\nCochliomyia macellaria are classified as intermediate sized flies with a dull or bright metallic, blue-green coloration. On their thorax, there are three black longitudinal stripes that interrupt the blue-green color. The eye and head of these flies are orange-red in color. C. macellaria also has pale setae on the fronto-orbital plate outside of the frontal bristles. On C. macellaria the frontal row of bristles extend anteriorly to the base of the first antennal segment and consist of 12-14 bristles. The legs of the fly are orange brown to dark brown, and the coxae are orange brown to black with a green metallic luster. C. macellaria possess a dark reddish brown anterior femur and an orange-red anterior tibia. The anterior tibia also has four short bristles that are placed on the dorsal side. The color of the wings of the fly is orange brown tint towards the base. On these wings, the veins in the fly are orange brown to dark brown. The costal sessions 2 to 6 are in the proportions 78:56:96:30:6:6. The first genital section is black with a metallic green luster. On the fly, the scattered setae and a defined marginal row of bristles; the second segment is smaller with a dark brown to black tint with scattered setae.\n\nDistinguishing features\nCochliomyia macellaria is closely related to C. hominivorax but can be distinguished from C. hominivorax in three primarily ways: two of which are seen in adults and one which is seen in the larvae. In adults, the hairs on the fronto-orbital plate are black in C. hominivorax, but are pale in C. macellaria. Additionally, the central black stripe on the thorax extends only slightly in front of the mesonotal suture in C. hominivorax and well in front of the suture in C. macellaria. C. macellaria larvae, unlike like C. hominivorax larvae, do not have pigmented tracheal trunks but instead have V-shaped spines on the anal protuberance. C. macellaria also does not have an oral sclerite.\n\nDistribution and territory\nCochliomyia macellaria is most often found in the southeastern part of the United States, in states like Florida, Louisiana, and Georgia. Despite the high concentration in these states, these flies have been found as far north as Southern Canada and as south as the Neotropics, with the exclusion of countries like Chile and Argentina. While they have been found in this large expanse of areas, they have been shown to thrive most in warm and humid areas like the Southern United States, Caribbean Islands, Central America, and northern South America. In these areas, the population size typically increases during periods of extended rainfall.\n\nThe territories of these blowflies are relatively small, especially during the time of mating. In this period, these flies will stay within a couple meters of one another.\n\nLife cycle and history\n\nThe average life span of an adult C. macellaria is 2\u20136 weeks. In this time period, the females try to increase the chances of producing as many surviving offspring as possible. In a lifetime, C. macellaria may lay up to 1000 or more eggs. These eggs are typically laid in groups of 40 to 250. Females may also lay their eggs with other females, leading to an accumulation of thousands of eggs.\n\nEggs\nThe eggs of C. macellaria are laid in large groups (40\u2013250 eggs at one time) and typically hatch in about 24 hours. The time taken for eggs to hatch often depends on moisture, temperature, and precipitation. In favorable conditions, the eggs may hatch in just four hours. These eggs are about 1\u00a0mm long and appear white to pearl white in color.\n\nLarvae\nThe larval stage of C. macellaria is referred to by the common name of secondary screwworms; this is due to the presence of small spines on each body segment that resemble parts of a screw. The larval stage of C. macellaria immediately follows the egg stage and is typically broken down into three substages or instars. Upon hatching, the larve appear a cream color, have cylindrical bodies with 10 or more spines around the spiracular area, possess incomplete peritremes (an indistinct or absent button), and have bands of small spines on each segment. C. macellaria, unlike like C. hominivorax, do not have pigmented tracheal trunks; instead, they have V-shaped spines on the anal protuberance. C. macellaria also does not have an oral sclerite.\n\nCochliomyia macellaria larvae will feed on the decaying flesh of the animal that they have been laid on until they reach maturity. This stage of maturity is during the third instar and by this time point, the larvae may be as long as 17\u00a0mm. The entire larval stage is about four to seven days long, and afterwards, the larvae fall off the food source to pupate in the top layer of the soil.\n\nPupae\nThe C. macellaria larvae will typically burrow underneath the top layer of soil, leaves, garbage and begin to pupate there. During this stage, the outer layer begins to turn brown from the cream white that it used to be. The outer skin will begin to shrink and harden while the pupa develops entirely in the hardened shell. Based on the temperature, the length of this stage will vary greatly. In warmer temperatures, the stage may last as short as seven days, but in colder temperatures, it may last as long as two months.\n\nAdults\nAdult C. macellaria are considered to be medium-sized flies because they are about 6 to 9\u00a0mm in size and appear bright metallic blue-green to blueish purple in color. These adults typically spend one to two days maturing after leaving the pupae stage. Within four days of emerging from the pupa stage, the adult C. macellaria become sexually mature and start looking for mates. The males will typically mate rapidly and will spend most of their time eating nearby vegetation and nectar from flowers. The females, on the other hand, will feed on the fluids of live wounds from animals. Contrary to the males, the females will travel long distances to find mates.\n\nFood resources\n\nDepending on the gender and stage in their development, C. macellaria will utilize different resources for energy and nutrients. During the larval stage, the C. macellaria will dig deeper into the necrotic wounds of their host animal and feed on the dead tissue. Both males and females will feast through this method. This time period is extremely crucial to the flies, as they must gather enough nutrients in order to last through the pupal stage without any food sources. This is one reason why the larvae are much larger than the size of the adult C. macellaria.\n\nAs adults, the food specifications of the flies change. Female flies will continue to feed on tissues of animals; however, now they preferentially feed off of live tissue and tissue plasma. Males, at this point, will no longer consume tissue, but instead will eat nearby vegetation and intake nutrients from the nectar of flowers.\n\nMating\nAlthough there are few studies on the mating patterns of C. macellaria, there is some information on the interactions between the males and females. Adult female C. macellaria have been observed to will release pheromones that will stimulate the males copulatory attempts on contact. Even though depriving the C. macellaria adults of dietary proteins did not impact the potency of the female extracts, there was a reduced response in males for the pheromones.\n\nParental care\n\nMale C. macellaria do not provide parental care. The males will typically mate quickly and have the females bear the young. Since the females lay so many eggs, there is little care provided by the actual mothers after laying the eggs. The females do strategically lay the eggs in dead skin flesh so that once the eggs hatch into larvae, nutrition will be readily available.\n\nSocial behavior\nTraditional social behavior like lekking has not been observed in C. macellaria; however, other social behaviors have been observed.\n\nEgg laying\n\nIt is common for female C. macellaria to lay eggs with other females. Since females may lay up to 250 eggs, it is common for aggregations of thousands of eggs to infest entire animal carcasses.\n\nPheromone selectivity\nWhile C. hominivorax is closely related to C. macellaria, there are evolutionary developed methods that lead to reproductive isolation. One of these mechanisms is the interspecies response to the C. macellaria female pheromone. Studies on newly colonized C. hoinivorax males have demonstrated that the males do not response to the C. macellaria pheromone.\n\nEnemies\n\nLarval predation\nWhen studying the larval dispersal and predation for C. macellaria, studies have shown that there is interspecies competition and predation. It has been demonstrated that C. albiceps larvae attack C. macellaria larvae during their dispersal process. Additionally, C. macellaria showed higher aggregation level in single than in double species. This may be explained by an evolutionary mechanism used to conserve and protect C. macellaria from predation.\n\nHuman depredation\nDue to the medical and economic impact of the C. macellaria and other blowflies, an array of pesticides have been developed to reduce the C. macellaria population, including pyrethrin aerosol.\n\nMimicry and protective coloration\n\nWhile there are theories for protective coloration, there is no clear mimicry done by C. macellaria or by other insects specifically mimicking C. macellaria. The metallic green coloration may be a form of warding off predators, but this still in the process of being analyzed.\n\nImpact\n\nMedical\nCochliomyia macellaria has extensive medical and economic implications. When C. macellaria larvae infest the dead and decaying tissues of animals or humans, myiasis may often occur. Once infestation occurs, a dark brown discharge will start to leaking from the wound. As the infestation increases, there is more agitation and inflamed tissue, which is accompanied by unpleasant smells. After the process of clinical diagnosis begins and the myiasis is recognized, then the larvae are easier to identify. Treatment of these infestations can be time intensive and leads to increased chances of reoccurrences. The first step is manual removal of the larvae followed by an antibiotic smear.\n\nEconomic\nThe livestock industry considers the secondary screwworm an important pest because of the enormous economic losses caused by cases of myiasis and disease transmission. The medical and pesticide treatment costs the United States millions of dollars annually.\n\nForensic importance\n\nCochliomyia macellaria is the most common species of blow flies found on carrion in the southern United States.  C. macellaria has recently gained recognition in forensic entomology because of its occurrence on decomposing remains.  Since the analysis of the succession and occurrence has been well defined, it is possible to create postmortem interval estimations, which are crucial for forensic entomology. Adult C. macellaria in the southeastern United States are only attracted to the dead tissue on animals minutes after the death. In other regions of the United States, the adult flies are attracted to the dead flesh after a 24-hour delay.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCalliphoridae\nArticles created by Qbugbot\nInsects described in 1775\nTaxa named by Johan Christian Fabricius\nDiptera of North America\nInsects of the United States", "Coleophora setipalpella \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie de mariposa do g\u00eanero Coleophora pertencente \u00e0 fam\u00edlia Coleophoridae.\n\nBibliografia \n Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS) (2008): Australian Faunal Directory \u2014 Coleophoridae.\n Pitkin, Brian & Jenkins, Paul (2004): Butterflies and Moths of the World, Generic Names and their Type-species \u2014 Coleophora.\n Savela, Markku (2010): Markku Savela's Lepidoptera and some other life forms \u2014 Coleophoridae.\n Tree of Life Web Project (ToL) (2009): Coleophoridae.\n\nLiga\u00e7\u00f5es externas \n Natural History Museum Coleophoridae\n\nColeophora", "Behrouz Rahbar (, 23 September 1945 \u2013 22 March 2019) was an Iranian cyclist.

Flooding associated with meltwater is a significant hazard in some volcanic areas, including Iceland, Alaska, and parts of the Andes. J\u00f6kulhlaups (glacial outburst floods) have been identified as the most frequently occurring volcanic hazard in Iceland, with major events where peak discharges of meltwater can reach 10,000 \u2013 100,000\u00a0m3/s occurring when there are large eruptions beneath glaciers.\n\nIt is important to explore volcano-ice interactions to improve the effectiveness of monitoring these events and to undertake hazard assessments. This is particularly relevant given that subglacial eruptions have demonstrated their ability to cause widespread impact, with the ash cloud associated with Iceland's Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption in 2010 resulting in significant impacts to aviation across Europe.\n\nExamples\n\nDeception Island, Antarctica (1969)\nGiven that subglacial eruptions occur in often sparsely populated regions, they are not commonly observed or monitored; thus timings and sequences of events for an eruption of this type are poorly constrained.\nResearch of the 1969 Deception Island eruption demonstrates that the impact of a subglacial eruption is not limited purely by glacier thickness, but that the pre-volcanic ice structure and densification (proportion of impermeable ice) play a role as well. In this case, even though the glacier was thin, a large j\u00f6kulhlaup was observed as the glacier was largely made up of impermeable (unfractured) ice with a sudden supraglacial flood once the cavity has reached capacity. The resulting flood severely damaged buildings on the island, with complete destruction of a British scientific station.\n\nGr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn, Iceland (1996)\nOver a period of 13 days in 1996, 3\u00a0km2 of ice was melted with erupted magma fracturing into glass to form a 7\u00a0km long and 300\u00a0m high hyaloclastite ridge under 750\u00a0m of ice at Gjalp fissure vent of Gr\u00edmsv\u00f6tn volcano in Iceland. Meltwater flowed along a narrow basal glacier bed into a subglacial lake for five weeks, before being released as a sudden flood, or j\u00f6kulhlaup. Although it has been proposed that subglacial volcanism may play a role in the dynamics of West Antarctic ice streams by supplying water to their base, for the Gjalp eruption, no rapid basal sliding was observed at the regional scale, with the formation of ice cauldrons over eruptive fissures due to the sudden removal of mass at the base.\n\nResearch demonstrated that for warm-based glaciers, the effects of subglacial volcanic eruptions are localised, with eruptions forming deep depressions and causing j\u00f6kulhlaups. For there to be significant changes in the extent and shape of an ice sheet, extensive subglacial volcanism would be required, melting a considerable fraction of the total ice volume over a short period of time.\n\nEyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, Iceland (2010)\n\nIn the first two days of the eruption, ice cauldrons were formed over the volcanic vents. Radar images reveal the development of these cauldrons in a 200\u00a0m thick ice cover within the summit caldera. They can also be used to document the subglacial and supraglacial passage of meltwater away from the eruption site. Research shows the eruption breached the ice surface four hours after the initial eruption onset, whilst meltwater release was characterised by accumulation and subsequent drainage, with most of the volcanic material in the ice cauldrons being drained in hyperconcentrated floods.\n\nSee also\n Pillow lava\n Subaqueous volcano\n Subglacial mound\n Subglacial volcano\n Submarine volcano\n Tuya\n Types of volcanic eruptions\n\nReferences\n\nPhreatomagmatic eruptions\nGlaciovolcanism\nVolcanic eruption types", "Habrophlebia is a genus of pronggilled mayflies in the family Leptophlebiidae.

Data can include object Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, weather station telemetry, text messages, announcements, queries, and other telemetry. APRS data can be displayed on a map, which can show stations, objects, tracks of moving objects, weather stations, search and rescue data, and direction finding data.\n\nAPRS data is typically transmitted on a single shared frequency (depending on country) to be repeated locally by area relay stations (digipeaters) for widespread local consumption. In addition, all such data are typically ingested into the APRS Internet System (APRS-IS) via an Internet-connected receiver (IGate) and distributed globally for ubiquitous and immediate access.  Data shared via radio or Internet are collected by all users and can be combined with external map data to build a shared live view.\n\nAPRS was developed from the late 1980s forward by Bob Bruninga, call sign WB4APR, a senior research engineer at the United States Naval Academy. He maintained the main APRS Web site until his death in 2022. The initialism \"APRS\" was derived from his call sign.\n\n\n\nHistory\nBob Bruninga, a senior research engineer at the United States Naval Academy, implemented the earliest ancestor of APRS on an Apple II computer in 1982. This early version was used to map high frequency Navy position reports. The first use of APRS was in 1984, when Bruninga developed a more advanced version on a VIC-20 for reporting the position and status of horses in a  endurance run.\n\nDuring the next two years, Bruninga continued to develop the system, which he then called the Connectionless Emergency Traffic System (CETS). Following a series of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) exercises using CETS, the system was ported to the IBM Personal Computer. During the early 1990s, CETS (then known as the Automatic Position Reporting System) continued to evolve into its current form.\n\nAs GPS technology became more widely available, \"Position\" was replaced with \"Packet\" to better describe the more generic capabilities of the system and to emphasize its uses beyond mere position reporting.\n\nBruninga has also stated that APRS was not meant to be a vehicle position tracking system, and can be interpreted rather as \u201cAutomatic Presence Reporting System\u201d.\n\nNetwork overview\nAPRS (Automatic Packet Reporting System), is a digital communications protocol for exchanging information among a large number of stations covering a large (local) area, often referred to as \"IP-ers\". As a multi-user data network, it is quite different from conventional packet radio. Rather than using connected data streams where stations connect to each other and packets are acknowledged and retransmitted if lost, APRS operates entirely in an unconnected broadcast fashion, using unnumbered AX.25 frames.\n\nAPRS packets are transmitted for all other stations to hear and use. Packet repeaters, called digipeaters, form the backbone of the APRS system, and use store and forward technology to retransmit packets. All stations operate on the same radio channel, and packets move through the network from digipeater to digipeater, propagating outward from their point of origin. All stations within radio range of each digipeater receive the packet. At each digipeater, the packet path is changed. The packet will be repeated through only a certain number of digipeaters\u00a0\u2014 or hops\u00a0\u2014 depending upon the all-important \"PATH\" setting.\n\nDigipeaters keep track of the packets they forward for a period of time, thus preventing duplicate packets from being retransmitted. This keeps packets from circulating in endless loops inside the ad hoc network. Eventually, most packets are heard by an APRS Internet Gateway, called an IGate, and the packets are routed on to the Internet APRS backbone (where duplicate packets heard by other IGates are discarded) for display or analysis by other users connected to an APRS-IS server, or on a Web site designed for the purpose.\n\nWhile it would seem that using unconnected and unnumbered packets without acknowledgment and retransmission on a shared and sometimes congested channel would result in poor reliability due to a packet being lost, this is not the case, because the packets are transmitted (broadcast) to everyone and multiplied many times over by each digipeater. This means that all digipeaters and stations in range get a copy, and then proceed to broadcast it to all other digipeaters and stations within their range. The result is that packets are multiplied more than they are lost. Therefore, packets can sometimes be heard some distance from the originating station. Packets can be digitally repeated tens of kilometers or even hundreds of kilometers, depending on the height and range of the digipeaters in the area.\n\nWhen a packet is transmitted, it is duplicated many times as it radiates out, taking all available paths simultaneously, until the number of \"hops\" allowed by the path setting is consumed.\n\nPositions/objects/items\n\nAPRS contains a number of packet types, including position/object/item, status, messages, queries, weather reports and telemetry. The position/object/item packets contain the latitude and longitude, and a symbol to be displayed on the map, and have many optional fields for altitude, course, speed, radiated power, antenna height above average terrain, antenna gain, and voice operating frequency. Positions of fixed stations are configured in the APRS software. Moving stations (portable or mobile) automatically derive their position information from a GPS receiver connected to the APRS equipment.\n\nThe map display uses these fields to plot communication range of all participants and facilitate the ability to contact users during both routine and emergency situations. Each position/object/item packet can use any of several hundred different symbols. Position/objects/items can also contain weather information or can be any number of dozens of standardised weather symbols. Each symbol on an APRS map can display many attributes, discriminated either by colour or other technique. These attributes are:\n\n Moving or fixed\n Dead-reckoned or old\n Message capable or not\n Station, object or item\n Own object or other station object/item\n Emergency, priority, or special\n\nStatus/messages\nThe Status packet is free-field format that lets each station announce its current mission or application or contact information or any other information or data of immediate use to surrounding activities. The message packet can be used for point-to-point messages, bulletins, announcements or even email. Bulletins and Announcements are treated specially and displayed on a single \"community Bulletin board\". This community bulletin board is fixed size and all bulletins from all posters are sorted onto this display. The intent of this display is to be consistent and identical for all viewers so that all participants are seeing the same information at the same time. Since lines are sorted onto the display, then individual posters can edit, update, or delete individual lines of their bulletins at any time to keep the bulletin board up-to-date to all viewers.\n\nAll APRS messages are delivered live in real-time to online recipients. Messages are not stored and forwarded, but retried until timed out. The delivery of these messages is global, since the APRS-IS distributes all packets to all other IGates in the world and those that are messages will actually go back to RF via any IGate that is near the intended recipient.\n\nE-mail \nA special case message can be sent to EMAIL where these messages are pulled off the real-time APRS-IS and wrapped into a standard Email and forwarded into regular Internet email. Until 2019 this was done by the WU2Z Email engine, this is replaced by the javAPRSSrvr Email Gateway.\n\nCapabilities\nIn its simplest implementation, APRS is used to transmit real-time data, information and reports of the exact location of a person or object via a data signal sent over amateur radio frequencies. In addition to real-time position reporting capabilities using attached GPS receivers, APRS is also capable of transmitting a wide variety of data, including weather reports, short text messages, radio direction finding bearings, telemetry data, short e-mail messages (send only) and storm forecasts. Once transmitted, these reports can be combined with a computer and mapping software to show the transmitted data superimposed with great precision upon a map display.\n\nWhile the map plotting is the most visible feature of APRS, the text messaging capabilities and local information distribution capabilities, combined with the robust network, should not be overlooked; the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management has an extensive network of APRS stations to allow text messaging between all of the county Emergency Operating Centers in the event of the failure of conventional communications.\n\nTechnical information\n\nIn its most widely used form, APRS is transported over the AX.25 protocol using 1,200-bit/s Bell 202 AFSK on frequencies located within the 2-meter amateur band.\n\nSample APRS VHF frequencies\n 144.39\u00a0MHz\u00a0: North America, Colombia, Chile, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand\n 144.575\u00a0MHz\u00a0: New Zealand\n 144.64\u00a0MHz\u00a0: Taiwan\n 144.66\u00a0MHz\u00a0: Japan\n 144.8\u00a0MHz\u00a0: South Africa, Europe, Russia\n 144.93\u00a0MHz\u00a0: Argentina, Uruguay, Panama\n 145.175\u00a0MHz\u00a0: Australia\n 145.57\u00a0MHz\u00a0: Brazil\n 145.825\u00a0MHz\u00a0: International Space Station\n 430.5125\u00a0MHz\u00a0: Netherlands (UHF) (Phased out due to transition to 432.5\u00a0MHz.)\n 432.5\u00a0MHz \u00a0: Europe (UHF)\n\nAn extensive digital repeater, or \"digipeater,\" network provides transport for APRS packets on these frequencies. Internet gateway stations (IGates) connect the on-air APRS network to the APRS Internet System (APRS-IS), which serves as a worldwide, high-bandwidth backbone for APRS data. Stations can tap into this stream directly, and a number of databases connected to the APRS-IS allow Web-based access to the data as well as more advanced data-mining capabilities. A number of low-Earth orbiting satellites, including the International Space Station, are capable of relaying APRS data.\n\nEquipment settings\nAn APRS infrastructure comprises a variety of Terminal Node Controller (TNC) equipment put in place by individual amateur radio operators. This includes sound cards interfacing a radio to a computer, simple TNCs, and \"smart\" TNCs. The \"smart\" TNCs are capable of determining what has already happened with the packet and can prevent redundant packet repeating within the network.\n\nReporting stations use a method of routing called a \"path\" to broadcast the information through a network. In a typical packet network, a station would use a path of known stations such as \"via n8xxx,n8ary.\"  This causes the packet to be repeated through the two stations before it stops. In APRS, generic call signs are assigned to repeater stations to allow a more automatic operation.\n\nRecommended path\nThroughout North America (and in many other regions) the recommended path for mobiles or portable stations is now WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1. Fixed Stations (homes, etc.) should not normally use a path routing if they do not need to be digitally repeated outside of their local area, otherwise a path of WIDE2-2 or less should be used as requirements dictate. The path parameter reflects the routing of packets via the radio component of APRS, and fixed stations should carefully consider their choice of path routing. Any path selection for stations that do not require it contributes to congestion of the APRS frequency and may hinder other stations' reporting. Aircraft and balloon APRS stations should avoid beaconing with any path at altitude since digipeating may not be necessary due to their antenna height and likelihood of reaching multiple wide-ranging digipeaters and IGates. Mobile stations in congested areas or more populated areas may consider using only 1 hop (WIDE1-1), as there are usually enough Internet gateways nearby that no path routing is needed. One solution to the path selection is proportional pathing if the user's equipment is capable.\n\nOld path\nEarly on, the widely accepted method of configuring stations was to enable the short-range stations to repeat packets requesting a path of \"RELAY\" and long-range stations were configured to repeat both \"RELAY\" and \"WIDE\" packets. This was accomplished by setting the station's MYALIAS setting to RELAY or WIDE as needed. This resulted in a path of RELAY,WIDE for reporting stations. However, there was no duplicate packet checking or alias substitution. This sometimes caused beacons to \"ping pong\" back and forth instead of propagating outwards from the source. This caused much interference. With no alias substitution, one could not tell which digipeaters a beacon had used.\n\nNew path\nWith the advent of the new \"smart\" TNCs, the stations that used to be \"WIDE\" became \"WIDEn-N.\" This means a packet with a path of WIDE2-2 would be repeated through the first station as WIDE2-2, but the path will be modified (decremented) to WIDE2-1 for the next station to repeat. The packet stops being repeated when the \"-N\" portion of the path reaches \"-0.\" This new protocol has caused the old RELAY and WIDE paths to become obsolete. Digi operators are being asked to re-configure fill-in \"RELAY\" stations to instead respond to WIDE1-1. This results in a new, more efficient path of WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1.\n\nRelated systems\nThe APRS protocol has been adapted and extended to support projects not directly related to its original purpose. The most notable of these are the FireNet and PropNET projects.\n\n APRS FireNet is an Internet-based system using the APRS protocol and much of the same client software to provide fire fighting, earthquake, and weather information in much higher volume and detail than the traditional APRS system is capable of carrying.\n PropNET uses the APRS protocol over AX.25 and PSK31 to study radio frequency propagation. PropNET \"probes\" transmit position reports, along with information on transmitter power, elevation, and antenna gain, at various frequencies to allow monitoring stations to detect changes in propagation conditions. It is based on ACDS, a special client program running under Microsoft Windows.\n\nSee also\n APRS Calling\n Automatic identification system\u2014position reporting system used for marine traffic\n Spartan Packet Radio Experiment\u2014an experiment intended to test the tracking of satellites via amateur packet radio, flown on Space Shuttle mission STS-72.\n Traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS)\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n www.aprs.org\u00a0\u2014 Automatic Packet Reporting System site\n \n findU is a database archiving weather, position, telemetry, and message data.\n aprs.fi\u00a0\u2014 Google Map-based tracking/mapping\n www.pinpointaprs.com\u00a0\u2014 A free Windows based desktop APRS client with built-in mapping.\nNRAPRS Pro  Beta APRS system / server for Network Radio users\nDire Wolf is a free open source software replacement for the 1980s technology TNC.\n\nPacket radio", "Victor Zagainov (May 31, 1953 \u2013 October 5, 2002) was a hot air balloon pilot and astronomer from Kazakhstan. He was the first and only hot air balloon champion of the USSR (1991), Hot Air Balloon champion of the Republic of Kazakhstan (1993), the winner of the International Balloon Grand Prix Todi (Italy) (1993), the champion of the CIS (1996). He organized Grand Prix of Zagainov and was awarded F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale (FAI) Diploma for Outstanding Airmanship (Award ID# 5349) and the FAI Air Sport Medal (Award ID# 5244) in 2003.\n\nEarly years \n\nVictor Zagainov was born in the family of a military pilot Alexander Zagainov  in Tsulukidze (now Khoni) of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, where at that time the military unit of his father was based. His father retired in Lugansk (former Voroshilovgrad), Ukraine where Victor grew up. From his early years, Victor had two passions, both related to the sky - he wanted to fly like his father, and he was in love with the stars. However due to partial colour blindness Victor was not accepted to the flight school. Therefore stars became his main obsession and future profession.\n\nFrom the 7th grade, he spent much time in Lugansk Pedagogical Institute, where there was a small telescope. He did many observations and read a lot. He was a winner of the Republican Astronomy Olympiad in grade 9th and 10th. He graduated school in Lugansk and entered Odessa University in 1971 with Astronomy major.\n\nAfter graduation he worked as an astronomer at the limited access observatory in Uzbekistan and later in Kazakhstan near Alma-Ata (now Almaty). In 1980, Victor decided to settle in Kazakhstan.\n\nTeaching of astronomy \n\nFor several years (1983-1990) Mr. Zagainov led a club of amateur astronomers at the National Palace of Pioneers of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Among his students are well-known physicists, mathematicians, journalists working in Almaty, Russia and abroad. Many of them repeatedly flew with Victor on his legendary balloon \"Altair\". For many of them he was not only a teacher but also a father. His heart and home were always open to them. Even after 13 years of not running the club they came to him for advice.\n\nHot air ballooning \n\nIn 1989, Victor was first introduced to ballooning - long cherished dream of a flight in the sky. In 1990 he had built his first hot air balloon. The envelope was made in Feodosiya, the burner was done by well-known designer D. Bimbat in Sverdlovsk and the basket he weaved himself. The name and design of the balloon reflected his two passions (astronomy and flights). A proudly soaring eagle and the inscription \"Altair\" (which in Arabic means \"The flying eagle\") - the name of Alpha Aquilae.\n\nThe first inflation of \"Altair\" happened in December 1990 in Sverdlovsk. In February 1991 he flew this balloon in Norway. Then in August it was in Ukraine. In September 1991 Victor Zagainov on the Hot Air Balloon \"Altair\" become the first champion of the USSR. In the same year the Soviet Union collapsed, so Victor Zagainov was the only one to receive this title. His astronomy club students were not only his first passengers, but also members of his crew. Three out of the four members of his crew at the National Championship of USSR in 1991 were his former students.\n\nGrand Prix of Zagainov \n\nVictor was one of the biggest promoters of Hot Air Ballooning. As part of this work in his new home country Kazakhstan he organized Hot Air Balloon competition - Grand Prix of Zagainov. For the first time it took place in 1992. Such event offered opportunity for novice pilots to improve their skills, while introducing international standards to them. To help Kazakh pilots improve their level, Victor invited pilots from Pakistan, France, Switzerland, England, Scotland, Germany, United States, Ukraine and Russia. Main goal of Grand Prix of Zagainov was to rise new generation of pilots.\n\nAs part of Grand Prix of Zagainov in 1996 Victor organized national records setting flight for Hot Air Balloons of different classes. This was a first time any Hot Air Balloon record registration request was submitted to FAI.\n\nOther events and competitions\n\nFinal flight \n\nOn October 3, 2002, taking part in a ballooning event in the town of Zheleznovodsk (Russia), Victor Zagainov's balloon was involved in a mid-air collision between his balloon's envelope and a descending balloon's basket. Victor's envelope was torn open at a height of 300 m, initiating a very fast and uncontrolled descent. Despite his best efforts to keep the balloon inflated with continuous heating, the envelope caught fire, deflated and the balloon plunged to the ground.\n\nOn board with Victor, as the only passenger, was his best friend's and crew-member's 19-year-old daughter. Realizing that he could not stop or slow the balloon's descent, just before impact Victor lifted the girl in his arms and placed himself underneath her, thus acting as a living cushion on impact. Both occupants survived the crash and the girl was released from hospital after a routine check, with just a few scratches and concussion. Victor Zagainov succumbed to severe internal injuries two days later.\n\nReferences \n\n1953 births\n2002 deaths\nSoviet balloonists\nKazakhstani balloonists\nHot Air Ballooning in Kazakhstan\nSoviet astronomers", "The 2001 Seattle Seahawks season was the franchise's 26th season in the National Football League (NFL), The second of two seasons the Seahawks played at Husky Stadium while Qwest Field was being built and the third under head coach Mike Holmgren. They improved on their 6\u201310 record from 2000 and finished the season at 9\u20137. The Seahawks were in the playoff hunt until the last game of the season; the Baltimore Ravens' win over the Minnesota Vikings on the last Monday Night game of the year ended Seattle's post-season bid. The 2001 season was the final season for the Seahawks in the American Football Conference (AFC) and the second and final season they played at Husky Stadium while Seahawks Stadium (now known as Lumen Field) was being built.\n\nBefore the season, the Seahawks signed free agent quarterback Trent Dilfer, and traded for quarterback Matt Hasselbeck. Hasselbeck eventually won the starting position over Dilfer. The Seahawks also signed future Hall of Fame defensive tackle John Randle, who spent the last 11 seasons with the Minnesota Vikings and would make the Pro Bowl in his first season with the Seahawks.\n\nThe season saw the emergence of the second year running back Shaun Alexander after Ricky Watters was injured for most of the season.

After securing the rights to creating a British version of American original, the BBC commissioned a total of twelve episodes, a standard that would be used for consecutive series. It is the only series not to feature a boardroom scene after a candidate quit the programme following a task. Alongside the twelve episodes that were produced, two specials were also created and aired alongside this series \u2013 \"The Story so Far\" on 2 April, aimed at bringing viewers up to speed on the series; and \"You're Hired!\" on 7 May, aired after the series finale, with a format that would be later adapted for use in The Apprentice: You're Fired when it began the following year.\n\nFourteen candidates took part in this programme's first series, with Tim Campbell becoming the overall winner of the series. Excluding specials, the series averaged roughly around 2.5\u00a0million viewers during its broadcast.\n\nSeries overview \nWork on the series began in Autumn 2004, after the BBC successfully secured the rights to creating a British version of the American original, followed by the broadcaster receiving an agreement of acceptance from Alan Sugar to be at the head of the new programme. Involved in development of the format, Sugar worked with the production staff to determine what tasks would be faced by those participating in the series, and how he would be given feedback on these. Amongst the discussions undertaken with him, it was decided that two of Sugar's close business associates, Nick Hewer and Margaret Mountford, would star alongside him in the role of his aides, and that one of the tasks would focus on interviewing candidates who reached the penultimate stage of the process, with both Hewer and Mountford overseeing this, alongside other business associates of Sugar \u2013 Paul Kemsley, Claude Littner, and Bordan Tkachuk.\n\nApplicants for the show were whittled down by the production staff and researchers until around fourteen candidates, consisting of a balanced mix of male and female participants, were chosen to appear in the series. As part of their first task, the candidates formed teams consisting of their respective genders \u2013 the women named their team First Forte, while the men named their team Impact. This series is unique for being the only series to date in the show's history, not to feature an extensive boardroom scene after a candidate chose to leave the programme following the fourth task, and to feature a charity-based challenge with no proper reward for the winning team. In addition, the Final of the series only allowed six \"fired\" candidates to return and provide assistance to the series' two finalists. The schedule for episodes was fixed towards Wednesday evenings, after the watershed period, as final edits of episodes maintained a level of content that included swearing more suitable for mature viewers than young family audiences.\n\nOf those who took part, Tim Campbell would become the eventual winner of the series, and go on to become Project Director of Amstrad's new Health and Beauty division at the time, with his time there documented in a special episode prior to the second series, entitled \"Tim in the Firing Line\". In 2006, Campbell would leave the company to pursue other interests, and would go on to found the Bright Ideas Trust in 2008, offering funding and support for young people wishing to start their own

Total premium income for 2018/19 was US$402 million. In addition to Oslo, Skuld has offices in Bergen, Bermuda, Copenhagen, Hamburg, Hong Kong, London, New York, Piraeus, Singapore and Tokyo.\n\nHistory \nSkuld was established in 1897 in Oslo, Norway, as the first P&I Club outside the United Kingdom. The name has its origins in Norse mythology, according to which Skuld is one of the powerful goddesses known as norns who weave the threads of destiny. The purpose of the association is \"mutual insurance against liabilities and losses incurred by members in direct connection with the operation of the entered vessels\".\n\nPresent status \nAs a mutual association, the club has no shareholders and is owned and controlled directly by its insured shipowners, who are known as members of the club and are entitled to vote at the general meeting according to the gross tonnage of the ships entered in the association.  The members elect a committee of between 12 and 30 members which meets twice a year, and a board of directors consisting of between five and nine members.  The conditions of membership and terms of insurance are contained in the statutes and rules.\n\nSkuld underwent a major restructuring in the period 2000 to 2003 which led to a substantial improvement in its financial strength and Standard & Poor's rating of A with a stable outlook. It also led to diversification into other marine insurance, including non-mutual. The annual report for the insurance year ending 20 February 2019 records assets of more than US$1 billion and a contingency reserve of $453 million. At the commencement the 2019/2020 insurance year, the entered tonnage for liability insurance reached 103 million gross tons. Some 22% of the tonnage entered continues to be Scandinavian-controlled. Skuld is also a leading provider of charterers' liability insurance.\n\nSkuld is one of thirteen members of the International Group of P&I Clubs that work closely together in reinsurance and industry matters of common interest. The P&I Clubs in the International Group provide insurance for the liabilities of approximately 90% of the world's merchant fleet.\n\nIn December 2010, Skuld announced that it had also entered the Lloyd's market.\n\n1 January 2011, Skuld opened as the first P&I club, a syndicate at Lloyd's, Skuld 1897.\n\n1 January 2017, Skuld acquired Gerling Norway, a global specialist in mainly Hull Insurance \u2013 now renamed Skuld Marine Agency or SMA.\n\nIn July 2019 Skuld closed down its activities at Lloyd's London.\n\nScope of insurance \nThe P&I (\"Protection and Indemnity\") insurance provided by Skuld to its members is primarily to cover the liabilities which they incur to third parties arising out of the operation of their ships. The common types of claim which are covered are for death or injury to passengers and crew, oil pollution, cargo loss or damage, collision, wreck removal and stowaways. Shipowners' exposure to these claims has grown in line with increasing regulation of the shipping industry through International Conventions adopted by the International Maritime Organization as well as by domestic or regional legislation.\n\nSkuld has been involved in a number of high-profile cases, including the Estonia, Hebei Spirit, Braer, Sea Empress and Scandinavian Star.\n\nSkuld also provides shipowners and charterers with additional types of cover. This includes cover for legal assistance and legal costs (\"defence\" cover) as well as insurance for operators of units in the offshore and energy sector.\n\nIn Skuld Marine Agency, Skuld is offering mainly hull and machinery insurance and associated products, with a possibility to write claims lead on selected fleets.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nSkuld home page\nInternational Group of P&I Clubs\n\nP&I clubs\nCooperatives in Norway\nCompanies based in Oslo\nFinancial services companies established in 1897\nInsurance companies of Norway\nNorwegian companies established in 1897", "Events from the year 1981 in Taiwan, Republic of China.

The purpose of a collaboration tool is to support a group of two or more individuals to accomplish a common goal or objective. Collaboration tools can be either of a non-technological nature such as paper, flipcharts, post-it notes or whiteboards. They can also include software tools and applications such as collaborative software.\n\nCollaboration tools before Web 2.0 \nThe first idea to use computers in order to work with each other was formed in 1945 when Vannevar Bush shared his thoughts on a system he named\"memex\" in his article \"As We May Think\". A system that stores books, records and communications of an individual and makes them available at any time. At this stage he called it \"an enlarged supplement to his memory\".\n\nComputerized office automation \nIn 1968 computer systems were brought in connection with communication and the potential way of working together when not at the same place by Dr. J. C. R. Licklider, head of the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). In his article \u201cThe Computer as a Communication Device\u201d he envisioned the idea that there should be a way of \u201cfacilitating communication among people without bringing them together in one place\u201d , which eventually led to ARPANET, commercial time-sharing systems and finally the Internet.\n\nWhen the Microcomputer was invented in 1970, everyone learned about office automation, which led to the first collaborative software called Electronic Information Exchange System (EIES) that allowed to do surveys, threaded replies and group-structured approaches. In 1991 educator C. A. Ellis came up with the definition of the term \"groupware\" as \u201ccomputer-based systems that support groups of people engaged in a common task (or goal) and that provide an interface to a shared environment\u201d . Paul Wilson then shaped the term \u201cComputer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). He described it as \u201ca generic term which combines the understanding of the way people work in groups with the enabling technologies of computer networking, and associated hardware, software, services, and techniques\u201d.\n\nThis laid the foundation to develop further on the ideas of groupware and in the 1990s Lotus Notes, Microsoft Exchange Server and Outlook were invented. In 2002 at the Social Software Summit Clay Shirky introduced the phrase \u201csocial software\u201d as a \"software that supports group interaction\".\n\nMain types \nThree aspects of collaboration: communication, coordination and cooperation can be used to categorize collaboration tools.\n\nCommunication \nCommunication tools provide exchange of information between individuals:\n\nE-Mail\n\nThe invention of email as a collaboration tool changed the way we used to communicate in the workplace. It is the easiest method to make contact within an organization and is well established. Especially for organizing daily correspondence, email can reach various people with just one click.\n\nAlthough email is still the most common used tool in communication collaboration it is not very efficient on a big scale and other forms of communication seem to take over. Besides its flexibility it is not very good for group conversations as they grow too fast. There is no way to be sure that a person has the latest version of a document that has been sent to them and it is impossible to always track via their email what tasks need to be done and by which deadline. As Cisco states in their Cisco Blog about the \"Future of Email\", emails \"will improve productivity by organizing your data for you\"  and try to bring more transparency in their work with email.\n\nVoicemail \nVoicemail as a collaboration tool is more and more integrated in services such as Google Voice. As pointed out in an IBM future scenario the role of voicemail could be that of what email is for us today.\n\nInstant messaging (IM) \nThrough instant messaging as a collaboration tool we are able to reach people within an organisation in real-time. In the future instant messaging is not a stand-alone software anymore, but very well integrated in bigger solutions such as Unified Communication.\n\nVoIP (voice over IP) / video call \nVoice over IP as a collaboration tool has quickly gained popularity among companies and is part of their communication portfolio. As a report from Eclipse Telecom is pointing out, the VoIP is moving towards the state to totally replace our telephones in our offices and also integrate in existing collaboration service environments.\n\nCoordination \nCoordination is defined as \"the deliberate and orderly alignment or adjustment of partners\u2019 actions to achieve jointly determined goals\". Collaboration tools supporting this are the ones who allow a person to set up group activities, schedules and deliverables.\n\nOnline Calendars \nOnline calendars are part of professional behaviour at work and fully integrated in other systems. As a research paper from University of Bath explains, online calendars could in the future be much closely linked to other data such as social media and have even a larger effect.\n\nTime trackers \nTime trackers are especially used to measure the performance of employees. Its effect on productivity is discussed as being controversial.\n\nSpreadsheets \nSpreadsheets are like emails very popular within the corporate environment and as a collaboration tool essential for financial analysis or modelling. Although very popular, several studies found out that many spreadsheets contain inaccurate data and are therefore inefficient.\n\nCooperation \nCooperation tools allow groups to have real-time discussions and to shape an idea or thought together. Trends in terms of collaboration target on helping to maintain the \"main idea\" within big organizations and make connections visible. Also the idea of bringing people who are not working in a company on a regular basis into the organization and make use of their knowledge.\n\nVideo conferencing \nIn most cases video conferencing is part of the overall communication and collaboration strategy of organisations. Especially now when all services are cloud-based and therefore implementation costs became more affordable. The longterm vision for video conferencing lies in the correct usage of computer processing power, data storage or mobile bandwidth speeds to further decrease the obstacles of collaboration.\n\nIM teleconferencing \nBringing teams, meetings or events as close as possible is what teleconferencing solutions want to do. Apart from business environments Teleconferencing is currently used in a variety of fields, such as telemedicine, where they contribute enormously to the efficiency and productivity as distance and time are limited factors.\n\nClassification based on dimensions\n\nAsynchronous collaboration tools \nA collaboration tool is asynchronous when its users are collaborating at a different time:\n\nE-Mail, mailinglists and newsgroups \n\nE-Mail is the best known asynchronous collaboration tool and the most common used - it offers intuitive features for forwarding messages, creating mailing groups and attaching documents. Furthermore, information can be automatically chronologically sorted and assigned to tasks or calendar events.\n\nGroup calendar \n\nThrough group calendars meetings can be scheduled, projects managed and people coordinated. It is a great tool to help a person overlook their deliverables and deadlines. A group calendar includes functions such as the detection of conflicting schedules with other people in a team or organization or coordination of meeting times that suit everybody in a team. Besides the positive effects of group calendar there is also controversy about privacy and control that might influence a person's productivity.\n\nWorkflow systems \n\nWith workflow systems files or documents can be communicated to the organization by following a strict and organised process. They provide services for routing, development of forms and support for roles. As current workflow systems are controlled from one point, individuals within an organization normally do not have the permission to manage their own processes so far - this should be changed by implementing collaborative planning tools to current workflow systems.\n\nHypertext \n\nHypertext technology connects our files to each other and makes sure that always the latest version is available to us. When people work on different documents the system automatically updates the information of other people.\n\nSynchronous collaboration tools \n\nA collaboration tool is synchronous, when its users are collaborating at the same time:\n\nShared whiteboards \n\nShared whiteboards give its users the capability to work efficiently on a task through a web-based platform. They can be used for informal discussions and also for communications that need structure, involve drawing or are in general more sophisticated. This might also be very useful in to realise virtual classrooms.\n\nVideo communication systems \n\nVideo communication systems offer two-way or multi-way calling with a live videostream. It can be best compared to a telephone system with an additional visual element.\n\nChat systems \n\nChat systems allow people to write and send messages in real-time. They are usually structured in chat rooms which show usernames, number of people, location, discussion topic and more.\n\nDecision support systems \n\nDecision support systems support groups to manage the decision making process. They give people the ability to exchange their brainstorming, analyzing their ideas and even are used for voting. Decision making is becoming more and more a core function of modern work. According to studies 50% of organizational decisions fail.\n\nMultiplayer video games \n\nComputer games are a good example of how a multi-user situation could look like in the future. They are constantly developed and expanded with features such as chat and video systems.\n\nOnline Collaboration Tools \nOnline collaboration tools are web-based applications that offer basic services such as instant messaging for groups, mechanisms for file sharing and collaborative search engines (CSE) to find information distributed within the system of the organization, community or team. Additionally, the functionality is sometimes further expanded by providing for example integrated online calendars, shared online-whiteboards to organize tasks and ideas or internet teleconferencing integrations. The focus of online collaboration tools ranges from simple to complex, inexpensive to expensive, locally installed to remotely hosted and from commercial to open source.\n\nBackground \nNew gadgets and devices are invented every day with the goal in mind to make our daily work easier. Online collaboration tools currently try to tackle problems like these:\n\n '38% of employee time is lost duplicating work and 58% of people waste an hour a day looking for information'.\n '28 hours a week is spent on writing e-mails, searching for information and collaborating internally'.\n '59% of managers miss vital information because they cannot find it or never see it'.\n 'Six weeks per year are wasted by executives searching for lost documents'.\n\nThese aspects point out that the problem we are facing is not a technological problem - it is about people and their interactions. Although technology really helps us in this way, the key to solve these problems can be found in the way how we use these tools. Although video conferencing tools such as Skype or FaceTime connect us with everyone, they do not always give us all the contextual information. What we see might not be the reality, as there might be other people in the room that one does not know about while skyping with one's colleagues at work. More connectivity also allows more interruption: A person can work from home but is always interrupted by their neighbours or the lawnmower. This is why the future of collaboration tools looks for models that allow companies to collaborate in a focused and structured manner. One such application is the Finnish company Fingertip Ltd, which enables companies to facilitate collaboration and decision making.\n\nEvolvement\n\nFrom simple communication solutions to Unified Communications (UC) \nThe way we communicate with each other is constantly changing and disrupts our workplace environment. In 1971 programmer Ray Tomlinson sent the first message between two computers. Eight years later Usenet, a multi-network online forum, changed the way how we exchange information. With IRC in 1986, instant-messaging and group chatting became accessible for non-technical users for the first time and after the launch of AOL/AIM in 1992 we already faced the first global community. The invention of Wikipedia in 2001 and various social networks (MySpace, Linkedin and Facebook) forms a community that is connected to the digital world, globally oriented and willing to use collaboration tools not only for social interaction, but to enhance the efficiency at the workplace.\n\nFrom local to global - the needs of a global workforce \nApart from enhancing our efficiency, online collaboration tools face the change that organizations operate globally and the application of flexible working becomes even more important. Collaborative working environments are one of the drivers of the corporate globalization as they offer new business opportunities through innovation and help to and allow to collect knowledge from all over the world. Especially SME\u2019s and large organizations are capable to do business on a global scale by using them. Since 1950 the intensity of collaboration has extremely risen, the flow of information has become faster and the needed skills to carry out work has dramatically increased. Online collaboration tools therefore enable companies to survive in their globally oriented industries.\n\nIBM conducted a study with CIO\u2019s of organizations to find out which trends will most affect business in 2010, coming up with six main points:\n The participatory internet\n Changing workforce demographics\n The rise of software as a service\n The virtualization of data and devices\n Increasing of simplicity of technology\u2019s design and use\nAll of these points are stressing the importance of collaboration and define certain requirements for the future of online collaboration tools in order to consistently enable a wide business collaboration. Online collaboration tools such as social networking websites and web conferencing are demonstrating how fast the environment is changing \u2013 \u201cby 2010, the average salaried worker will actively participate in at least five different ad hoc teams simultaneously\u201d.\n\nWhen asking participants of \u201cThe New Global Study\u201d, a report done by the European Commission in 2009, about the benefits of online collaboration, the following three points were mentioned most:\n Supports coordination within a team (73% of respondents)\n Supports knowledge and learning (69%)\n Allows dispersed team-members to be a better part within the team\n\nSee also \n List of collaborative software\n Collaborative software\n Cloud collaboration\n Document collaboration\n Mass collaboration\n Virtual collaboration\n\nReferences \n\nCollaboration\nCollaborative software", "The Groupement de scientifiques pour l'information sur l'\u00e9nergie nucl\u00e9aire GSIEN (Association of Scientists for Information on Nuclear Energy) is a multidisciplinary  not-for-profit association of independent scientists who aim to spread information about the nuclear industry in France founded on December 15, 1975.\n\nIn addition to providing a structure within which independent evaluations can take place, GSIEN aims to ensure that the French nuclear industry, one of the World's largest, provides open and honest information.\n\nIn 1977 GSIEN was first to provide an explanation of the causes and consequences of the Three Mile Island accident, while the authorities tried to play-down the incident, however GSIEN came to prominence at the time of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster when the press and public found that their independent information helped to compensate for the shortcomings in the official information. They  subsequently became widely recognised after many of their members contributed to various overseas projects.\n\nHistory\nGSIEN was founded in the wake of the launch in 1974 of the Messmer Plan to switch all of France's electricity generation to nuclear power, which took place without public or parliamentary debate. The announcement of the Messmer Plan caused a split in the scientific community between those physicists (generally older) who favoured the plan, and those (generally younger) who were concerned about the potential risks, leading to l\u2019Appel des 400 (the appeal of the 400), a petition signed initially by over 400 scientists, and ultimately by around 4,000, expressing their concern over a number of issues including 'secrecy' and 'official propaganda'. GSIEN was created following this petition, inspired in part by model of the Union of Concerned Scientists in the United States, with the objective of disseminating information to 'prevent nuclear officials from turning information into propaganda'.\n\nIn 1998 Monique Sen\u00e9, nuclear physicist, one of GSIEN's co-founders and its president, was awarded the National Order of the Legion of Honour for her work as anti\u2013nuclear power activist.\n\nActivities\n\nPublications\nSince its first edition in June 1976, GSIEN has published over 250 editions of its quarterly newsletter, la Gazette Nucl\u00e9aire (the Nuclear Gazette).\n\nGSIEN has also published a number of books including Electro-nucl\u00e9aire : danger (1977, ), Plutonium Sur Rh\u00f4ne (1981, )\n\nTechnical expertise\nGSIEN members have been invited by several Local Information Commissions to participate in a number of 10-yearly nuclear plant inspections, including those at Fessenheim, Golfech Nuclear Power Plant and Blayais Nuclear Power Plant, as well as in a various other assessments.\n\nSee also\n\nNuclear power in France\nAnti-nuclear movement in France\n\nExternal links\n La Gazette Nucl\u00e9aire\n\nReferences\n\nNuclear energy in France\nPolitics of France\nAnti-nuclear organizations\nOrganizations established in 1975", "Fly to the Stars (foaled 2 February 1994) is a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire best known for his win in the 1999 Lockinge Stakes. He competed in the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, the United Arab Emirates and the United States, winning six of his twenty-four starts in a racing career which lasted from October 1996 to September 2000.\n\nOriginally trained by Mark Johnston he showed very good form as a three-year-old in 1997 when he won the Britannia Stakes and the Schweppes Golden Mile as well as being placed in the Leopardstown 2,000 Guineas Trial Stakes and the Topkapi Trophy. In 1998 he raced in the ownership of the Godolphin stable and developed into a top-class miler, winning the Prix Messidor and the Prix du Rond Point as well as finishing second in the Royal Hunt Cup, third in the Dubai Duty Free and fifth in the Breeders' Cup Mile. He recorded his biggest win on his first appearance of 1999 with his win in the Lockinge Stakes. He failed to win in five subsequent starts, several of which saw him being employed as a pacemaker for more highly regarded stablemates.\n\nAfter his retirement from racing Fly to the Stars stood as a breeding stallion in France, New Zealand and Poland. He has had moderate results as a sire of winners.\n\nBackground\nFly to the Stars is a dark bay horse with no white markings bred in England by the Hampshire-based Bishop's Down Farm. As a yearling he was offered for sale at Tattersalls in October 1995 and was bought for 125,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Charles Gordon-Watson. The colt entered the ownership of Peter Savill and was sent into training with Mark Johnston at Middleham in North Yorkshire.\n\nHe was sired by Bluebird, a Kentucky-bred, Irish-trained sprinter who won the King's Stand Stakes in 1987. The best of his other progeny included Lake Coniston, Swallow Flight (Sandown Mile), Dolphin Street (Prix de la For\u00eat), Twilight Blues (Duke of York Stakes), Bluegrass Prince (Diomed Stakes), Macaw (Elkhorn Stakes), Aube Indienne (Yellow Ribbon Stakes) and Delilah (Park Hill Stakes). Fly to the Stars' dam Rise and Fall showed little racing ability, finishing unplaced in all of her four starts. Her dam Light Duty was a full-sister to the outstanding racehorse and broodmare Highclere.\n\nRacing career\n\n1996: two-year-old season\nFly to the Stars began his racing career in a maiden race over six furlongs at Newbury Racecourse on 24 October in which he was ridden by Kevin Darley, Starting at odds of 14/1 he finished third of the twenty-three runners behind the Barry Hills trained Za-Im. On 5 November he started favourite for a maiden over seven furlongs at Redcar Racecourse but was beaten into second place by Tayseer.\n\n1997: three-year-old season\nOn his first run of 1997 Fly to the Stars was ridden by Jason Weaver and started 5/6 favourite for an eight-runner maiden over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse on 20 March and recorded his first win, drawing away from his opponents in the final furlong to win by seven lengths. The colt was then stepped up in class and sent to Ireland for the 2000 Guineas Trial Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse for which he started favourite but was beaten a short head by the Jim Bolger-trained Lil's Boy. Despite his defeat he was then moved up to Group One class for the Irish 2000 Guineas at the Curragh in May. He led the field into the straight but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished fifth of the six runners behind Desert King.\n\nFly to the Stars was then dropped in class and stepped up in distance for a ten furlong handicap race at Epsom Racecourse and finished fourth to Jaunty Jack under top weight of 133 pounds. On 17 June the colt was one of twenty-eight three-year-olds to contest the Britannia Handicap over one mile at Royal Ascot. Ridden as on his previous appearance by Olivier Peslier he carried 129 pounds and started at odds of 20/1. After racing behind the leaders he began to make progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead a furlong out and \"ran on well\" to win by one and a half lengths from the Michael Stoute-trained gelding Komi. He was then matched against older handicappers at Sandown Park Racecourse on 16 July and ran poorly, finishing sixteenth of the eighteen runners behind the four-year-old gelding Hawksley Hill. Fifteen days after his disappointing effort at Sandown, Fly to the Stars carried 132 pounds and started at odds of 12/1 for the valuable Schweppes Golden Mile Handicap at Goodwood Racecourse. Peslier positioned Fly to the Stars from the start before sending the colt into the lead inside the final furlong to win by one and a quarter lengths from Crumpton Hill and eighteen others.\n\nIn August Fly to the Stars was sent to France and moved back up to Listed level for the Prix de Tourgeville at Deauville Racecourse and finished second to the Criquette Head-Maarek-trained Marathon. The colt ended his season with a trip to Turkey for a run in the Topkapi Trophy over 1600 metres at Veliefendi Race Course on 13 September. After taking the lead 500 metres out he was overtaken in the straight and finished third behind his fellow British challengers Sandstone and Ramooz.\n\nAt the end of the season he was bought privately by Sheikh Mohammed's Godolphin organisation and was moved to the training stable of Saeed bin Suroor.\n\n1998: four-year-old season\nHaving spent the winter with the Godolphin stable in Dubai, Fly to the Stars began his third season with three races at Nad Al Sheba Racecourse. Racing on dirt, he finished second to Wathik in the first round of the Al Maktoum Challenge in January and third behind the same horse in the third round of the series in February. On Dubai World Cup Night on 28 March he contested the Dubai Duty Free over 2000 metres and finished third behind Annus Mirabilis and Intikhab.\n\nIn June, on his return to European turf racing Fly to the Stars was assigned a weight of 137 pounds for the Royal Hunt Cup and started the 6/1 favourite in a thirty-two-runner field. Ridden by Frankie Dettori, he finished one and a half lengths second to Refuse To Lose, a horse to whom he was conceding twenty-eight pounds. Daragh O'Donohoe took over the ride when Fly to the Stars ran in the Group Three Prix Messidor at Deauville on 12 July and started second favourite behind the Andr\u00e9 Fabre-trained five-year-old Alamo Bay. After leading from the start he was headed by Jim And Tonic 200 metres out but rallied in the closing stages to regain the advantage and win by a head.\n\nAfter a break of three months the colt returned in the Group Two Prix du Rond Point over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in October when he was reunited with Dettori and started second favourite behind Gold Away (runner-up in the Prix Jean Prat and Prix du Moulin). The other runners included Silic, Decorated Hero (winner of the race in 1997) and Ramooz. Fly to the Stars led from the start, accelerated clear of the field in the last 400 metres and won by two and a half lengths from Gold Away. On his final appearance of the season, the colt was sent to the United States for the Breeders' Cup Mile at Churchill Downs on 7 November and ran fifth behind Da Hoss, with Favorite Trick, Cape Cross, Among Men and Desert Prince finishing further back in the field.\n\n1999: five-year-old season\nFly to the Stars began his 1999 campaign in the Group One Lockinge Stakes over one mile at Newbury on 15 May. With Richard Hills partnering the Godolphin stable's first string Intikhab (the 4/7 favourite) the ride on Fly to the Stars (9/1) went to the Irish jockey Willie Supple. The other four runners were Jim And Tonic, Almushtarak (Sandown Mile), Tomba (Prix de la For\u00eat) and Duck Row (third in the St James's Palace Stakes). Racing on soft ground Fly to the Stars took the lead from the start and stayed on \"gamely\" under pressure in the closing stages to win by a lengths and a half from Jim And Tonic with Almushtarak a neck away in third place.\n\nIn two subsequent starts that year, Fly to the Stars failed to reproduce his Newbury form when tried on firmer ground. At Royal Ascot in June he started second favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes but faded badly in the last quarter mile and finished seventh of the eight runners, more than twenty lengths behind the winner Cape Cross. At Longchamp in September he set the pace for his stablemate Aljabr in the Prix du Moulin before finishing eighth behind Sendawar.\n\n2000: six-year-old season\nFly to the Stars remained in training as a six-year-old but failed to win or place in three races. He began his season by running for the second time in the Dubai Duty Free and set the pace before finishing seventh to his stablemate Rhythm Band. On his European seasonal debut he contested the Group Three Diomed Stakes at Epsom Racecourse but after losing a shoe early in the race he finished last of the five runners behind Trans Island. On his final appearance he acted as a pacemaker for Diktat in the Prix du Moulin and led for most of the way before finishing fourth of the eight runners behind Indian Lodge.\n\nStud record\nAt the end of his racing career, Fly to the Stars became a breeding stallion for his owners Darley Stud. He began his stud career at the Haras du Logis in France, and was also \"shuttled\" to stand at the Ashwell Farm in Cambridge, New Zealand. He was later exported to stand in Poland. The best of his offspring have included th Listed winner Salsalavie and the steeplechaser Cafe de Paris.\n\nPedigree\n\nReferences \n\n1994 racehorse births\nRacehorses bred in the United Kingdom\nRacehorses trained in the United Kingdom\nThoroughbred family 2-f", "Charles Edward Kelly (born November 25, 1963) is an American football coach who is the head coach of the UCLA Bruins. He came to prominence as the head coach of the Oregon Ducks from 2009 to 2012, whom he led to four consecutive BCS bowl game appearances, including the 2011 BCS National Championship Game. This success led to him serving as a head coach in the National Football League (NFL) for four seasons, three with the Philadelphia Eagles (2013\u20132015) and one with the San Francisco 49ers (2016). Kelly only made the playoffs in his first season with Philadelphia, and he was fired from both teams. After leaving the NFL, Kelly returned to college football in 2018 to coach UCLA.\n\nEarly life and education\nKelly was born in Dover, New Hampshire. He attended Manchester Central High School and earned his Bachelor of Science in physical education from the University of New Hampshire in 1990. He played quarterback at Manchester Central and defensive back at the University of New Hampshire. Additionally, he played ice hockey and basketball during his high school years.\n\nCoaching career\n\nEarly coaching years\nKelly broke into the coaching ranks in 1990 at Columbia University, where he served as secondary and special teams coach for the freshman team. The next year, he was outside linebackers and strong safeties coach for the varsity team. In 1992, he went to the University of New Hampshire as the running backs coach. He left to become the defensive coordinator at the Johns Hopkins University for one season. He returned to his alma mater as the running backs coach for the next three seasons (1994\u201396). He was just in time to devise a zone-blocking scheme for star Jerry Azumah. From 1995 through 1998, the speedy back raised the profile of UNH football as he rushed for what was then an FCS record 6,193 yards. He changed to the offensive line coach for two seasons (1997\u201398).\n\nKelly was promoted to offensive coordinator at New Hampshire (1999\u20132006). The Wildcats' offenses averaged better than 400 yards per game of total offense in seven of his eight seasons\nIn 2004, the school broke 29 offensive school records; compiling 5,446 yards of total offense and scoring 40 or more points in seven games. Their best offensive output was in 2005 when the Wildcats finished second nationally in total offense (493.5 ypg), third in scoring (41.7 ppg) and fifth in passing (300.1 ypg). They completed the season with an 11\u20132 record.\n\nHe was named the College Assistant Coach of the Year by the Gridiron Club of Greater Boston following the 2005 season in addition to being selected as \"one of college football's hottest coaches\" by American Football Monthly. In 2006, quarterback Ricky Santos won the Walter Payton Award under Kelly's guidance, after Santos finished second in balloting for the award in 2005.\n\nKelly, along with Florida Gators former head coach Dan Mullen, former Winnipeg Blue Bombers offensive coordinator Gary Crowton, and Ohio State head coach Ryan Day, are part of the so-called \"New Hampshire mafia\" as they all have strong connections to New Hampshire.\n\nOregon Ducks (2007\u20132012)\nKelly coached the Oregon Ducks to BCS games in each of his four seasons as head coach; the 2010 Rose Bowl, 2011 BCS National Championship Game, 2012 Rose Bowl, and 2013 Fiesta Bowl. He coached Oregon to three consecutive outright conference championships from 2009 to 2011 and a conference division title in 2012. Oregon won its second consecutive BCS bowl game after they defeated #5 Kansas State in the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. What may be considered the most important part of Kelly's r\u00e9sum\u00e9 at Oregon, however, is that he posted undefeated records against the Ducks most hated rivals, the Oregon State Beavers and the Washington Huskies, something never before achieved by an Oregon coach.\n\nHe was named the 2009 and 2010 Pac-10 Coach of the Year, 2010 Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year, 2010 Walter Camp Coach of the Year, 2010 Sporting News Coach of the Year, 2010 AFCA Coach of the Year Award, and 2010 Associated Press Coach of the Year.\n\nOffensive coordinator\nKelly was hired as offensive coordinator at Oregon in February 2007. His potent spread offense attack was an instant success at Oregon.\n\nIn his first season as offensive coordinator at Oregon, the Ducks led the Pac-10 in scoring (38.15 ppg) and total offense (467.54 ypg), and also became the highest scoring team while amassing the most yards in the history of Oregon football. Prior to Kelly's arrival at Oregon, Dennis Dixon struggled in his first three seasons at quarterback. Under Kelly's guidance, Dixon was the Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Year and emerged as a Heisman Trophy candidate.\n\nIn 2008, the Ducks once again led the Pac-10 in scoring (41.9 ppg) and total offense (484.8 ypg), while breaking the school record marks set the previous season.\n\nHead coach\nOn March 31, 2009, Oregon announced head coach Mike Bellotti would be promoted to athletic director; consequently, Kelly would be promoted to head coach.\n\n2009 season\nKelly helped the Ducks gain national attention in 2009 after an upset of the then #5 USC Trojans on October 31. Kelly became the first Pac-10 coach to win an outright conference championship in his first season, sending the Ducks to the Rose Bowl for the first time since 1995. The Ducks hoped to win their first Rose Bowl since 1917, but lost a close game to Ohio State University. On December 7, 2009, Kelly was named Pac-10 Coach of the year. He was the second Ducks coach to earn the honor, the other being Rich Brooks (two times).\n\n2010 season\n\nPrior to the 2010 season, Kelly suspended Jeremiah Masoli for the season after the quarterback pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary charges, marking the second year in a row that a key player was suspended. Masoli was later dismissed from the team following an arrest for marijuana possession and several driving infractions.\n\nIn early October, Kelly led the team to a #1 spot on the AP, Harris, and USA Today Coaches Poll, followed a few weeks later by a #1 BCS ranking. With a 37\u201320 win over the Oregon State Beavers on December 4, 2010, Kelly led the Ducks to a 9\u20130 finish in conference play, winning their second consecutive outright Pac-10 title. With Darron Thomas at quarterback and Doak Walker Award winner LaMichael James at running back, the Ducks averaged 49.3 points and 537.5 yards per game in the regular season.\n\nIn December, following an undefeated 12\u20130 season and an end-of-season #2 BCS ranking, Oregon was selected to play the #1 Auburn Tigers in the BCS national championship game on January 10, 2011. The Tigers, out of the Southeastern Conference, were coached by Gene Chizik, and had the Heisman Trophy winner at quarterback in Cam Newton. The Ducks lost, 22\u201319, on a last-second, 19-yard field goal by Wes Byrum. It was the closest that a team from the Pacific Northwest has come to winning a share of the national championship since 1991.\n\nIn recognition of his coaching achievements, Kelly received the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year award, the Walter Camp Coach of the Year award and was named Pac-10 Coach of the Year for the second year running. Kelly also won the AP Coach of the Year.\n\n2011 season\nThe 2011 season began with the #3 Ducks facing the #4 LSU Tigers in the Cowboys Classic where they were defeated 40\u201327. Oregon won their next nine games, including a 53\u201330 blowout victory at #3 Stanford.\n\nA consecutive trip back to the BCS Championship appeared to be a strong possibility, but they were defeated 38\u201335 by #18 USC when an Oregon field goal attempt failed as time expired.\n\nThe Ducks won their third straight Pac-12 championship title after defeating UCLA in the inaugural Pac-12 Football Championship Game. They represented the Pac-12 in the Rose Bowl and defeated #10 Wisconsin 45\u201338. It was their second Rose Bowl appearance in three years and their sixth overall. This was Oregon's third consecutive year in a BCS bowl game.\n\nThe Ducks finished the season 12\u20132 (8\u20131 Pac-12) with a #4 final season ranking.\n\n2012 season\nOregon's all-time leading rusher LaMichael James decided to forgo his senior season in 2012 for the NFL and starting quarterback Darron Thomas, with a career starting record of 23\u20133, surprisingly also decided to leave early for the NFL.\n\nLed by redshirt freshman Marcus Mariota at quarterback and senior tailback Kenjon Barner, Oregon rolled to ten straight victories before finally falling to #14 Stanford in overtime 17\u201314 on November 17. Oregon had two opportunities to beat Stanford with a field goal but both attempts failed. Kelly's Ducks would rebound to beat #16 Oregon State in the Civil War for the fifth straight year and play #5 Kansas State in the 2013 Fiesta Bowl. The Ducks proved to be too much for Kansas State as they prevailed to a 35\u201317 victory in Oregon's fourth consecutive year in a BCS bowl game.\n\nThe Ducks finished the season 12\u20131 (8\u20131 Pac-12) with a #2 ranking, putting them in the top five of the final season rankings for the third straight season.\n\nNCAA sanctions\nOn April 16, 2013, The Oregonian reported that the University of Oregon has offered to put its football program on two years' probation in response to NCAA violations that allegedly took place during Kelly's tenure as head coach. On June 26, 2013, the NCAA Committee on Infractions issued its report concluding the investigation into Oregon's use of football scouting services. Oregon received 3 years of probation, reduction of scholarships, but no bowl ban. Kelly received an 18-month show-cause penalty, which would have made an immediate hiring by another NCAA institution difficult. This obstacle became moot, however, after Kelly spent the next four years coaching in the NFL.\n\nNFL interest\nNew York Giants coach Tom Coughlin tried to hire Kelly as a quality control coach in 2006 when Kelly was still the offensive coordinator at the University of New Hampshire. Kelly turned down the offer and shortly after became the offensive coordinator at the University of Oregon.\n\nIn the spring of 2009, Jon Gruden and Kelly spent several days in Tampa, Florida, discussing theories, progressions, and offensive strategies. In November 2010, Kelly visited Pete Carroll at the Seattle Seahawks practice facility during an Oregon bye week.\n\nIn January 2012, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers interviewed Kelly for the head coach position but he declined to take the job because he had \"unfinished business to complete\" with the Ducks.\n\nDuring the 2012 offseason, Kelly met with New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick to discuss how he operated the \"blur\" offense that he ran at Oregon. New England had implemented the hurry up offense as early as 2007. Oregonian columnist John Canzano speculated that Kelly was waiting for the New England Patriots head coaching position to become available.\n\nIn early January 2013, numerous NFL teams expressed interest and Kelly was interviewed by the Buffalo Bills, the Cleveland Browns and Philadelphia Eagles. After a seven-hour meeting with the Browns followed by a nine-hour meeting with the Eagles, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported that Kelly initially decided to remain at Oregon. A week later, Kelly accepted the offer from Philadelphia and became the head coach of the Eagles.\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles (2013\u20132015)\n\nKelly agreed to terms with the Philadelphia Eagles to become the team's head coach on January 16, 2013. Although general manager Howie Roseman ran the team's drafts and free agency signings in his first two seasons with the team, Kelly had the final say over the 53-man roster. His predecessor, Andy Reid, also had the title and/or powers of general manager for most of his tenure.\n\nIn his first season, Kelly reversed the Eagles' fortunes of the previous year. Taking over a team that went 4\u201312 in 2012, Reid's last year, Kelly led the Eagles to a 10\u20136 record and the NFC Eastern Division Championship, becoming just the second head coach in league history to win a division title in his first season in the NFL. They lost in the first round of the playoffs at home to the New Orleans Saints 26\u201324, on a last-second field goal.\n\nIn his second season in Philadelphia, Kelly finished with an identical 10\u20136 record, despite key injuries to players like quarterback Nick Foles and linebacker DeMeco Ryans. However, unlike the previous season, the Eagles failed to make the playoffs in 2014.\n\nOn January 2, 2015, Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie announced that Kelly would assume control of the 90-man roster (including authority over the draft and free agency), while Roseman would be \"elevated\" to the role of Executive Vice President of Football Operations, remaining in control of the salary cap and contracts. Soon afterward, the Eagles traded All-Pro running back LeSean McCoy to the Buffalo Bills for linebacker Kiko Alonso (who was a former Oregon Duck under Kelly) and Pro Bowl quarterback Nick Foles to the St. Louis Rams for quarterback Sam Bradford on March 10, 2015, under Kelly's request. Both trades were met with overwhelmingly negative reception from Eagles fans. He also signed former Cowboys running back and reigning rushing champion DeMarco Murray.\n\nOn December 29, 2015, with the Eagles at 6\u20139, Kelly was fired before the final regular season game, in a statement made by Lurie. It was quickly speculated that he would be a candidate for several NFL head coach openings; on January 7, it was reported that Kelly had met with the San Francisco 49ers about their head coaching position.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (2016)\nOn January 14, 2016, Kelly was hired by the San Francisco 49ers as head coach. He entered the 2016 season as the 49ers' third coach in three seasons, following Jim Harbaugh and Jim Tomsula. In his first game with the 49ers, they defeated the Los Angeles Rams at Levi's Stadium in a 28\u20130 romp. It was the first Week 1 shutout since 2009, when the Seattle Seahawks coincidentally shutout the Rams. However, the 49ers went on a 13-game losing streak, with many speculations opening up that Kelly and general manager Trent Baalke may be fired at the end of the season. In late November, there were also many rumors that Kelly would return to coach the Oregon Ducks after the Ducks finished the season with a 4\u20138 record, the team's first losing season since 2004, resulting in the firing of Ducks football coach Mark Helfrich. Those rumors ceased after the Ducks hired former South Florida Bulls coach Willie Taggart on December 7.\n\nThe 49ers finally got their second win of the season on December 24 in a road game against the Rams, then lost their final game of the season on January 1, 2017, at home against the Seahawks. Following the loss to the Seahawks, and having posted a 2\u201314 record for the season, Kelly was fired by the 49ers, and Baalke was also relieved of his duties after six seasons as the team's general manager.\n\nESPN (2017) \n\nOn May 26, 2017, Kelly was hired by ESPN as a studio analyst for college football.\n\nUCLA Bruins (2018\u2013present) \nOn November 25, 2017, Kelly was hired as the head football coach at UCLA. He had also interviewed for the Florida head coach position. In his first season in 2018, the Bruins began the year 0\u20135 for the first time since 1943. However, they later defeated USC to snap a three-game losing streak against their crosstown rivals. UCLA finished the season with a 3\u20139 record, their worst since going 2\u20137\u20131 in 1971.\n\nThe next season,  the Bruins started 0\u20133, with losses to Cincinnati, San Diego State, and  No. 5  Oklahoma, all by multiple scores. Under Kelly,  the Bruins  started  0\u20133 in back-to-back seasons for the first time since 1920\u20131921. The 0\u20133 start to the 2019 season gave Kelly the worst 15-game start as a UCLA football coach since Harry Trotter. However, when the Bruins played No. 19 Washington State the following week, they erased a 49\u201317 deficit and won, 67\u201363. The 32-point comeback was the third-largest in FBS history.\n\nTwo weeks after the win over Washington State, the Bruins lost at home to Oregon State by a score of 48\u201331. This was only the Beavers' third road win over a Pac-12 opponent since 2014, and their largest road win over a Pac-12 opponent since their 49\u201317 win at California in 2013. The loss dropped the Bruins to a 1\u20135 record for the second consecutive year.\n\nAfter an open date, the Bruins traveled to Stanford and defeated the Cardinal, 34\u201316. UCLA got its first win over Stanford since 2008, snapping an 11-game losing streak against the Cardinal. The Bruins held the Cardinal to 198 total yards and just 55 rushing yards in the victory.\n\nFollowing the Stanford victory, the 2019 Bruins defeated Arizona State 42\u201332 at the Rose Bowl. The Bruins led 42\u201310 heading into the fourth quarter. The Sun Devils were ranked No. 24 in the AP Poll at the time, and they were favored over the Bruins by three points at kickoff. UCLA then defeated Colorado 31\u201314 the next week, also at the Rose Bowl. The wins over Stanford, Arizona State, and Colorado gave the Bruins their first three-game winning streak since 2015.\n\nIn 2022, UCLA began the season 5\u20130 for the first time since 2013, and finished 9\u20134 (6\u20133 in the Pac-12) with a 37\u201335 loss to Pittburgh in the Sun Bowl on a last-second field goal by the Panthers. The Bruins were ranked No. 21 in the final polls. After the season, Kelly signed a two-year contract extension that runs through 2027.\n\nPersonal life\nKelly is reluctant to discuss his life outside of football. He lives in Los Angeles, California but has a small, tight-knit group of friends in Manchester, New Hampshire, who never speak about him to reporters. ESPN blogger Ted Miller describes Kelly as being \"funny, biting, pithy, strange, fiery and surprising when talking to reporters.\"\n\nKelly was married to Jennifer Jenkins from 1992 to 1999.\n\nIn 2009, Kelly responded to a season ticket holder's letter demanding a refund for his expenses after traveling to see Oregon's 19\u20138 loss to Boise State.  That loss ended with Ducks running back LeGarrette Blount responding to a Bronco player's taunts by punching him in the face. Kelly replied to the man with a personal check written out for his travel costs (exactly $439); in response, the fan wrote him a thank you note enclosing the original check, which he did not cash, but made copies of to frame.\n\nAwards\n2009 Pac-10 Coach of the Year\n2010 Pac-10 Coach of the Year\n2010 Associated Press Coach of the Year\n2010 Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year\n2010 Walter Camp Coach of the Year\n2010 Sporting News Coach of the Year\n2010 AFCA Coach of the Year\n2013 Maxwell Club Coach of the Year\n\nBooks about Kelly\nBooks written on Kelly's coaching philosophy and unorthodox strategies:\n\nSaltvelt, Mark (2013) The Tao of Chip Kelly: Lessons from America's Most Innovative Coach.

Bergmann was made a member of the Order of Canada in 2021.\n\nPunk bands\nBergmann began his musical career with an Abbotsford band called the Mount Lehman Grease Band. After Mount Lehman folded, he founded his own band, called the Notorious Smorg Brothers, which he stocked with a myriad of different support artists.\n\nBergmann was later the lead singer and songwriter for Vancouver punk stalwarts Young Canadians (formerly The K-Tels). Although the Young Canadians only recorded two independent EPs and a single before breaking up, their song \"Hawaii\" (co-written with Ross Carpenter) is one of the classic Canadian punk anthems. Although long out of print, the EPs, along with some unreleased live material, were reissued in 1995 as the album No Escape.\n\nSolo career\nIn the 1980s, Bergmann played with Vancouver independent bands Los Popularos and Poisoned before the latter band signed to Duke Street Records in 1988. Due to confusion with the popular American band Poison which had marred the band's most recent tour, however, the label decided to bill the band's releases as solo albums by Bergmann.\n\nHe released his debut solo album, the John Cale-produced Crawl with Me, that year. He garnered a Juno Award nomination for Most Promising Male Vocalist at the Juno Awards of 1989, and James O'Mara and Kate Ryan were nominated for Best Music Video for Bergmann's \"Our Little Secret\".\n\n1990's Sexual Roulette, produced by Chris Wardman, became Bergmann's mainstream breakthrough, spawning the rock radio hit \"Bound for Vegas\" and garnering him a deal with Polygram Records.\n\nHe followed up with a self-titled album on Polygram in 1991, again garnering significant radio airplay for the singles \"Faithlessly Yours\", \"If She Could Sing\" and \"Message From Paul\". In 1994 he collaborated with One Free Fall on a cover of Neil Young's \"Prisoners of Rock and Roll\" for the tribute album Borrowed Tunes, leading to a new deal with Sony Records for 1995's What Fresh Hell Is This?.  That album won the Juno Award for Best Alternative Rock Album at the Juno Awards of 1996, but the album was not a strong performer on the charts and he was then dropped from the label. Bergmann quit the music business for a period following his release by Sony, performing sporadically between 1995 and 1998.\n\nThe 1998 Design Flaw, produced by Peter J. Moore and released on the independent label Other People's Music, was a reworking of tracks from his first three albums, plus a cover of Gram Parsons' \"Sin City\". The songs featured Bergmann on acoustic guitar, with backing by Chris Spedding on electric. Bergmann then released Vultura Freeway, a compilation of unreleased demo recordings from the early 1980s, in 2000, with liner notes from Pointed Sticks front man Nick Jones.\n\nFollowing Vultura Freeway, however, Bergmann withdrew from the music business for several years, due to health difficulties with degenerative arthritis.\n\nIn 2009 Bergmann's bassist Ray Fulber compiled the CD Lost Art Bergmann, which featured early demo versions of most of the songs that appeared on the 1988 John Cale produced album. These demo recordings served as a tonic to many fans as they have a more guitar driven sound than the keyboard heavy Cale produced sessions.\n\nOn August 26, 2014, Bergmann released Songs for the Underclass through the independent label (weewerk).\n\nOn May 13, 2016, Bergmann released The Apostate, his first full-length album of new material since 1995.\n\nOn May 12, 2017, Bergmann released Remember Her Name, a remastered edition of his self-titled 1991 album.\n\nOn December 30, 2020, Bergmann was made a Member of the Order of Canada, for his \"indelible contributions to the Canadian punk music scene, and for his thought-provoking discourse on social, gender and racial inequalities.\"\n\nFilm appearances\nHe has also appeared in two Bruce McDonald films, Highway 61 as Otto and Hard Core Logo as himself, and as a musician in Conjurer of Monikers. Additionally, he was featured in Bloodied but Unbowed, a film featured at the 2010 Vancouver Documentary Film Festival.\n\nDiscography\nCrawl with Me (1988)\nSexual Roulette (1990)\nArt Bergmann (1991) \nWhat Fresh Hell Is This?

In the early 1990s, he took the alias Moguai and began organising his own club nights and parties in Ruhrgebiet and M\u00fcnsterland. He became one of the first techno DJs in Germany, sharing a platform with the likes of Paul van Dyk, Westbam and Sven V\u00e4th. \n\nIn more recent years, however, Moguai's sound has developed to include a combination of tech-house, progressive house, big beat and electro house. He has also worked in more mainstream areas of the music industry, producing for the likes of the Sugababes, Girls Aloud and 2Raumwohnung, which earned him double platinum and gold disc awards.\n\nEarly life and education \n\nTegeler was born in Recklinghausen, North Rhine-Westphalia. He studied for his high school diploma at the Freiherr-von-Stein-Gymnasium in Recklinghausen, after which he completed a two-year apprenticeship in the family butcher business, making him the youngest journeyman butcher in North Rhine-Westphalia. He then went on to study law at the Ruhr University in Bochum, which is where he also embarked upon his career as a DJ and music producer.\n\nCareer\n\nMusic \nIn 1994, Tegeler, now trading under the name Moguai, teamed up with German producer J\u00fcrgen Driessen to release his debut EP, entitled Best Before End, with Important Records. The following year, Moguai set up his own studio with Phil Fuldner, called PUNX Studios. Arguably the studio's greatest successes were Fuldner's The Final (1988), which became the theme tune for the cult manga series Captain Future, and Moguai's Beatbox, which was the first electronic instrumental track to hold 10 weeks in the German top 40.\n\nAt the same time, Moguai collaborated as a remixer with artists such as Giorgio Moroder, Yves Deruyter, Timo Maas, Planet Funk, Cosmic Baby, BBE, Fischerspooner and 2raumwohnung. In 2002 and 2006, respectively, he worked with British production house Xenomania, specifically on their work for bands Sugababes and Girls Aloud on In the Middle (Sugababes) and Something Kinda Ooh (Girls Aloud), respectively. Both of which were reworks of two of Moguai's previous singles U Know Y and Get On. He would later receive credit on the song Come Back to Mine by Xenomania's in-house drummer and recording artist Florrie. He was awarded double platinum records for both of these projects. Similarly, in 2005, he teamed up with German electro-pop duo 2raumwohnung to create the single Sasha (Sex Secret) on the album Es wird Morgen, which went Gold.\n\nSince 2009, Moguai has released his music with Mau5trap, run by Canadian superstar DJ Deadmau5. His first EP release with this label was We Are Lyve (2010), which featured the singles Impereal, Nyce and Blau. Currently, the label represents the likes of Eekkoo, REZZ, and No Mana, but one of its first artists, Skrillex, won three Grammys in 2012, helping secure the great reputation the label enjoys today.\n\nIn March 2011, he joined forces with Mau5trap and Beatport to produce an hour-long progressive house mix, Lyve from Beta, recorded at the Beta Club in Denver, Colorado, and edited using Ableton Live software. The set is made up entirely of his own tracks, making it one of the few albums that combines both live and pre-recorded DJing by the same artist. The success of this album earned him a great deal more international acclaim, with artists such as Britney Spears, Beyonc\u00e9, Fatboy Slim, Underworld, Afrojack and Felix da Housecat approaching him for collaborations and remixes. In January 2012, he released Mpire, again on Mau5trap, collaborating with Kosheen, Fiona Cutler, Polina Goudieva and Tommy Trash.\n\nRadio \nSince 2000, Moguai has been a radio DJ and presenter at Radio 1Live (West German Broadcasting) on the 1Live DJ segment, which runs every Saturday from 22:00 pm to 01:00 am. The show also features guest DJs, and in the past has included the likes of Avicii, Tiesto, Paul van Dyk, Steve Aoki, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike and Turntablerocker. The final hour of the show belongs to the 1Live residents, which include Andhim, AKA AKA, Claptone, Wankelmut and many more.\n\nIn 2007, Moguai was made a resident DJ at German radio station MDR Sputnik, where he plays every third Saturday of the month. In 2008, he launched his own monthly radio podcast on Digitally Imported Radio called Punx Up the Volume. It can also be heard on the radio in the UK, the US, Australia, Russia and Brazil. In 2009, he launched an eponymous two-hour radio show every fourth Thursday with German radio station Sunshine Live.\n\nTelevision\n\nAs host\n\nMTV \n Chillout Zone\n Party Zone\n Select\n In Touch\n\nVIVA \n 5-hour live moderation of Nature One, 2001\n Guest moderator of Mayday, 2001\n Clubrotation\n Berlin House\n\nDiscography \n\nStudio albums\n We Ar Lyve (2010)\n Mpire (2012)\n Colors (2021)\n\nReferences \n\nLiving people\nGerman DJs\nGerman record producers\nGerman house musicians\nMau5trap artists\nPeople from Recklinghausen\nProgressive house musicians\nElectronic dance music DJs\n1973 births", "Katherine Hancock Goode (1872\u20131928) was a teacher, teacher educator, administrator, and state legislator in Illinois.

The show was presented for the first time in Turin April 16, 1966 at Teatro Carignano.\n\nHo visto un re is a satire against power. The narrative voice is that of some peasants who sing and point out that all powerful (the King, the Emperor, the Bishop, the Cardinal, the rich people) as they are touched their interests, even minimally, they start to cry.\nIn contrast, the peasants, even when they are deprived of essential things, have to laugh because their \u00abcry hurt the king it hurts the rich people and the Cardinal, they become sad if we cry\u00bb.\n\nIn the lyrics are inserted a few phrases in Milanese language.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nHo visto un re (English translation)\n\n1968 singles\nItalian songs\n1968 songs\nEnzo Jannacci songs\nSongs with lyrics by Dario Fo\nItalian folk songs\nRCA Records singles", "Claire Smallwood is a freeskier as well as executive director and co-founder of SheJumps, a women's outdoor recreation-focused nonprofit organization facilitating the participation of women and girls in outdoor activities through free and low-cost outdoor education.

The album received critical acclaim and topped the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200. It has sold over 10 million copies worldwide as of 2019.\n\nBackground, artwork and album title\nWhile Liam Howlett is generally responsible for the compositions and Maxim Reality is featured on two tracks, this is the first record to include contributions by Keith Flint, who provides vocals on four of the songs and co-wrote three songs, including the two biggest hits, both of which reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. He is also the vocalist on a cover of the L7 song \"Fuel My Fire\" (from the 1994 album Hungry for Stink). The Fat of the Land album cover featured an image of a blackback crab and a new logo, dropping \"The\" and adding an ant silhouette. The album title comes from the old English phrase 'living off the fat of the land', which means living well or being wealthy.\n\nRelease \nReleased in the first week of July, the album hit number one on the Billboard chart on 19 July 1997. Certified double platinum on 2 December that year, it sold 2,600,000 copies in the United States.\n\nIn 1999, The Fat of the Land entered the Guinness World Records as the fastest-selling UK album. The album was also nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards, but lost to Radiohead's OK Computer.\n\nControversy\nThe National Organization for Women objected to the seeming misogyny of \"Smack My Bitch Up\", though the band maintains that its true interpretation is \"doing anything intensely\". Liam Howlett observed, \"That record was for the fans. Only brainless people get some stupid message out of it\u2026 I'm often misquoted. Some magazine said, 'Liam Howlett says his band are dangerous.'

It was built by renowned local architect and builder Charles Steadman in stuccoed brick with a simple Doric portico. As the chapel of the oldest Presbyterian Seminary in the United States, the building has been home to many of the most important Presbyterian theologians, including the great figures of the Princeton Theology.  The narthex has plaques that honor Samuel Miller, after whom the chapel is named, Charles Hodge, Archibald Alexander Hodge, Caspar Wistar Hodge, Sr., and B. B. Warfield.\n\nHistory\n\nThe chapel originally faced Mercer Street to the east and slightly behind Alexander Hall.  It was designed in the Reformed tradition with one worship space, unifying the choir, congregants, and clergy, and with a central pulpit, emphasizing the proclamation of the Word of God. Originally a twin building was planned so as to flank Alexander Hall with Greek Revival buildings in the same way Nassau Hall was flanked by the original Whig and Clio Halls.\n\nAn 1874 renovation added Victorian stained glass windows and an organ, moving away from the traditional Reformed aversion to instruments in worship.  In 1933 a more substantial renovation by Delano & Aldrich moved the chapel so as to face the interior of the campus, serving as the cornerstone of two squares, bounded by Alexander and Hodge Halls to the north and Stuart and Brown Halls in the south.  The renovation also enlarged the building and removed the Victorian windows so as to restore a more simple appearance, consistent with the Seminary's Reformed heritage.  Later renovations took place in  1964 and 2000.  The chapel is home to the Joe R. Engle Organ, given to the Seminary in 2000.  In addition to daily services the chapel hosts a variety of concerts during the course of the year.  Weddings in the chapel are limited to those where either the bride, groom, or parent of either, is a student, graduate, trustee, or employee of the seminary.\n\nOn January 25, 2022, the Board of Trustees of Princeton Seminary voted to rename Miller Chapel in light of Samuel Miller's direct ties to slavery. \"This decision followed thoughtful deliberation by the Board of Trustees, and it is part of their commitment to the ongoing work of confession and repentance that was part of the historical audit on slavery.\" The new name is Seminary Chapel.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n Nassau Presbyterian Church, a nearby church, also designed by Charles Steadman, in a similar style\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nPrinceton Theological Seminary Miller Chapel\n\nPrinceton Theological Seminary\nCharles Steadman Buildings\nReligious buildings and structures completed in 1834\nChurches in Princeton, New Jersey\nHistoric district contributing properties in New Jersey\nNational Register of Historic Places in Mercer County, New Jersey\nChurches on the National Register of Historic Places in New Jersey", "Mitra Jashni (; born 16 December 1976) is an Iranian visual artist and political activist, of Kurdish ethnicity.

The book, first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg, Holy Roman Empire, offered an alternative model of the universe to Ptolemy's geocentric system, which had been widely accepted since ancient times.\n\nHistory\n\nCopernicus initially outlined his system in a short, untitled, anonymous manuscript that he distributed to several friends, referred to as the Commentariolus. A physician's library list dating to 1514 includes a manuscript whose description matches the Commentariolus, so Copernicus must have begun work on his new system by that time. Most historians believe that he wrote the Commentariolus after his return from Italy, possibly only after 1510. At this time, Copernicus anticipated that he could reconcile the motion of the Earth with the perceived motions of the planets easily, with fewer motions than were necessary in the Alfonsine Tables, the version of the Ptolemaic system current at the time. In particular, the heliocentric Copernican model made use of the Urdi Lemma developed in the 13th century by Mu'ayyad al-Din al-'Urdi, the first of the Maragha astronomers to develop a non-Ptolemaic model of planetary motion.\n\nObservations of Mercury by Bernhard Walther (1430\u20131504) of Nuremberg, a pupil of Regiomontanus, were made available to Copernicus by Johannes Sch\u00f6ner, 45 observations in total, 14 of them with longitude and latitude. Copernicus used three of them in De revolutionibus, giving only longitudes, and erroneously attributing them to Sch\u00f6ner. Copernicus' values differed slightly from the ones published by Sch\u00f6ner in 1544 in Observationes XXX annorum a I. Regiomontano et B. Walthero Norimbergae habitae, [4\u00b0, Norimb. 1544].\n\nA manuscript of De revolutionibus in Copernicus' own hand has survived. After his death, it was given to his pupil, Rheticus, who for publication had only been given a copy without annotations. Via Heidelberg, it ended up in Prague, where it was rediscovered and studied in the 19th century. Close examination of the manuscript, including the different types of paper used, helped scholars  construct an approximate timetable for its composition. Apparently Copernicus began by making a few astronomical observations to provide new data to perfect his models. He may have begun writing the book while still engaged in observations. By the 1530s a substantial part of the book was complete, but Copernicus hesitated to publish. In 1536, Cardinal Nikolaus von Sch\u00f6nberg wrote to Copernicus and urged him to publish his manuscript.\n\nIn 1539, Georg Joachim Rheticus, a young mathematician from Wittenberg, arrived in Frauenburg (Frombork) to study with him. Rheticus read Copernicus' manuscript and immediately wrote a non-technical summary of its main theories in the form of an open letter addressed to Sch\u00f6ner, his astrology teacher in N\u00fcrnberg; he published this letter as the Narratio Prima in Danzig in 1540. Rheticus' friend and mentor Achilles Gasser published a second edition of the Narratio in Basel in 1541. Due to its friendly reception, Copernicus finally agreed to publication of more of his main work\u2014in 1542, a treatise on trigonometry, which was taken from the second book of the still unpublished De revolutionibus. Rheticus published it in Copernicus' name.\n\nUnder strong pressure from Rheticus, and having seen that the first general reception of his work had not been unfavorable, Copernicus finally agreed to give the book to his close friend, Bishop Tiedemann Giese, to be delivered to Rheticus in Wittenberg for printing by Johannes Petreius at N\u00fcrnberg (Nuremberg). It was published just before Copernicus' death, in 1543.\n\nCopernicus kept a copy of his manuscript which, sometime after his death, was sent to Rheticus in the attempt to produce an authentic, unaltered version of the book. The plan failed but the copy was found during the 18th century and was published later. It is kept at the Jagiellonian University Library in Krak\u00f3w,  where it remains bearing the library number BJ 10 000.\n\nContents\n\nFrom the first edition, Copernicus' book was prefixed with an anonymous preface which argues that the following is a calculus consistent with the observations, and cannot resolve philosophical truths. Only later was this revealed to be the unauthorized interjection by Lutheran preacher Andreas Osiander, who lived in Nuremberg when the first edition was printed there. This is followed by Copernicus' own preface, where he dedicates his work to Pope Paul III and appeals to the latter's skill as a mathematician to recognize the truth of Copernicus' hypothesis.\n\nDe revolutionibus is divided into six \"books\" (sections or parts), following closely the layout of Ptolemy's Almagest which it updated and replaced:\n Book I chapters 1\u201311 are a general vision of the heliocentric theory, and a summarized exposition of his cosmology. The world (heavens) is spherical, as is the Earth, and the land and water make a single globe. The celestial bodies, including the Earth, have regular circular and everlasting movements. The Earth rotates on its axis and around the Sun. Answers to why the ancients thought the Earth was central. The order of the planets around the Sun and their periodicity. Chapters 12\u201314 give theorems for chord geometry as well as a table of chords.\n Book II describes the principles of spherical astronomy as a basis for the arguments developed in the following books and gives a comprehensive catalogue of the fixed stars.\n Book III describes his work on the precession of the equinoxes and treats the apparent movements of the Sun and related phenomena.\n Book IV is a similar description of the Moon and its orbital movements.\n Book V explains how to calculate the positions of the wandering stars based on the heliocentric model and gives tables for the five planets.\n Book VI deals with the digression in latitude from the ecliptic of the five planets.\n\nCopernicus argued that the universe comprised eight spheres. The outermost consisted of motionless, fixed stars, with the Sun motionless at the center. The known planets revolved about the Sun, each in its own sphere, in the order: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. The Moon, however, revolved in its sphere around the Earth. What appeared to be the daily revolution of the Sun and fixed stars around the Earth was actually the Earth's daily rotation on its own axis.\n\nCopernicus adhered to one of the standard beliefs of his time, namely that the motions of celestial bodies must be composed of uniform circular motions. For this reason, he was unable to account for the observed apparent motion of the planets without retaining a complex system of epicycles similar to those of the Ptolemaic system.\nDespite Copernicus' adherence to this aspect of ancient astronomy, his radical shift from a geocentric to a heliocentric cosmology was a serious blow to Aristotle's science\u2014and helped usher in the Scientific Revolution.\n\nAd lectorem\n\nRheticus left N\u00fcrnberg to take up his post as professor in Leipzig. Andreas Osiander had taken over the task of supervising the printing and publication. In an effort to reduce the controversial impact of the book Osiander added his own unsigned letter Ad lectorem de hypothesibus huius operis (To the reader concerning the hypotheses of this work) printed in front of Copernicus' preface which was a dedicatory letter to Pope Paul III and which kept the title \"Praefatio authoris\" (to acknowledge that the unsigned letter was not by the book's author).\nOsiander's letter stated that Copernicus' system was mathematics intended to aid computation and not an attempt to declare literal truth:\n\nAs even Osiander's defenders point out, the Ad lectorem \"expresses views on the aim and nature of scientific theories at variance with Copernicus' claims for his own theory\".\nMany view Osiander's letter as a betrayal of science and Copernicus, and an attempt to pass his own thoughts off as those of the book's author. An example of this type of claim can be seen in the Catholic Encyclopedia, which states \"Fortunately for him [the dying Copernicus], he could not see what Osiander had done. This reformer, knowing the attitude of Luther and Melanchthon against the heliocentric system\u00a0... without adding his own name, replaced the preface of Copernicus by another strongly contrasting in spirit with that of Copernicus.\"\n\nWhile Osiander's motives behind the letter have been questioned by many, he has been defended by historian Bruce Wrightsman, who points out he was not an enemy of science. Osiander had many scientific connections including \"Johannes Schoner, Rheticus's teacher, whom Osiander recommended for his post at the Nurnberg Gymnasium; Peter Apian of Ingolstadt University; Hieronymous Schreiber...Joachim Camerarius...Erasmus Reinhold...Joachim Rheticus...and finally, Hieronymous Cardan.\"\n\nThe historian Wrightsman put forward that Osiander did not sign the letter because he \"was such a notorious [Protestant] reformer whose name was well-known and infamous among Catholics\", so that signing would have likely caused negative scrutiny of the work of Copernicus (a loyal Catholic canon and scholar). Copernicus himself had communicated to Osiander his \"own fears that his work would be scrutinized and criticized by the 'peripatetics and theologians',\" and he had already been in trouble with his bishop, Johannes Dantiscus, on account of his former relationship with his mistress and friendship with Dantiscus's enemy and suspected heretic, Alexander Scultetus. It was also possible that Protestant Nurnberg could fall to the forces of the Holy Roman Emperor and since \"the books of hostile theologians could be burned...why not scientific works with the names of hated theologians affixed to them?\" Wrightsman also holds that this is why Copernicus did not mention his top student, Rheticus (a Lutheran) in the book's dedication to the Pope.\n\nOsiander's interest in astronomy was theological, hoping for \"improving the chronology of historical events and thus providing more accurate apocalyptic interpretations of the Bible... [he shared in] the general awareness that the calendar was not in agreement with astronomical movement and therefore, needed to be corrected by devising better models on which to base calculations.\" In an era before the telescope, Osiander (like most of the era's mathematical astronomers) attempted to bridge the \"fundamental incompatibility between Ptolemaic astronomy and Aristotlian physics, and the need to preserve both\", by taking an 'instrumentalist' position. Only the handful of \"Philosophical purists like the Averroists... demanded physical consistency and thus sought for realist models.\"\n\nCopernicus was hampered by his insistence on preserving the idea that celestial bodies had to travel in perfect circles \u2014 he \"was still attached to classical ideas of circular motion around deferents and epicycles, and spheres.\" This was particularly troubling concerning the Earth because he \"attached the Earth's axis rigidly to a Sun-centered sphere. The unfortunate consequence was that the terrestrial rotation axis then maintained the same inclination with respect to the Sun as the sphere turned, eliminating the seasons.\" To explain the seasons, he had to propose a third motion, \"an annual contrary conical sweep of the terrestrial axis\". It was not until the Great Comet of 1577, which moved as if there were no spheres to crash through, that the idea was challenged. In 1609, Kepler fixed Copernicus' theory by stating that the planets orbit the sun not in circles, but ellipses. Only after Kepler's refinement of Copernicus' theory was the need for deferents and epicycles abolished.\n\nIn his work, Copernicus \"used conventional, hypothetical devices like epicycles...as all astronomers had done since antiquity. ...hypothetical constructs solely designed to 'save the phenomena' and aid computation\". Ptolemy's theory contained a hypothesis about the epicycle of Venus that was viewed as absurd if seen as anything other than a geometrical device (its brightness and distance should have varied greatly, but they don't). \"In spite of this defect in Ptolemy's theory, Copernicus' hypothesis predicts approximately the same variations.\" Because of the use of similar terms and similar deficiencies, Osiander could see \"little technical or physical truth-gain\" between one system and the other. It was this attitude towards technical astronomy that had allowed it to \"function since antiquity, despite its inconsistencies with the principles of physics and the philosophical objections of Averroists.\"\n\nWriting Ad lectorem, Osiander was influenced by Pico della Mirandola's idea that humanity \"orders [an intellectual] cosmos out of the chaos of opinions.\" From Pico's writings, Osiander \"learned to extract and synthesize insights from many sources without becoming the slavish follower of any of them.\" The effect of Pico on Osiander was tempered by the influence of Nicholas of Cusa's and his idea of coincidentia oppositorum. Rather than having Pico's focus on human effort, Osiander followed Cusa's idea that understanding the Universe and its Creator only came from divine inspiration rather than intellectual organization. From these influences, Osiander held that in the area of philosophical speculation and scientific hypothesis there are \"no heretics of the intellect\", but when one gets past speculation into truth-claims the Bible is the ultimate measure. By holding Copernicianism was mathematical speculation, Osiander held that it would be silly to hold it up against the accounts of the Bible.\n\nPico's influence on Osiander did not escape Rheticus, who reacted strongly against the Ad lectorem. As historian Robert S. Westman puts it, \"The more profound source of Rheticus's ire however, was Osiander's view of astronomy as a disciple fundamentally incapable of knowing anything with certainty. For Rheticus, this extreme position surely must have resonated uncomfortably with Pico della Mirandola's attack on the foundations of divinatory astrology.\"\n\nIn his Disputations, Pico had made a devastating attack on astrology. Because those who were making astrological predictions relied on astronomers to tell them where the planets were, they also became a target. Pico held that since astronomers who calculate planetary positions could not agree among themselves, how were they to be held as reliable? While Pico could bring into concordance writers like Aristotle, Plato, Plotinus, Averroes, Avicenna, and Aquinas, the lack of consensus he saw in astronomy was a proof to him of its fallibility alongside astrology. Pico pointed out that the astronomers' instruments were imprecise and any imperfection of even a degree made them worthless for astrology, people should not trust astrologists because they should not trust the numbers from astronomers. Pico pointed out that astronomers couldn't even tell where the Sun appeared in the order of the planets as they orbited the Earth (some put it close to the Moon, others among the planets). How, Pico asked, could astrologists possibly claim they could read what was going on when the astronomers they relied on could offer no precision on even basic questions?\n\nAs Westman points out, to Rheticus \"it would seem that Osiander now offered new grounds for endorsing Pico's conclusions: not merely was the disagreement among astronomers grounds for mistrusting the sort of knowledge that they produced, but now Osiander proclaimed that astronomers might construct a world deduced from (possibly) false premises. Thus the conflict between Piconian skepticism and secure principles for the science of the stars was built right into the complex dedicatory apparatus of De Revolutionibus itself.\" According to the notes of Michael Maestlin, \"Rheticus...became embroiled in a very bitter wrangle with the printer [over the Ad lectorem]. Rheticus...suspected Osiander had prefaced the work; if he knew this for certain, he declared, he would rough up the fellow so violently that in future he would mind his own business.\"\n\nObjecting to the Ad lectorem, Tiedemann Giese urged the Nuremberg city council to issue a correction, but this was not done, and the matter was forgotten. Jan Broscius, a supporter of Copernicus, also despaired of the Ad lectorem, writing \"Ptolemy's hypothesis is the earth rests. Copernicus' hypothesis is that the earth is in motion. Can either, therefore, be true?\u00a0... Indeed, Osiander deceives much with that preface of his\u00a0... Hence, someone may well ask: How is one to know which hypothesis is truer, the Ptolemaic or the Copernican?\"\n\nPetreius had sent a copy to Hieronymus Schreiber, an astronomer from N\u00fcrnberg who had substituted for Rheticus as professor of mathematics in Wittenberg while Rheticus was in N\u00fcrnberg supervising the printing.  Schreiber, who died in 1547, left in his copy of the book a note about Osiander's authorship. Via Michael M\u00e4stlin, this copy came to Johannes Kepler, who discovered what Osiander had done and methodically demonstrated that Osiander had indeed added the foreword. The most knowledgeable astronomers of the time had realized that the foreword was Osiander's doing.\n\nOwen Gingerich gives a slightly different version: Kepler knew of Osiander's authorship since he had read about it in one of Schreiber's annotations in his copy of De Revolutionibus; Maestlin learned of the fact from Kepler. Indeed, Maestlin perused Kepler's book, up to the point of leaving a few annotations in it. However, Maestlin already suspected Osiander, because he had bought his De revolutionibus from the widow of Philipp Apian; examining his books, he had found a note attributing the introduction to Osiander.\n\nJohannes Praetorius (1537\u20131616), who learned of Osiander's authorship from Rheticus during a visit to him in Krak\u00f3w, wrote Osiander's name in the margin of the foreword in his copy of De revolutionibus.\n\nAll three early editions of De revolutionibus included Osiander's foreword.\n\nReception\nEven before the 1543 publication of De revolutionibus, rumors circulated\nabout its central theses. Martin Luther is quoted as saying in 1539:\n\nPeople gave ear to an upstart astrologer who strove to show that the earth revolves, not the heavens or the firmament, the sun and the moon\u00a0... This fool wishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy; but sacred Scripture tells us [Joshua 10:13] that Joshua commanded the sun to stand still, and not the earth.\n\nWhen the book was finally published, demand was low, with an initial print run of 400 failing to sell out. Copernicus had made the book extremely technical, unreadable to all but the most advanced astronomers of the day, allowing it to disseminate into their ranks before stirring great controversy. And, like Osiander, contemporary mathematicians and astronomers encouraged its audience to view it as a useful mathematical model without necessarily being true about causes, thereby somewhat shielding it from accusations of blasphemy.\n\nAmong some astronomers, the book \"at once took its place as a worthy successor to the Almagest of Ptolemy, which had hitherto been the Alpha and Omega of astronomers\". Erasmus Reinhold hailed the work in 1542 and by 1551 had developed the Prutenic Tables (\"Prussian Tables\"; ; ) using Copernicus' methods. The Prutenic Tables, published in 1551, were used as a basis for the calendar reform instituted in 1582 by Pope Gregory XIII. They were also used by sailors and maritime explorers, whose 15th-century predecessors had used Regiomontanus' Table of the Stars. In England, Robert Recorde, John Dee, Thomas Digges and William Gilbert were among those who adopted his position; in Germany, Christian Wurstisen, Christoph Rothmann and Michael M\u00e4stlin, the teacher of Johannes Kepler; in Italy, Giambattista Benedetti and Giordano Bruno whilst Franciscus Patricius accepted the rotation of the Earth. In Spain, rules published in 1561 for the curriculum of the University of Salamanca gave students the choice between studying Ptolemy or Copernicus. One of those students, Diego de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, published an acceptance of Copernican theory in 1584.\n\nVery soon, nevertheless, Copernicus' theory was attacked with Scripture and with the common Aristotelian proofs. In 1549, Melanchthon, Luther's principal lieutenant, wrote against Copernicus, pointing to the theory's apparent conflict with Scripture and advocating that \"severe measures\" be taken to restrain the impiety of Copernicans.\nThe works of Copernicus and Z\u00fa\u00f1iga\u2014the latter for asserting that De revolutionibus was compatible with Catholic faith\u2014were placed on the Index of Forbidden Books by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of March 5, 1616 (more than 70 years after Copernicus' publication):\n\nThis Holy Congregation has also learned about the spreading and acceptance by many of the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to the Holy Scripture, that the earth moves and the sun is motionless, which is also taught by Nicholaus Copernicus' De revolutionibus orbium coelestium and by Diego de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga's In Job\u00a0... Therefore, in order that this opinion may not creep any further to the prejudice of Catholic truth, the Congregation has decided that the books by Nicolaus Copernicus [De revolutionibus] and Diego de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga [In Job] be suspended until corrected.\n\nDe revolutionibus was not formally banned but merely withdrawn from circulation, pending \"corrections\" that would clarify the theory's status as hypothesis. Nine sentences that represented the heliocentric system as certain were to be omitted or changed. After these corrections were prepared and formally approved in 1620 the reading of the book was permitted. But the book was never reprinted with the changes and was available in Catholic jurisdictions only to suitably qualified scholars, by special request. It remained on the Index until 1758, when Pope Benedict XIV (1740\u201358) removed the uncorrected book from his revised Index.\n\nCensus of copies\nArthur Koestler described De revolutionibus as \"The Book That Nobody Read\" saying the book \"was and is an all-time worst seller\", despite the fact that it was reprinted four times. Owen Gingerich, a writer on both Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler, disproved this after a 35-year project to examine every surviving copy of the first two editions. Gingerich showed that nearly all the leading mathematicians and astronomers of the time owned and read the book; however, his analysis of the marginalia shows that they almost all ignored the cosmology at the beginning of the book and were only interested in Copernicus' new equant-free models of planetary motion in the later chapters. Also, Nicolaus Reimers in 1587 translated the book into German.\n\nGingerich's efforts and conclusions are recounted in The Book Nobody Read, published in 2004 by Walker & Co. His census included 276 copies of the first edition (by comparison, there are 228 extant copies of the First Folio of Shakespeare) and 325 copies of the second. The research behind this book earned its author the Polish government's Order of Merit in 1981. Due largely to  Gingerich's scholarship, De revolutionibus has been researched and catalogued better than any other first-edition historic text except for the original Gutenberg Bible.\nOne of the copies now resides at the Archives of the University of Santo Tomas in the Miguel de Benavides Library. In January 2017, a second-edition copy was stolen as part of a heist of rare books from Heathrow Airport and remains unrecovered.\n\nEditions\n\n 1543, Nuremberg, by Johannes Petreius a copy of this is held at University of Edinburgh, owned by an astronomer, who filled the pages with scholarly annotations,  and subsequently owned by the Scottish economist Adam Smith.\n 1566, Basel, by Henricus Petrus\n 1617, Amsterdam, by Nicolaus Mulerius\n 1854, Warsaw, with Polish translation and the authentic preface by Copernicus.\n 1873, Thorn, German translation sponsored by the local Coppernicus Society, with all Copernicus' textual corrections given as footnotes.\n\nTranslations\nEnglish translations of De revolutionibus have included:\nOn the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres, translated by C.

Following independence from the United Kingdom in 1976, Seychelles was a sovereign republic until 1977, when the original President and leader of the Seychelles Democratic Party, James Mancham, was overthrown in a bloodless coup by the Prime Minister France-Albert Ren\u00e9. Ren\u00e9 installed a single-party socialist state under the Seychelles People's Progressive Front which remained in place until 1993, when multiparty elections took place for the first time since independence. Modern day Seychelles governance takes place in a framework of a presidential republic, whereby the President of Seychelles is both head of state and head of government, and of a multi-party system. Executive power is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both the government and the National Assembly.\n\nPolitical history\n\nPre-independence political movements \nWhile under British colonization, the people of the Seychelles had little to no say in how they were governed. Following the end of World War I, however, this began to change. The first political movement in the Seychelles was the Planters Association, which came into existence around 1918. In addition to the movement of the Planters Association, workers in the Seychelles petitioned the government about their poor working conditions and tax structure, which led to some proposed reform by the governor at the time, Governor Sir Arthur Grimble. Ultimately though, these reforms did not go into action, as the beginning of World War II put everything on hold.\n\nThe Planters Association was primarily focused on the interests of rich, white landowners and not the workers whom they employed. The League of Coloured Peoples formed as a result, and demanded minimum wage laws and health care reform.\n\nThe first actual political party, the Taxpayers Association, was not formed until 1939. This Taxpayers Association was also an organization primarily made up of rich white landowners, so its goals were, again, purely the advancement of their personal interests and the interests of the plantocracy.\n\n1948 marked the first year in which Seychelles enjoyed any sort of suffrage, but it was limited only to literate property owners, which made up just 2,000 people in a population of over 36,000. As a result of the first elections in 1948, most representatives on the new Legislative Council were members of either the Planters' or Taxpayers' organizations.\n\nIn 1964, the Socialist Seychelles People's United Party (SPUP) was formed. Led by London-educated lawyer France Albert Rene, they campaigned on a platform of autonomy from Britain. Another London-educated lawyer, James Mancham headed the Seychelles Democratic Party (SDP), which was created the same year, and by contrast wanted closer integration with Britain. Early elections between these two parties seemed in part based on the personal rivalry between these two leaders.\n\nAs a result of the 1967 elections, the first elections under universal adult suffrage, each party gained three seats in the legislature. Mancham's SDP retained a single-seat lead in the legislature, despite the SPUP having a slight margin of victory in number of votes. This result was met with protests and strikes by supporters of the SPUP throughout the following year.\n\n1970 brought constitutional revisions to the colonial government of Seychelles, instituting a smaller-scale parliamentary system, but leaving plurality voting for the single-member districts. In the following elections in both 1970 and 1974, Mancham gained a small majority in votes, but a large one in seats, through a voting system which relied on the principle of \"first past the post\". Specifically in the 1974 elections, Mancham's SDP won a disproportionate amount of seats, 13 out of 15, with just barely over half of the vote.\n\nSocial unrest was rampant during this period, with strikes and protests, as well as bombings in 1972, all attributed to the SPUP. While this was partially attributable to the issues faced with the voting system, tensions regarding independence and rumored political repression and jailing of SPUP activists was also a factor.\n\nIn June 1975, the SDP and SPUP began a coalition government in order to negotiate independence with Britain. The British Government was asked to appoint an electoral review commission so that differences in opinion on legislative makeup and representation could be reconciled. An informal agreement between the two parties was reached, and ten seats were added to the Legislative Assembly, five to be nominated by each party. A cabinet of ministers also was formed consisting of eight members of the DP and four of the SPUP, with Chief Minister Mancham becoming prime minister.\n\nIndependence\nAlthough Mancham's SDP had initially opposed independence, public opinion on the island heavily favored it, and on June 29, 1976, the British officially granted independence to the Seychelles. Mancham was named the new president, and Ren\u00e9 became prime minister. The new government kept the original distribution of seats per their 1975 agreement. Each party agreed to a \"grand coalition\" until 1979, when the next elections would take place.\n\nLess than one year after independence, on 5 June 1977, the SPUP overthrew the newly formed government in a bloodless coup while Mancham was overseas at a Commonwealth conference in London. Ren\u00e9 initially denied involvement, but eventually took responsibility as leader of the SPUP. This coup was claimed to have been to prevent the establishment of a one-party state, but likely was more motivated by the SPUP's lack of representation in the newly formed legislature.\u00a0Following the coup, Ren\u00e9 was installed as president and ruled by proclamation for the next two years, before imposing a new constitution in 1979 without referendum. During this period, the SPUP was formally renamed the Seychelles People's Progressive Front, and became the sole ruling party of the new single-party socialist state.\u00a0New elections were also called in 1979, and Rene was formally elected President of Seychelles.\n\nOne-party socialism \n\nOne-party socialism was established in the Seychelles in 1979 by France-Albert Rene and his SPUP, and ended in 1991. During this time the state built one of Africa's highest gross domestic products per capita.\n\nReturn to multiparty system\nAfter almost sixteen years of one-party rule, President Rene announced a return to the multiparty system of government at an Extraordinary Congress of the ruling Seychelles People's Progressive Front (SPPF) on 4 December 1991. On 27 December 1991, the Constitution of Seychelles was amended to allow for the registration of political parties. Among the exiles returning to Seychelles was James Mancham, who returned in April 1992 to revive his party, the Democratic Party (DP). By the end of that month, eight political parties had registered to contest the first stage of the transition process: election to the Constitutional Commission, which took place on 23\u201326 July 1992.\n\nThe Constitutional Commission was made up of twenty two elected members, fourteen from the SPPF and eight from the DP. It commenced work on 27 August 1992 with both President Rene and Mancham calling for national reconciliation and consensus on a new democratic constitution. A consensus text was agreed upon on 7 May 1993 and a referendum to approve it called for 15\u201318 June. The draft was approved with 73.9% of the electorate in favor of it and 24.1% against.\n\n23\u201326 July 1993 saw the first multiparty presidential and legislative elections held under the new constitution, as well as a resounding victory for President Rene. Three political groups contested the elections\u2014the SPPF, the DP, and the United Opposition (UO)\u2014a coalition of three smaller political parties, including Parti Seselwa. Two other smaller opposition parties threw in their lot with the DP. All participating parties and international observer groups accepted the results as \"free and fair.\"\n\nThree candidates again contested the 1998 presidential election: Albert Rene (SPPF), James Mancham (DP), and Wavel Ramkalawan. Again, President Rene and his SPPF party enjoyed a landslide victory. The President's vote in the 20\u201322 March elections jumped to 66.6% from 59.5% in 1993, while the SPPF garnered 61.7% of the total votes cast in the National Assembly election, compared to 56.5% in 1993.\n\nThe twenty-first century\nEarly elections originally set for 2003 were called in August/September 2001. The Government Party SPPF again prevailed, although the main Opposition Party, Seychelles National Party (previously known as the United Opposition Party) headed by Wavel Ramkalawan, made a surprisingly strong showing and collected 46% of the total votes. The DP, headed by Mancham, did not take part in the elections.\n\nIn April 2004, Rene retired as president, passing the office to his vice president, James Michel. At the next presidential election in July 2006, Michel polled 53.7% of valid votes, Wavel Ramkalawan 45.7% and Phillip Boulle 0.6%. In the May 2007 National Assembly elections, Seychelles People's Progressive Front took 56.2% of votes and Seychelles National Party in coalition with Seychelles Democratic Party took 43.8%. This gave SPPF 18 directly elected seats plus 5 nominated, total 23 seats with the SNP/DP coalition taking 7 directly elected plus 4 nominated, total 11 seats. The former vice-president, Danny Faure, was sworn in as president in October 2016, following the surprise resignation of James Michel.\n\nThe new National Assembly building on Ile du Port, Victoria opened in 2009. The building was partly financed by the Government of China.\n\nWavel Ramkalawan is the current President of Seychelles, and was elected in October 2020. Anglican priest Wavel Ramkalawan defeated President Danny Faure by 54.9% to 43.5%. The opposition took power in the Seychelles for the first time since 1977, following its victory in the presidential election.\n\nThe election of the National Assembly was held on the 22\u201324 October 2020. The Seychelles National Party, the Seychelles Party for Social Justice and Democracy and the Seychelles United Party formed a coalition, Linyon Demokratik Seselwa (LDS). LDS won 25 and former ruling party United Seychelles (US) 10 seats of the 35 seats of the National Assembly.\n\nExecutive branch\n\n|President\n|Wavel Ramkalawan\n|LDS\n|26 October 2020\n|}\n\nThe President of Seychelles, who is both head of state and head of government, is elected by popular vote for a five-year term of office, and can be re-elected only once.\n\nThe cabinet is presided over and appointed by the President, subject to the approval of a majority of the legislature.\n\nLegislative branch\nThe National Assembly/Assembl\u00e9e Nationale has 34 members, elected for a term of five years, 25 members elected in single-seat constituencies and 9 members elected by proportional representation.\n\nPolitical parties and elections\n\nPresidential elections\n\nParliamentary elections\n\nAdministrative divisions\nSeychelles is divided in 25 administrative districts; Anse aux Pins, Anse Boileau, Anse Etoile, Anse Royale, Au Cap, Baie Lazare, Baie Sainte Anne, Beau Vallon, Bel Air, Bel Ombre, Cascade, English River, Glacis, Grand' Anse (on Mahe), Grand' Anse (on Praslin), Inner Islands, Les mamelles, Mont Buxton, Mont Fleuri, Plaisance, Pointe Larue, Port Glaud, Roche Caiman, Saint Louis, Takamaka.\n\nInternational organization participation\n\nAgence de Coop\u00e9ration Culturelle et Technique, ACP, AfDB, African Union, Commonwealth of Nations, ECA, FAO, Group of 77, IBRD, ICAO, International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, IFAD, International Finance Corporation, IFRCS, International Labour Organization, International Monetary Fund, International Maritime Organization, InOC, Intelsat (nonsignatory user), Interpol, IOC, International Organization for Standardization (correspondent), International Trade Union Confederation, Non-Aligned Movement, OPCW, Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa (PMAESA), Southern African Development Community, UN, UNCTAD, UNESCO, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, UPU, World Health Organization, WMO, WToO, WTrO (applicant).\n\nReferences", "Leptocarpus denmarkicus is a species of plant in the Restionaceae (rush) family, endemic to Western Australia.\n\nIt was first described in 1943 by Karl Suessenguth as Meeboldina denmarkica.

It originally aired on January 6, 1961 on CBS, and was the 12th episode of the second season. The episode was written by series creator Rod Serling, and was directed by Douglas Heyes. It starred Thomas Gomez in his second appearance on the show following \"Escape Clause\", as well as Vladimir Sokoloff, in the first of his three appearances on the series.\n\nOpening narration\n\nPlot\nIn the Old West, in a desolate barren town, the sadistic and unscrupulous peddler Sykes mocks Luis Gallegos, who is due to be hanged. Luis is guilty of driving drunk and accidentally killing a child. Luis' father arrives in the village and pleads with the mother and father of the dead girl to spare his son the hanging. His pleas fall on deaf ears. After selling the executioner some five-strand rope needed for the hanging, Sykes sells a bag of dust to the condemned man's father, collecting ordinary dirt from the ground and insisting that it is magic dust that will spread good will throughout the crowd and make them feel love and sympathy for Luis.\n\nAs the crowd gathers for the hanging, Luis' father cries out and starts sprinkling the dust everywhere. He hears the trapdoor drop behind him and turns to see that the fresh and sturdy rope has snapped above the noose, and Luis is unharmed. When asked if another hanging attempt should be made, the girl's parents decide that it should not, that Luis has suffered enough and maybe they have had a sign from God. As father and son walk home, Sykes rechecks the rope which appears to be in perfect condition. Then he throws his gold pieces from the sale of the dust to the poor children of the town, insisting that they have them. He walks away from the scene bemused, stating that the dust must have been magic after all.\n\nClosing narration\n\nCast\n Thomas Gomez as Sykes \n Vladimir Sokoloff as Gallegos \n John Larch as The Sheriff \n John Alonzo as Luis Gallegos\n Paul Genge as John Canfield \n Dorothy Adams as Mrs. Canfield\n Duane Grey as Rogers \n Andrea Darvi as Estrellita Gallegos\n\nSee also\n List of The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series) episodes\n\nReferences\nDeVoe, Bill.

Owned by Gray Television, it serves as an ultra high frequency (UHF) translator of Gray's two full-power stations in the Cleveland market: WOIO (channel 19), a Shaker Heights\u2013licensed CBS affiliate, and WUAB (channel 43), a Lorain\u2013licensed CW affiliate, both of which broadcast over the same spectrum via a channel sharing agreement.\n\nWOHZ-CD's transmitter is located northeast of Canton, while WOIO and WUAB share studios on the ground floor of the Reserve Square building in Downtown Cleveland.\n\nHistory \nOriginally licensed to Mansfield, Ohio, this station took to the air on May 7, 1990, as W50BE. An extension of locally owned WVNO-FM and WRGM, W50BE was an independent station boasting a lineup of local newscasts and community programming for the Mansfield/Ashland/Bucyrus region, nearly equidistant from both the Cleveland and Columbus markets. After W50BE owner Mid-State Television, Inc., headed by Robert Meisse, acquired the license to WCOM-TV, that station was relaunched as WMFD-TV \"TV68/50\" on June 1, 1992, simulcasting W50BE's programming.\n\nBy the beginning of 1996, W50BE changed call signs to WOHZ-LP and was relaunched as \"Z-50\", offering additional local programming as a WMFD-TV extension alongside America One fare. Later upgraded to a Class A station as WOHZ-CA, it also began to offer weather information and an audio simulcast of WVNO-FM from a combined studio facility in Ontario, Ohio. The station was licensed for digital operation on February 26, 2015, assuming the call sign WOHZ-CD.\n\nOn October 8, 2020, Mid-State Television sold WOHZ-CD to Atlanta\u2013based Gray Television, owner of WOIO and WUAB, for $450,000. The sale was completed on December 8, 2020. Upon taking over WOHZ-CD, Gray Television changed the station's city of license to Canton, Ohio, and began using it as a repeater for WOIO and WUAB, increasing coverage for the two stations in the southern part of the Cleveland/Northeast Ohio TV market.\n\nSubchannels \nThe station's digital signal is multiplexed:\n\nSee also \nTallest structures in the United States, relating to the old WCOM tower.\n\nReferences \n\nTelevision channels and stations established in 1990\nLow-power television stations in the United States\nCBS network affiliates\nThe CW affiliates\nOHZ-CD\n1990 establishments in Ohio\nCanton, Ohio\nGray Television", "Cooker may refer to several types of cooking appliances and devices used for cooking foods.\n\nCookers\n\n AGA cooker \u2013 a heat storage stove and cooker, which works on the principle that a heavy frame made from cast iron components can absorb heat from a relatively low-intensity but continuously-burning source, and the accumulated heat can then be used when needed for cooking.  Originally heated by slow-burning coal, the Aga cooker was invented in 1922 by the Nobel Prize-winning Swedish physicist Gustaf Dal\u00e9n (1869\u20131937), who was employed first as the chief engineer of the Swedish AGA company.\n Cook stove \u2013 heated by burning wood, charcoal, animal dung or crop residue. Cook stoves are commonly used for cooking and heating food in households that lack access to clean, modern facilities for cooking.\n Electric cooker \u2013 an electric powered cooking device for heating and cooking of food\n Gas stove (British English) \u2013 uses natural gas, propane, butane, liquefied petroleum gas or other flammable gas as a fuel source. Most modern stoves come in a unit with built-in extractor hoods.\n Induction cooker \u2013 heats a cooking vessel with induction heating, instead of infrared radiation from electrical wires or a gas flame as with a traditional cooking stove. For all models of induction cooktop, a cooking vessel must be made of a ferromagnetic metal such as cast iron or stainless steel or at least compounded with a steel inlay. Copper, glass and aluminum vessels can be placed on a ferromagnetic interface disk which enables these materials to be used.\n Kitchen stove (British English) \u2013 a kitchen appliance designed for the purpose of cooking food. Kitchen stoves rely on the application of direct heat for the cooking process and may also contain an oven, used for baking.\n Pressure cooker \u2013 heats food quickly because the internal steam pressure from the boiling liquid causes saturated steam (or \"wet steam\") to bombard and permeate the food. Thus, higher temperature water vapour (i.e., increased energy), which transfers heat more rapidly compared to dry air, cooks food very quickly.\n Rice cooker \u2013 also referred to as a rice steamer, is an electric kitchen appliance used to boil or steam rice. Apart from cooking rice, there are multiple recipes cooking options in modern rice cookers such as cooking lentils in rice cooker recipe, etc. Electric rice cookers were developed in Japan, where they are known as suihanki (Jap.: \u708a\u98ef\u5668).\n Slow cooker \u2013 also known as a Crock-Pot, (a trademark that is sometimes used generically in the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand), is a countertop electrical cooking appliance that is used for simmering, which requires maintaining a relatively low temperature. It allows for the unattended cooking for many hours of pot roast, stews, soups, \"boiled\" dinners and other suitable dishes, including dips, desserts and beverages.\n Solar cooker \u2013 a device which uses the energy of direct sunlight to heat, cook or pasteurize food or drink. Many solar cookers presently in use are relatively inexpensive, low-tech devices, although some are as powerful or as expensive as traditional stoves, and advanced, large-scale solar cookers can cook for hundreds of people.\n The Cooker is the given name to a coin-activated robot made out of an oven and storage cabinet that patrols the moon, as seen in the 1989 Wallace and Gromit short, A Grand Day Out. It is very protective of the moon and becomes hostile when it discovers that Wallace and Gromit have landed there. It secretly has a lifelong dream of skiing. As well as being called The Cooker, an audio adaptation of A Grand Day Out refers to it as The Moon Machine.\n\nSee also\n\n The Cooker, 1958 album by Lee Morgan\n Cooking apple\n Cook (profession)\n List of cooking appliances\n List of cooking techniques\n List of cooking vessels\n List of ovens\n List of stoves\n List of words having different meanings in British and American English: A\u2013L#C\n\nReferences\n\nCooking appliances\nOvens\nStoves", "The Everlasting Blues vs. Otis Spann \u00e8 un album live di Otis Spann, pubblicato dalla Spivey Records nel 1972.

He served in the First and Second World Wars, and was killed in the sinking of  by the German battleship Bismarck at the Battle of the Denmark Strait.\n\nEarly life\nKerr was born on 16 August 1891, the only son of Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Russell Kerr, and his wife Lady Kerr, of Newnham on Severn, Gloucestershire.  He joined the Royal Navy on 15 May 1904, and after service as a cadet he rose through the ranks, being promoted to Lieutenant on 28 February 1914. He served in the First World War, spending most of the period aboard the battleship , the flagship of Admiral Sir Doveton Sturdee. He was present at the Battle of Jutland in May 1916, and by 1918 he had been given his own command, that of the destroyer .\n\nWith the destroyers\nKerr was promoted to commander on 30 June 1927, and in December 1928 he was given command of the destroyer , followed by  in August 1929. He commanded Thruster until February 1931, and after a year on land, returned to sea in February 1932 in command of .  Promotion to captain followed on 30 June 1935, and on 6 September 1935 he became commander of the Flotilla leader and captain (D) of the 21st Destroyer Flotilla. He stepped down from the position on 22 May 1936.  His commander, Admiral Thomson, reported that he had found Kerr to be \"A very capable Captain (D) who has trained his Flotilla well. An officer probably much better suited to the practical side of naval life rather than to Staff duties. A strong personality with definite powers of command and a very good seaman. Most loyal and is very thorough in the carrying out of his duties. Social qualities good. Physically fit and has good powers of endurance.\"\n\nKerr became senior officer, Reserve Fleet aboard  in July 1936, transferring to  on 3 November 1936. As well as being the senior officer of the reserve fleet he then also became chief staff officer to the rear-admiral of the 10th Cruiser Squadron, where he remained for the next year, until July 1937.  Vice-Admiral Sir Gerald Dickens also produced a highly favourable report, noting that Kerr was \"A very keen zealous officer who has done well as Senior Officer Reserve Fleet. Has plenty of character and drive and is mentally alert. A good seaman and a sound administrator. Very loyal, while ambitious to do well. Good social qualities. Keeps fit.\"\n\nKerr was to have then received an appointment to command the Flotilla leader , where he would be captain (D) of the 8th Destroyer Flotilla.  The appointment was cancelled before he could take it up, however. Instead, after a period of training, he became commander of  and captain (D) of the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla. During this period he served under Vice-Admiral John Tovey, and impressed both him, and the Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Admiral Sir Dudley Pound. Kerr then took command of  and the 15th Destroyer Flotilla, later transferring to the shore establishment HMS Cochrane, at Rosyth on 30 August 1939.  He remained at Rosyth with the Rosyth Destroyer Force until 24 January 1940, spending time on the staff of the commander-in-chief, Rosyth. He was awarded the CBE in 1940.\n\nHMS Hood\nKerr took command of the battlecruiser  on 15 February 1941.  Command of the Navy's largest capital ship was a major change, Kerr having only previously commanded destroyers. He took her to sea on the completion of her refit in mid March, and carried out gunnery exercises and patrols off Iceland. He was commander of Hood for just three months, when he was killed at the Battle of the Denmark Strait, along with most of his crew, when Hood was sunk by the German battleship Bismarck. He was posthumously mentioned in dispatches. Kerr is commemorated on Portsmouth Naval Memorial.\n\nFamily\nHe had married Margaret Augusta Kerr on 14 February 1920, the marriage producing two children, Russell and Jane.  They resided in St John's Wood, London.  Russell Kerr, who had served as a captain in the Royal Artillery and as a tank commander, was killed while fighting in Burma in 1945.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nKerr's biography at hmshood.com\n\n1891 births\n1941 deaths\nCaptains who went down with the ship\nRoyal Navy officers\nCommanders of the Order of the British Empire\nPeople from Newnham on Severn\nRoyal Navy officers of World War II\nRoyal Navy personnel killed in World War II\nRoyal Navy officers of World War I\nPeople lost at sea", "Jean-Pierre Fran\u00e7ois (born on 7 June 1965) is a French singer and former footballer.

Sypniewskis can also be found all over the world, particularly in the United States, Brazil, and Germany.\n\n\"Sypniewski\" roughly translates as \"one who originates from Sypniewo' \u2013 (that is from Sypien's settlement). There are several manorial estates which bear the name of Sypniewo or a similar spelling as in the German \"Zippnow\".\n\nEtymology\nThe etymology of 'Sypien' suggests the use of water in association with the making or use of a clay vessel or fortification and the breeding or capture of fish. In short, the origins suggest a clan that lived either in a fortified place on or near water (rivers/lakes) or who kept game and fisheries. In all likelihood both options apply. Most of the old manorial estates bearing the name Sypniewo are located near or on a lake or river (i.e. Lake Margonin). In German the name is translated as 'Seeort' (place on the lake).\n\nNobility patent, manorial estates and origins\nThe Sypniewskis belong to Pomeranian nobility, Polish Szlachta (nobility), Prussian nobility, and later to German and Austrian nobilities (after partition of Poland), and, although mentioned already c. 1390 and earlier (as Siebnitz and/or Zipniv Pomeranian nobility), obtained a formal Polish nobility patent in writing from the king Casimir IV Jagiellon, who granted them the right to keep and use the Odrow\u0105\u017c coat of arms in 1480. Zlota Ksiega Szlachty Polskiej (\"Golden Book of Polish Nobility\") states that the Sypniewski \u2013 Odrowaz arms are said to have come from the Podg\u00f3rze region, recorded around 1190 (there are still few Sypniewski families owning land and living in this area today). Their further nobility confirmations through Bonifacius Sypniewski is dated in 1483 and confirmed in German Nobility Book. A Jan Sypniewski resettled in the Brzesko-Litewskie province (presently part of Lithuania, back then center of Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth), and branches are found in Pozna\u0144, Nowy S\u0105cz, and Prussia. Around the 16th century, the Sypniewski family is found living in Greater Poland owning large manorial estates there, and later we find them in West Prussia on the estate of Zmijewie (Kojalowicz, Niesiecki, Goluchowski).\n\nVarious other documents found in Polish archives refer to the family and its holdings in and around, what was later to become, the Silesian and Prussian/German/Polish border. On the division of Poland in the 18th century, the Sypniewski family is then also mentioned as Prussian nobility, and is found in Siebmacher's Wappenbuch under the Odrow\u0105\u017c armories.\n\nIn the 14th century, a branch of the Prussian family von Runge (originating from an area around Wroclav/Breslau) adopted the surname Sypniewski.\n\nAt the turn of the 16th, and again at the 18th to 19th century, the family split into various and distinct branches, with some members moving to the Austrian province of Galicia (holding the Austrian title Ritter von Odrowaz or Ritter von Sypniewski (see also Ritter) granted by the Empress Maria Theresia), near the Ukraine and Moldavia, then on to Hungary and the Balkans. This Austrian branch produced several k.u.k. officers from the famous Theresian Military Academy in Vienna.\n\nEstates\n\nOne of the earliest recorded Sypniewski's estate transfers is from 1392, when Dobieslaw von Runge (Polish: Dobies\u0142aw Runge) married daughter of Janek from Sypniewo (Polish: Janek z Sypniewa / Janek Sypniewski, German: Johannes von Zippnow) and received Sypniewo (German: Zippnow) in dowry, as well as wedding promise of building first church there (it was completed and expanded in next decades). It is not known when exactly von Runge adopted his wife's family name, but most of their children were already known to use Sypniewski family name.\nSeveral estates called Sypniewo (which means in Polish \"the Sypniewski's Estate\" or \"Sypniewski's town\") still exist today, such as estate south of Samotschin in the former Kreis Chodziesen/Kolmar in Posen, and larger holding called Sypniewo (Zippnow) located north of Samotschin, in Z\u0142ot\u00f3w county. One of their largest estates near Wyrzysk was sold to King Frederick the Great in 1774. Most of Sypniewski's estates were located in former West Prussia, now part of Wielkopolska and Pomorze, Poland.  Wielkopolska, or Greater Poland, is referred to as crib, or home of the Polanie (a Slavic tribe that lived in the heart of Poland, from which name Polska \u2013 Poland \u2013 was later derived ); it also contains some of the oldest towns in today's Poland.\n\nSypniewskis also had estates in Polesie, formerly the largest province of Poland (currently part of Belarus and Ukraine), several near the city of \u017bytomierz (currently under Ukrainian jurisdiction since 1945) and large manorial estate crowned with beautiful palace until the end of the 18th century near the city of Gomel (currently under Belarusian jurisdiction since 1945); only portion of the cellars and some of the foundations in the ground is what remains today from this once wealthy estate, which used to provide living for about 500 peasant families. Politician Jan Odrowaz-Sypniewski was born there around 1760. He was a legate of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth's Great Parliament and one of the promoters of the first in Europe democratic Constitution of May 3, 1791 (and second in the world, after the United States Constitution). His grandson, Dyonizy Odrowaz-Sypniewski, an architect, exiled to United States and U.K., where he published \u2013 at his own expenses \u2013 many treatises and political books regarding Partitions of Poland and advocated for restitution of Poland in general. His avid anti-Russian, anti-Prussian and anti-Austrian activities didn't go well with U.K. government (all 3 countries being allies of British Empire at the time). Once he became persona non grata in Britain and was forced to leave the country, he settled in Brasil, where he built roads and bridges.\nPolesie was inhabited by Ruthenians, called Polesians; of Ukrainian descent. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Sypniewski were found in Polesia as a notable family mentioned in the Listracje (inventories) similar to the registry of England's Domesday Book. The Partitions of Poland and turbulent times of 18th and 19th centuries have forced many Polish families to emigrate to other regions of Europe (particularly Prussia) and later to emigrate further across the Oceans. Among many others: Heinrich Sypniewski from Cologne had a Eucalyptus farm in Brazil; Maria Anna Sypniewski from Bydgodzcz settled in Australia in 1835; Thaddeus Sypniewski landed in Halifax, Nova Scotia, then moved to Pennsylvania in 1850; Heinrich Sypniewski, Colonel of Austrian Empire Army, have been exiled/imprisoned in Siberia after the end of 1863 Polish January Uprising and killed there in 1866 (presumably in Uprising of Polish political exiles in Siberia). Julian Sypniewski tried to establish large farm in United States in 1876 (see California links below).\n\nSypniewskis could also be found near Bydgoszcz (German: Bromberg) and Wroclaw (German: Breslau) in the manor of Skoraszewice until World War II. Others were in Vienna, Passau, Nuremberg, Cologne, Sweden, Switzerland, and \u2013 to a lesser degree \u2013 in other European countries.\n\nList of existing estates\n\n Sypniewski's estate, Sypniewo, Wiecbork County, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, Poland \u2013 A \"Little Palace\", 2010\n Sypniewski's estate; Sypniewo (now part of Poznan city), Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poznan, Poland \u2013 The \"Manor under Plantan Tree\", 2011\n Sypniewski's estate; Sypniewo, Jastrowie County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poland A \"Wayside Chapel\", 2011\n Sypniewski's estate; Sypniewo, Sypniewo County, Masovian Voivodeship, Poland \u2013 bird's eye view of estate, 2007\n Sypniewski's estate; Sypniewo, Margonin County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poland Margonin Lake and parts of estate, 2010\n Sypniewski's estate; Zhytomyr, Zhytomyr Oblast, Ukraine  \u2013 Partially restored old manor, 2006\n Sypniewski's estate, Skoraszewice, Pepowo County, Greater Poland Voivodeship, Poland - almost fully restored palace, 2005\n\nArmorial records \n\nThe Sypniewskis use the Odrow\u0105\u017c clan arms.\n\nNOTE: Polish coats of arms were never provided for individuals or for individual families, but for a much wider group of clans people (a bit like sharing a tartan colour). The Polish nobleman added the name of his clan to the family name. In addition to the adjectival surname ending \"ski\" or \"cki\" meaning 'from' or 'of'. The standard form, for example, was \"Peter Sypniewski, herbu Odrow\u0105\u017c\" or simply \"Piotr Odrow\u0105\u017c Sypniewski\". In this century the surname Sypniewski has been transmuted into the Celtic d'Argantel Odrow\u0105\u017c.\n\nThe book, Galician Nobility, (Galicia was SE Poland as part of the Austrian Empire) lists the arms for Sypniewski (table 449): a family of Polish gentry from the Polish Province (Wojewodztwo) of Prussia, where they are first recorded in 1490. Descendant Boniface Sypniewski is entered in the records of Galicia in 1783. The coat of arms is Odrow\u0105\u017c.\n\nSiebmacher's Wappenbuch (Siebmacher's armorial reference book) under Preussischer Adel (Prussian Nobility), records Sypniewski (table 269), a Polish family, connected to the Odrowaz coat of arms, still 20 years ago (at the printing of the above stated book, c. 1840) in possession of a sizeable piece of farmland. Coat of arms: Look under Gliscinski III (Odrowaz).\n\nOdrow\u0105\u017c Coat of Arms\n\nDescription for the Sypniewski name\n.\n\nArms: Gules, an arrow argent point to chief, the base terminating as inverted horns. \n(Red, a silver arrow, point upwards, the base terminating as inverted horns) \nCrest: out of a crest coronet proper, a pananache of peacock plumes proper, charged with arms, fesseway (horizontally). \nMotto: No motto is recorded\n\n Heraldic Colors:\nArgent: silver and is usually depicted in heraldic painting as white \u2013 or: gold and is usually depicted in heraldic painting as yellow. Gules: red in heraldic language. Red is a royal color. Red/argent stands for bold and resolutely honest with martial prowess, boldness, and valor\n\n Heraldic Symbolism:\nArrows: arrows usually are traced to achievements of the original bearer during the Crusades. Arrows are symbolic of one who is ready and fit for military encounter. \n \nPeacock Feathers: the peacock represents personal pride. Feathers also symbolise conquests in Syria/Holy Land over the Saracens in the Crusades.\n\nDucal Coronet: The four leaves on the coronet surmounting the helmet were originally oak leaves, then changed to the Polish traditional strawberry leaves. Leaves symbolise victorious battle, and/or a title of nobility.\n\nComments\n\nThe Odrow\u0105\u017c arms are also prominently shown in the film Knights of the Teutonic Order (Polish: Krzy\u017cacy), one of the largest film productions ever in Poland, based on the novel of the same name by Nobel prize laureate, Henryk Sienkiewicz.\nKing W\u0142adys\u0142aw Jagie\u0142\u0142o \u2013 a historic person, king of Poland between 1381 and 1434 \u2013 was the first Polish king to recognize Sypniewski's Pomeranian nobility and to bestow them the Odrow\u0105\u017c coat of arms. It was very important event in Sypniewskis history and turning point in their genealogy, as from that moment on vast majority of Sypniewski's clan members were no longer identified as Pomeranian family, but chose to side with, and de facto became Poles. Sypniewski clan provided king Jagie\u0142\u0142o (and later his son, king Casimir IV Jagiellon) with knights, arms, soldiers, supplies and money in their fight against Teutonic Order and they took active part in taking of Bydgoszcz, famous Battle of Grunwald, long Thirteen Years' War, and in every war fought by Poland since (i.e. Rotmistrz (Captain of Cavalry, equivalent of modern Colonel) Jan Stefan Sypniewski had briefly occupied Moscow in 1605 during Polish\u2013Muscovite War)\n\nFeliks Sypniewski was a famous Polish Painter who later emigrated to Paris and is buried at the P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery.\n\nFelicjan Sypniewski was a scientist whose ground-breaking studies and scientific publications influenced the next generations of Polish naturalists and have laid down foundations of malacology and algology.\n\nRenowned sculptor Boles\u0142aw Sypniewski donated almost 2 years of his work for the mausoleum of the most famous leader of Second Polish Republic, Marshal J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski. His Matka i Serce Syna (Mother and Her Son's Heart) black granite tombstone  is still laying there today in Vilnius's Rossa Cemetery in Lithuania (back then part of Poland), where \u2013 in accordance with his wishes \u2013 the heart of Marshal Pi\u0142sudski was buried in his mother's tomb.\n\nSypniewskis have, over the millennium, produced gallant knights, politicians, artists, authors, engineers, officers, musicians, medical doctors, teachers, government administrators, few explorers, and even sportsmen in recent times.\n\nMembers of the Sypniewski family have been actively involved in Polish politics for seven centuries and took part in all Polish wars and uprisings, including Polish Underground Resistance and French Resistance during World War II (i.e. Jan Sypniewski, later known as Jan Slave, journalist at the Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung).\n\nEven though by today many of the families bearing the surname Sypniewski may no longer be classified as being truly 'related', often physical traits are still intact. On the male side they usually are tall, with a high forehead and 'Geheimratsecken' (naturally receded hairline above the temple) with an oval face. Also certain forenames were given within the families and only with the advent of the World Wars was this changed. For example: Jan, Stanislas and Adalbert (or Albert) were very common. It is worthwhile to note that the large parish church in Margonin (near Sypniewo/Chrustowo) is named after Saint Patron of Sypniewski family \u2013 St Adalbert, and it was erected by Sypniewskis at the end of 14th Century.\n\nCalifornia links\n\nAs recounted in her memoirs, the actress Helena Modrzejewska (usually known as Helena Modjeska) emigrated to the United States in 1876. The group of emigrants who settled in Anaheim, California, also included Henryk Sienkiewicz and his good friend Julian Sypniewski, whose Sypniewski family stories and old tell-tales could have been \u2013 or most likely were \u2013 important inspirations for stories later written by Sienkiewicz in his novels. Julian's friend, Stanis\u0142aw Witkiewicz (father of famous Polish poet, writer and painter, Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz) and Adam Chmielowski had planned to be part of this group, but they changed their minds at the last minute.\n\nNotable people\n\n Igor Sypniewski, Polish footballer\n Marian Sypniewski, Polish fencer, Olympic medalist\n Quinn Sypniewski, American football player\n Clarissa Sypniewski, German Actress\n David Sypniewski, USA - world renown snowboarder\n\nSources\n\nNiesiecki, Kasper Herbarz Polski by Kasper Niesiecki, S.

The Mission Revival Style architecture building was designed by San Antonio architect Henry T. Phelps. The building contract was awarded to the Gordon Jones Construction Co. of San Antonio, based on a bid of $65,000. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 30, 1997.\n\nAtascosa County was formed in 1856. The first Atascosa County Courthouse was a log building erected in Amphion in 1856. The second a frame building raised in Pleasanton in 1857. The county built a larger frame courthouse in 1868. The fourth courthouse, built in 1885 was made from red stone and served as the Pleasanton City Hall when the county seat was moved to Jourdanton.\n\nThe current Atascosa County Courthouse is the fifth structure to serve as the seat of Atascosa County government. The Mission Revival style courthouse has towers, balconies and a Spanish-tiled roof. It is finished in red-brown brick and cast stone. Originally, the lower floor was open for the storage of wood. It was enclosed in the late 1920s to create more office space. The courthouse sits on a circular plot of land in contrast to the typical Texas courthouse square.

They have evolved from the single skin metal cladding often associated with agricultural buildings to multi-layer systems for industrial and leisure application. As with most construction components, the ability of the cladding to satisfy its functional requirements is dependent on its correct specification and installation. Also important is its interaction with other elements of the building envelope and structure. Metal profile sheets are metal structural members that due to the fact they can have different profiles, with different heights and different thickness, engineers and architects can use them for a variety of buildings, from a simple industrial building to a high demand design building.  \nTrapezoidal profiles are large metal structural members, which, thanks to the profiling and thickness, retain their high load bearing capability. They have been developed from the corrugated profile. The profile programme offered by specific manufacturers covers a total of approximately 60 profile shapes with different heights.\nCassettes are components that are mainly used as the inner shell in dual-shell wall constructions. They are mainly used in walls today, even though they were originally designed for use in roofs.\n\nHistory \nTrapezoidal profiles and cassettes have been known in Europe for around 100 years. Today's characteristic profile shape came to Europe from the USA in the 50s and has gained relevance since about 1960. At present the proportion of load bearing, room sealing trapezoidal profiles used in the overall area of new and slightly sloping roofs amounts to 90%. Above all else the wide acceptance has resulted from the simple constructive training, fast assembly, and the low costs of the trapezoidal profile construction.\n\nSpecification of the metal profile\n\nWeathertightness \nThe primary function of the cladding system is to provide a weathertight building envelope, suitable for the intended use of the building.\nTrapezoidal metal roof sheets with through fix fasteners are generally suitable for slopes of 4% or steeper. This limit is critical to the performance of the cladding.  For shallower pitches, down to 1.5%, a fix system with no exposed through fasteners, special side laps and preferably no end laps should be used. For low pitch roof, ponding is a potential problem that must be considered at the design stage in order to avoid the deleterious effects of prolonged soaking and the increased loading, due to the weight of the water.\n\nBuilding appearance \nBuilding envelope made from metal sheet provide builders and architects with products, which meet all of the highest demand regarding construction characteristics and design. The steel from which profiled cladding sheets are made is available pre-coated in a wide range of colors and textures, allowing architects to choose a finish that best suits the location and function of the building. Profile shape is also a characteristic that can be adapted to the demand of the architects.\n\nThermal performance \nBuildings are responsible of the 40% of European energy consumption, consequently, improving the thermal performance of the cladding and associated components is very important. The elemental U-value (thermal transmittance, W/m2K) of a cladding panel, depends on the conductivity and thickness of the insulation which is added, the profile shape and the presence of thermal bridges.  \nSo, metal profile sheets can achieve thermal performance regulations thanks of insulations and profile shape.\nIt is very important to analyze and avoid all possible thermal bridges within the roof and wall cladding assembly, to minimize local heat/cold losses.\n\nAcoustics \nRoofs constructed with trapezoidal profiles have excellent sound suppression characteristics. Sound has been found to be reduced to by up to 53\u00a0dB.  \nThe measured sound reduction for wall constructions using cassettes has been assessed at an RW of 57\u00a0dB. \nThe acoustic performance of a particular cladding system will depend on the insulation material, the weather sheet and liner sheet profiles and the method of assembly.\nTo minimize reverberation architects may take advantage of the sound absorbing properties of the cladding insulation layer by replacing the standard liner sheet with a perforated liner.\n\nDurability \nIn order to ensure that the building envelope remains fully functional throughout its design life, it is important that it receives regular maintenance, including inspection, removal of debris, cleaning and repair of damage. Inspection can include man-made or natural wear. Weather exposure, natural movement, installation error and manufacturing defects are examples. The need of maintenance may be greatly reduced using specific coating depending on the weather conditions, this coating guarantee the expected design life of the cladding. The commonly used 302 stainless steel alone is resistant to acetic acid, acetone and boric acid, among others.\n\nSustainability \nMetal profiles sheets have a high recycled scrap steel content and all steel is recyclable.  Many steel components can be unbolted and even reused for future applications.  The possibility of reusing building elements makes steel construction even more sustainable than the already significant contribution of today's simple material recycling.  Steel can be repeatedly recycled because it does not lose any of its inherent physical properties as a result of the recycling process. Stainless steel fasteners have excellent corrosion resistance and durability, as well as being a sustainable material. Custom fasteners in this material make for the utmost of sustainability with high recyclability.\n\nStructural performance \nMetal cladding systems are required to carry externally applied loads, such as snow and wind loading without deflecting excessively or compromising the other performance requirements. The individual characteristic loads (actions) should be obtained from the appropriate part of EN 1991, taking into account the building geometry and location as applicable. These individual actions should then be combined using the appropriate safety factors from EN 1990 to obtain the load cases used in design.\n\nPermanent actions:\nFor most application of metal cladding technology, the only permanent action which the roof cladding needs to be designed is its own self-weight.\nFor wall cladding, it is not normally necessary to consider permanent actions, since the self-weight acts in the plan of the cladding.  \nVariable actions:\nIn addition to its self-weight, the roof cladding must also be designed for the following variable actions as specified in the appropriate parts of EN 1991:\n-Access for cleaning and maintenance. \n-A uniformly distributed load due to snow over the complete roof area. The value of this load will depend on the building's location.\n-Asymmetric snow load and loading due to snow drifts.\n-Wind loading due to pressure and suction. \nDeflections:\nCare must be taken on site to avoid excessive local deflection.  Typical deflection limits imposed on the cladding are depend on the loading regime considered, the location of the structural component and whether a brittle material is present.  Deflection limits may be specifies by National regulation.\n\nMain uses \nMetal profile sheets due to their versatility mechanical and design properties can be used as roof and roof cladding, as external walls and wall cladding and also as floors. They are used in industry and in residential sector, and the two sectors can be used in both new construction and rehabilitation. Some of the applications where metal profile sheets are used are:\nindustrial buildings,\ncommercial buildings,\npublic buildings,\nsport buildings,\neducational buildings,\noffices and administration buildings,\nmulti-story buildings\npower plants,\nresidential house,\nhigh design demand buildings, \netc.\n\nSee also \n Profile (engineering)\n Hollow structural section\n Eurocode\n Insulation\n Architecture\n\nReferences\n\nBuilding engineering\nBuilding insulation materials\nBuilding materials\nComposite materials", "Kone is a volcano located in the Oromia region of Ethiopia. It is located on the Main Ethiopian Rift, which belongs to the most northern branch of the East African Rift Valley. Borchotto the nearest town is 5\u00a0km away and the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa is situated 160\u00a0km west of Kone. The nearest volcano is Mount Fentale located 30\u00a0km to the northwest, with the Boseti Gudo Volcano further away to the southeast.  Kone takes up an area of 250 square miles and has an elevation of 1619m.\n\nHistory of eruptions\nThe complex tectonic history within Ethiopia has made the eruption history difficult to interpret from the Stratigraphic sequence. From the stratigraphy four volcanic sequences of eruption can be determined. Three Silicic phases and then a basalt phase. The most recent basalt phase is dated around 1820. This date corresponds to local legends of the eruption and the lack of vegetation growth on the lava flows provides evidence of this eruption.\n\nGeology\nKone, also called Gariboldi, is made up of seven nested calderas, lava flows and basaltic cinder cones. (Not to be confused with the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt in Northern America.)  There are two fault lines that have caused the volcanic activity within Kone, normal faults, which are part of the Wonji fault belt and ring fractures. The normal faults cause magma to rise inducing the volcanic activity. The ring fractures have caused the calderas collapse. Both of these faults have caused activity within Kone's recent history. The calderas widths can range from 1.5 to 5\u00a0km.\n\nThere are many rock types identified at Kone and they are divided into five main groups, trachytes, comenditic rhyolites, ignimbrites, pumices, syenite inclusions and basalts. Trachytes and comenditic rhyolites form the main volume of the rock in the Complex. The ignimbrites have formed massive green sheets ranging in thickness from 15\u00a0cm to 25\u00a0m. The pumice deposits over the ground are common within Kone's Volcanic Complex and range in thickness from 50\u00a0cm to 20\u00a0m. Most of the pumice is found interlocked with the ignimbrites. There have been three basalt lava types identified at Kone, aphyric basalt, olivine basalt and a third basalt which contains large phenocrysts of olivine,  augite and plagioclase. These different rock types provide evidence for different eruptive phases. Kone is unusual due to the number of calderas in the Volcanic Complex, Fentale contains only one calderas in comparison.\n\nRenaming\n\nKone's name is a recent addition taken from a local tribal word. The historical name of Kone was Gariboldi. Named according to local legend after an engineer who was responsible for building a road through two of the collapsed calderas. Thereby connecting Addis Ababa to Djibouti during the 1940s.\n\nReferences\n\nVolcanoes of Ethiopia\nCalderas of Ethiopia", "Bicycle-friendly policies and practices help some people feel more comfortable about traveling by bicycle with other traffic.  The level of bicycle-friendliness of an environment can be influenced by many factors including town planning and cycling infrastructure decisions. A stigma towards people who ride bicycles and fear of cycling is a social construct that needs to be fully understood when promoting a bicycle friendly culture.\n\nUrban planning\n\nAssuming people prefer to get to their destination quickly, urban planning and zoning may affect whether schools, shops, public transport interchanges and other destination are within a reasonable cycling distance of the areas where people live.  If urban form influences these issues, then compact and circular settlement patterns as in Elizabeth, NJ may promote cycling. Alternatively, the low-density, non-circular (i.e., linear) settlement patterns characteristic of urban sprawl as in nearby downtown Newark tends to discourage cycling.  In 1990, the Dutch adopted the \"ABC\" guidelines, specifically limiting developments that are major attractants to locations that are readily accessible by non-car users.\n\nThe manner in which the public roads network is designed, built and managed can have a significant effect on the utility and safety of cycling as transport. Settlements that provide a dense roads network consisting of interconnected streets will tend to encourage cycling.\n\nIn contrast, other communities may use a cul-de-sac based, housing estate/housing subdivision model where minor roads are disconnected and only feed into a street hierarchy of progressively more \"arterial\" type roads. Designs that propose to resolve the contradiction between the cul-de-sac and the traditional interconnected network, such as the fused grid, have been proposed and built with varying levels of success.\n\nIn the UK, the principle of 'filtered permeability' has been proposed in some government guidance to maximise the ease of movement of cyclists and pedestrians, whilst constraining it for motor vehicles, see permeability.\n\nCycling infrastructure\n\nCycling infrastructure includes bikeways, maps, signs, signals, protected intersections and bicycle parking.\n\nSelection of cycling-friendly infrastructure\n\nBenefits of bicycle-friendly communities\nA community's infrastructure can affect its citizens\u2019 health, especially in regard to obesity and physical activity. Cities that incorporate bicycle routes have a higher percentage of bicycle commuters. Studies have shown that even moderate increases in physical activity can have a substantial effect on health. Bicycling to work has been shown to decrease mortality by as much as 40%.\n\nBicycling is often used as an alternative to travel by car. Automobile travel provides the perception of increased mobility and convenience for travelers, but also has high costs associated with taxes, insurance, fuel, maintenance, road construction and repair, and contributes to air pollution. When infrastructure is built to allow consumers to choose between automobile and other forms of travel, it reduces a community's automobile dependency and allows for more efficient transport choices and land usage.\n\nRecognition\nIn the U.S., the League of American Bicyclists has formally recognized some cities as bicycle-friendly communities for \"providing safe accommodation and facilities for bicyclists and encouraging residents to bike for transportation and recreation.\"\n\nTourism\n\nThe British tourist board award holiday accommodation providers who are cycle friendly with a \"Cycle Friendly\" award.\n\nThe League of American Bicyclists designated New Orleans as a Bicycle Friendly City in 2011.\n\nSee also\n\nCyclability\n\nMikael Colville-Andersen\n Outline of cycling\nPrinciples of intelligent urbanism\nRoad safety\n\nUrban vitality\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nCycling for Everyone: Lessons for Vancouver from the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany (video of lecture by John Pucher)\nWalking, Bicycling and Public Spaces: Experiences from Bogota and Beyond  (video of lecture by Gil Pe\u00f1alosa of Walk and Bike for Life)\n\nLivable Communities Resource Guide\n\nCycling infrastructure", "Intellectual property valuation is a process to determine the monetary value of intellectual property assets. IP valuation is required to be able to sell, license, or enter into commercial arrangements based on IP. It is also beneficial in the enforcement of IP rights, for internal management of IP assets, and for various financial processes.\n\nContext\nIntellectual property assets are part of the non-physical property of a business. They are a sub-set of intangible assets and distinguished from other intangible assets by the fact that they are created by law. As such, IP assets are legally protected and can be legally enforced. These can be independently identified, are transferable and have an economic life (in contrast to their legal life, which is generally longer than their economic life). They include patents, industrial designs, trademarks, copyright, and trade secrets. \n\nIntellectual property derives its value from a wide range of parameters such as usefulness, market share, barriers to entry, legal protection, profitability, industrial and economic factors, growth projections, remaining economic life, and new technologies, all of which will inhere in the valuation. The value of an IP asset essentially comes from the right the owner of that asset has to exclude competitors from using it. For an IP asset to have a quantifiable value it should:\n generate a measurable amount of economic benefits to its owner or authorized user; and\n enhance the value of other assets with which it is associated. Value can be derived through direct exploitation of the IP by integrating it within the product, or sale or licensing of the IP to a third party or other means, such as raising barriers to entry or reducing the threat of substitutes.\n\nAn IP valuation - or economic appraisal -  is prepared, for example, for transactions, merger and acquisition, pricing and strategic purposes, financing securitization and collateralization, tax planning and compliance, and litigation support.\n\nFinally, the information is devoted to be turned into financial models to estimate the fundamental value of a particular type of intellectual property based on such adapted International Valuation Standards.\n Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP)\n International Valuation Standards Committee (IVSC) (50 Countries)\n US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)\n International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)\n Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)\n\nApproaches\n\nIn order to be able sell, license or enter into any commercial arrangements based on IP, the owner need to be able to put a value on an IP asset. IP valuation is also beneficial in the enforcement of IP rights, for internal management of IP assets, and for various financial processes.\n\nThe valuation process necessitates gathering much more information as well as in-depth understanding of economy, industry, and specific business that directly affect the value of the intellectual property. Therefore, such information may be gathered from external and / or internal sources \n\nTo be able to value an IP asset, the asset should meet the following conditions:\n It must be separately identifiable (subject to specific identification and with a recognizable description)\n There should be tangible evidence of the existence of the asset (e.g. a contract, a license, a registration document, record in financial statements, etc.)\n It should have been created at an identifiable point in time.\n It should be capable of being legally enforced and transferred.\n Its income stream should be separately identifiable and isolated from those of other business assets.\n It should be able to be sold independently of other business assets.\n It should be subject to destruction or termination at an identifiable point in time.\n\nThe valuation analysts use numerous approaches in order to reach a reasonable indication of a defined value for the subject intangible assets on a certain date which is referred to as the valuation date. The most common approaches to estimate the fundamental or fair value of the intellectual property are defined as the following:\n \n Income approach: This approach estimates the fair value of intellectual property by discounting the future economic benefits of ownership at an appropriate discount rate. It is the most commonly used method for IP valuation. This method is easiest to use for IP assets with positive cash flows, for those whose cash flows can be estimated with some degree of reliability for future periods, and where a proxy for risk can be used to obtain discount rates.\n Cost approach: The cost approach is based on the economic principle of substitution.  This principle states that an investor will pay no more for an asset than the cost to obtain, by purchasing or constructing, a substitute asset of equal utility. There are several cost approach valuation methods, the most common being the historical cost, replacement cost, and replication cost. The cost method is particularly useful when the IP asset can be easily reproduced and when the economic benefits of the asset cannot be accurately quantified. This method does not account for wasted costs, nor does it consider any unique or novel characteristics of the asset.\n Market approach: The market approach is based on the economic principle of competition and equilibrium. These principles conclude that, in a free and unrestricted market, supply and demand factors will drive the price of an asset at equilibrium point. Furthermore, it provides an indication of the value by comparing the price at which similar property has exchanged between willing buyers and sellers. Data on such similar transactions may be accessed in several public sources, including specialized royalty rate databases. This method has the advantage of being simple and based on market information, so it is often used to establish approximate values for use in determining royalty rates, tax, and inputs for the income method.\nDirect approach: The direct approach is based on the current value of shares of intellectual property in an Intellectual Property (IP) Share Market.\nUsing the pay-off method on top of the four above mentioned methods is a way to enhance the valuation and analysis of intellectual property \n\nRegardless of the method used, the valuation process requires gathering much information about the IP asset, as well as an in-depth understanding of the economy, industry, and specific business that directly affect its value. This information can be obtained by conducting an event-driven IP audit, as well as background research.\n\nSee also\nEconomics and patents\nPatent portfolio\nPatent valuation\nTax amortization benefit\n Intangible asset finance\n\nSources\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Valuing Intellectual Property Assets\n intangible Asset @ Intellectual Property Valuation: a multidisciplinary Perspective\n\nIntellectual property law\nValuation (finance)", "Saint and Greavsie was a British television show in which former footballers Ian St John and Jimmy Greaves discussed current football themes such as the day's matches. It ran on ITV from 1985 to 1992.\n\nFormat\nEnglishman Jimmy Greaves and Scotsman Ian St John were successful football players in the 1960s, but they did not play for the same club; Greaves spent the bulk of his career with Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur, while St John played mainly for Liverpool. Their collaboration as television football pundits started with On the Ball in World of Sport. Usually St John would host from the London studio and would cross over to Greaves, who was elsewhere, to get his views, but they would eventually be based in the same studio. The segment was highly popular, leading to the commissioning of Saint and Greavsie as a programme in its own right immediately after the demise of World of Sport in September 1985. A key characteristic of the show was comedy, with St John prompting Greaves to jokes and jibes.\n\nThe show was usually about 30 minutes long and was initially broadcast shortly after noon on Saturdays, to coincide with the build-up to that afternoon's football matches. In later years it usually went on air shortly after 1pm and in its final season was increased in length to a 45-minute slot. At various points in the show the goals of previous matches would be shown. The show included features on clubs in both English and Scottish leagues and discussion of that weekend's major games, emphasising matches that ITV planned to broadcast.\n\nThe series initially had a simple opening sequence showing a rotating rudimentary CGI-image of a football pitch revolving several times, before a still of the two presenters popped up at the end; the theme tune was initially identical to that used for the \"On the Ball\" segment of 'World of Sport. In later years, the introduction to the show began with St John and Greaves as cigarette cards from their playing days on the opening credits, and the theme tune was changed to a piece named \"Aztec Gold\", composed by Silsoe, which, at the time, was being used as the theme tune for ITV's The Big Match, after being the theme tune for the station's coverage of the 1986 World Cup.\n\nAlthough the show predominantly dealt with football, it also covered sports such as cricket and boxing, with interviewees including Mike Tyson and Chris Eubank. When Greaves was ill at Christmas 1990, he was replaced by commentator Peter Brackley voicing a puppet modelled on him from Spitting Image, a show he had often featured on.\n\nIn the 1991\u201392 season, the Rumbelows Cup draw was broadcast on Saint and Greavsie. The away teams for the quarter-finals were drawn by future USA president Donald Trump, when the duo were in the United States to film a programme looking at how the country was preparing for the 1994 FIFA World Cup.\n\nGoal of the Season\nAfter ITV secured the rights to show league football, the network had their own Goal of the Season award (the BBC had the rights to FA Cup matches, so their award always went to the winning goal in the FA Cup final). Every First Division club were eligible, with the best goal from each respective season chosen by the club's manager. The next week, the list was cut down to six, with the general public able to send their top three goals in order. The goal with the most votes was the winner.\n\nIn the final series, the twenty nominations were chosen by the Saint and Greavsie team, as more than one goal scored by Manchester United and Arsenal players were chosen. Goals from Second Division clubs were also included.\n\nEnd of an era\nIn the summer of 1992, ITV lost the rights to broadcast top-tier English football matches as the newly formed Premier League contracted to Sky Sports. ITV then discontinued Saint and Greavsie. The final programmes were broadcast from Sweden during Euro 92, with the pair singing \"The Last Time\" in the final credits and making jokes at Sky's expense.\n\nAside from a 1995 series Saint and Greavsie's World of Sport, the pair did not present under the name Saint and Greavsie again, but continued to link up together and remained in touch. They occasionally presented Champions League preview shows together and both remained employed by ITV for several years. Together, they hosted the discussion show Sport in Question. St John continued to be used as a co-commentator for the ITV network until the arrival of Jim Beglin, while Greaves continued to appear as a pundit and co-commentator in the Central region until 1996, when he was gradually phased out in favour of Ron Atkinson. Away from their work, Greaves and St John rarely met due to living in Essex and on the Wirral respectively, but Greaves said they had a \"lovely relationship\".\n\nIn 2004, Saint and Greavsie were studio guests in an episode of Fantasy Football League, when they were described as the \"godfathers\" of football comedy by Frank Skinner and David Baddiel. In earlier years they had been parodied in sketches on the show. St John criticised Baddiel and Skinner in his autobiography and interviews, following their appearance on the show.\n\nOther formats\nIn 1989, Grandslam Entertainment released Saint and Greavsie, a football trivia quiz game, on a variety of computer platforms. It was developed by Core Design. In 2006, Saint and Greavsie released a DVD quiz, featuring retro football action, with a book, Saint and Greavsie's Funny Old Games, having also since been published.\n\nIn May 2009, Setanta Sports announced that Saint and Greavsie were reforming their double act to star in a FA Cup Special on 30 May, the day of the Cup Final. The Saint and Greavsie FA Cup Special was broken up into three separate mini-programmes appearing throughout the build up to the Everton v Chelsea final.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1980s British sports television series\n1985 British television series debuts\n1990s British sports television series\n1992 British television series endings\nEnglish Football League on television\nEnglish-language television shows\nITV Sport\nLondon Weekend Television shows\nTelevision series by ITV Studios", "The 140th New York State Legislature, consisting of the New York State Senate and the New York State Assembly, met from January 3 to October 2, 1917, during the third year of Charles S. Whitman's governorship, in Albany.\n\nBackground\nUnder the provisions of the New York Constitution of 1894, re-apportioned in 1906 and 1907, 51 Senators and 150 assemblymen were elected in single-seat districts; senators for a two-year term, assemblymen for a one-year term. The senatorial districts were made up of entire counties, except New York County (twelve districts), Kings County (eight districts), Erie County (three districts) and Monroe County (two districts). The Assembly districts were made up of contiguous area, all within the same county.\n\nAt this time there were two major political parties: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. The Socialist Party, the Prohibition Party, the Progressive Party, the Independence League, the Socialist Labor Party and the American Party also nominated tickets.\n\nElections\nThe New York state election, 1916, was held on November 7. Charles S. Whitman and Edward Schoeneck were re-elected Governor and Lieutenant Governor; both Republicans. The other eight statewide elective offices were also carried by Republicans. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for Governor, was: Republicans 836,000; Democrats 687,000; Socialists 63,000; Prohibition 22,000; Progressives 7,000; Independence League 5,000; Socialist Labor 4,000; and American 2,000.\n\nSessions\nThe Legislature met for the regular session at the State Capitol in Albany on January 3, 1917; and adjourned on May 10.\n\nThaddeus C. Sweet (R) was re-elected Speaker.\n\nElon R. Brown (R) was re-elected Temporary President of the State Senate.\n\nThe Legislature redistricted the Senate seats, and re-apportioned the number of assemblymen per county. Bronx County\u2014which had been part of New York County at the time of the previous apportionment and occupied roughly the area of four Assembly districts\u2014was properly separated, and was apportioned eight seats. New York County (without the Bronx) lost eight seats; and Erie, Jefferson and Ulster counties lost one seat each. Queens County gained two seats; and Broome, Nassau, Richmond, Schenectady and Westchester counties gained one seat each.\n\nThe Legislature met for a special session at the State Capitol in Albany on July 31, 1917. This session was called to enact food control legislation, which would regulate the seizure and shipping of food to the Allies in Europe, helping them with their war effort against Germany during World War I.\n\nOn August 24, the Food Control Bill was passed by the Legislature. The bill established a three-member Food Control Commission. The Legislature took a recess until September 6.\n\nOn September 7, the State Senate rejected the nomination of George Walbridge Perkins as Chairman of the Food Control Commission, and took a recess until September 25.\n\nOn October 2, the State Senate rejected again the nomination of Perkins; and then confirmed the appointment of John Mitchell, Jacob Gould Schurman and Charles A.

She made her Broadway debut in the musical Jekyll & Hyde, originating the role of Lucy Harris, for which she was nominated for the Drama Desk Award. Eder has performed in concert halls across the country including Carnegie Hall and Radio City Musical Hall. She has released her 18th solo album in 2018.\n\nBiography\n\nEder was born in Tucson, Arizona, on February 3, 1961, and raised in Brainerd, Minnesota. Her parents,  Georg (from Austria) and Laila (from Norway), exposed her to music at an early age. She cites Judy Garland, Barbra Streisand, and Eileen Farrell as her childhood inspiration. Eder cites Garland, specifically, as her greatest influence. Her first musical theater credit was as the Mother Abbess in a high school production The Sound of Music. Eder was 4th runner up in the 1980 Miss Minnesota Pageant.\n\nBefore her work on Broadway, Eder sang in clubs in Minneapolis and performed at Harrah's Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. In 1988 she won the talent show Star Search, where her performance caught the notice of Frank Wildhorn. She signed with RCA Records and starred in two 1991 stagings of Wildhorn's musical Svengali (the 1990 world premiere and 1995\u201396 national tour), the 1997 Broadway production of his Jekyll & Hyde, and the 2003 World Premiere of Camille Claudel. During those years, Eder recorded several CDs on Angel Records and Atlantic Records.  Wildhorn and Eder married in 1998  and divorced in 2004; they have one son, Jake. Eder won the Theater World Award (1996\u201397) for Best Broadway Debut in Jekyll & Hyde.\n\nAfter her first solo concert at New York's famous Carnegie Hall she caught the attention of two talk show hosts who were in the audience that night: Rosie O'Donnell and Kathie Lee Gifford. She subsequently appeared on The Rosie O'Donnell Show and Live with Regis and Kathie Lee and the Late Show with David Letterman. She was invited to Gifford's final performance on Live... and sang the song \"Anything Can Happen\", which was written for the musical Wonderland: Alice's New Musical Adventure,\n\nBroadway\nEder's major theatrical career began in 1987, when she auditioned in Florida in front of musical theater composer Frank Wildhorn for the leading role of Lucy in Jekyll & Hyde. Very impressed with her vocal skills, she was immediately cast, although no production was planned at that time.  Linda has also performed holiday concerts on Broadway at The Palace and Gershwin theaters.\n\nJekyll & Hyde\nIn 1990, the Alley Theatre in Houston agreed to host the world premiere of Jekyll & Hyde, the first musical ever performed there. The show was extended several times, and Eder received raves for her performance. Following this triumph, Wildhorn debuted the musical Svengali, starring his two leading performers from Jekyll: Linda and Chuck Wagner. The musical also eventually played at the Asolo Theatre in Sarasota, Florida in 1991. She then performed with several workshops for The Scarlet Pimpernel, as the leading lady Marguerite St. Just, as well as appearing on the concept recording.\n\nIn 1995, after several workshops with Jekyll & Hyde, she was once again Lucy; Robert Cuccioli and Christiane Noll starred opposite her. The show remounted at the Theatre Under the Stars in Houston, before moving to Seattle's 5th Avenue Theatre. Following these two successful runs, Eder's headlining stint as Lucy traveled across the nation from Fall 1995 until Spring 1996, with a hopeful Broadway mounting in Spring 1996. However, the show was delayed.\n\nFinally beginning previews the following March 1997, new creative team members joined. Along with the transfer came the dismissal of Lucy's first big number, \"Bring on the Men\". Although several rumors have circulated as to why it was cut, Eder has said that it was director/choreographer/scenic designer Robin Phillips who cut the song, which was not only one of her favorite songs, but a fan favorite as well. She has, however, given him some praise, mostly due to the acting coaching he gave her.\n\nIn 1997, she was nominated for the Drama Desk Award and Outer Critics Circle Award and won the Theatre World Award for her debut performance. Television personalities such as Regis Philbin and Rosie O'Donnell considered Eder robbed of a Tony Award nomination, both of whom had featured her (and Frank Wildhorn and his other musicals) on their respective shows several times. Eder was married to Wildhorn whilst performing on Broadway, and officially left on August 30, 1998. Luba Mason replaced her.  Eder left Jekyll to start a family but agreed to be cast in the limited run of the world premiere of Wildhorn's musical tapestry, The Civil War for its Houston premiere.\n\nEder performed for several workshops and demo recordings for Wildhorn. Most importantly, she did several tracks for his Wonderland: Alice's New Musical Adventure (previously called Alice), which had its world premiere ten years after the first single (\"Anything Can Happen\") was released, Havana (for which she has released the title song and several others), Bonnie & Clyde: A New Musical (which was to recently star Brandi Burkhardt, but now Laura Osnes, having its world premiere in 2009), Dracula, the Musical as Mina, Cyrano de Bergerac - The musical as Roxanne (opposite Douglas Sills in the title role), and finally Camille Claudel, which was written for her, and she was able to perform at two runs.\n\nEder's next musical outing was in Camille Claudel in 2003. She performed the role at the Goodspeed Opera House. Although the show, presented in an entire chamber-style form, received mixed reviews, Eder gained much attention again. In 2004, it was performed at the New York Musical Theatre Festival. However, the show has yet to be produced on a major scale, although several European productions were planned and an eventual Japanese premiere in 2011.\n\nThe Other Side of Me\n\nReleased on September 30, 2008, her CD The Other Side of Me has a pop/country feel. This is a departure from the style she is known for, which is standards and ballads. Her official website has a posting where Eder says \"It took a year and a half to make my new CD, the other side of me, but in reality, it has been a lifetime in the making.\"\n\nShe goes on to say:\n\nNow\nAt a \"Frank Wildhorn & Friends\" concert in Vienna in 2010, Eder appeared with Wildhorn, and European musical theatre superstars Pia Douwes and Thomas Borchert to celebrate the music of Wildhorn. The two shared a song, \"Living in the Shadows.\" Eder performed several numbers including \"Vienna\", a fitting ending to the concert.  A live audio recording was released of the concert, but a planned DVD release was put on hold.\n\nIn 2011, Eder reunited with former record producer and musical arranger Jeremy Roberts and Wildhorn to work on two pieces. First, on the musical Tears of Heaven, which was produced in South Korea.\n\nAlso in 2011, Eder debuted her first Wildhorn-composed solo album since 2003, entitled Now. The recording received much acclaim and featured the single \"Now\" as well as a blend of pop songs and musical selections, such as \"The Mad Hatter\" (from Wonderland), \"What's Never Been Done Before\" (Camille Claudel), and \"Living in the Shadows\" (Victor/Victoria), which was originally written for Julie Andrews in the Broadway production of that musical.\n\nIn 2013 Eder recorded her 15th solo CD, a holiday themed album called Christmas Where You Are, which features a duet with her son Jake, then 14 years old. She adapted the lyrics to make it a personal and humorous mother and son duet.\n\nShe is becoming increasingly sought after for her successful Master Classes and vocal lessons.\n\nHer concert schedule continues to take her across the country. In 2013 she performed a series of concerts entitled Memory Lane, incorporating key songs from her earliest performing days to the present.\n\nLinda Live - The Live Concert Recording\nOn June 21, 2014, Eder performed a concert at the Arthur Zankel Music Center on the campus of Skidmore College.  This performance was recorded and will become Eder's  15th solo album. The concert was performed to a crowd of nearly 500 people and contained Eder's signature songs which include, \"Someone Like You\" from Jekyll & Hyde, \"Vienna\" and \"Man of La Mancha.\"  Other songs performed that evening were all songs Eder said she performed throughout her career, including \"I'm Not Lisa,\" \"I Dreamed a Dream\" from Les Miserables, \"Fernando\" (by ABBA), \"Don\u2019t Cry for Me Argentina\" from Evita and \"Climb Ev\u2019ry Mountain\" from the only musical Eder said she performed in high school, The Sound of Music.  Linda Live was released on September 9, 2014 and is sold exclusively on Eder's website.\n\nPersonal life  \n\nLinda Eder married Frank Wildhorn on May 3, 1998. They have a son, Jake, born in 1999. They separated in fall 2003 and divorced in 2004.\n\nNotable Theatre Roles\n\nDiscography\n\nSolo albums\n 1989 Vienna (Early UK release of the Linda Eder album)\n 1991 Linda Eder\n 1994 And So Much More\n 1997 It's Time\n 1999 It's No Secret Anymore\n 2000 Christmas Stays the Same\n 2002 Gold\n 2003 Storybook\n 2003 Broadway, My Way\n 2005 By Myself: The Songs of Judy Garland\n 2007 Greatest Hits\n 2008 The Other Side of Me\n 2009 Soundtrack\n 2011 Now\n 2013 Christmas Where You Are\n 2014 Linda Live: The Concert Recording\n 2015 Retro\n 2018 If You See Me\n 2020 Retro-Volume Two\n\nMusical albums\n 1990 Jekyll & Hyde: Romantic Highlights (Concept Album) - Lucy Harris & Lisa Carew\n 1992 The Scarlet Pimpernel (Concept Recording) - Marguerite St. Just\n 1995 Jekyll & Hyde: The Complete Work (Concept Album) - Lucy Harris\n 1997 Jekyll & Hyde - The Musical: Original Broadway Cast - Lucy Harris\n 1998 The Scarlet Pimpernel: Encore!

It was the fifth election held in South Africa under conditions of universal adult suffrage since the end of the apartheid era in 1994, and also the first held since the death of Nelson Mandela. It was also the first time that South African expatriates were allowed to vote in a South African national election.\n\nThe National Assembly election was won by the African National Congress (ANC), but with a reduced majority of 62.1%, down from 65.9% in the 2009 election. The official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) increased its share of the vote from 16.7% to 22.2%, while the newly formed Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) obtained 6.4% of the vote.\n\nEight of the nine provincial legislatures were won by the ANC. The EFF obtained over 10% of the vote in Gauteng, Limpopo and North West, and beat the DA to second place in the last two. In the other six provinces won by the ANC, the DA obtained second place. This included KwaZulu-Natal, where the DA for the first time beat the Inkatha Freedom Party to second place. In the Western Cape, the only province not won by the ANC, the DA increased its majority from 51.5% to 59.4%.\n\nElectoral system\nSouth Africa has a parliamentary system of government; the National Assembly consists of 400 members elected by proportional representation with a closed list approach. Two hundred members are elected from national party lists; the other 200 are elected from provincial party lists in each of the nine provinces. The President of South Africa was chosen by the National Assembly after the election.\n\nThe provincial legislatures, which vary in size from 30 to 80 members, are also elected by proportional representation with closed lists. The premiers of each province will be chosen by the winning majority in each provincial legislature.\n\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) consists of 90 members, ten elected by each provincial legislature. The NCOP members will be elected by the provincial legislatures in proportion to the party makeup of the legislatures.\n\nChanges to electoral legislation \nOn 26 November 2013 the Electoral Amendment Act, 2013, came into force. It allows South African citizens resident outside South Africa to register and vote in the election of the National Assembly.\n\nA new regulation added in 2013 that was enforced for the first time on 7 May 2014 is the prohibition of photographing marked ballot papers, which aims to inhibit voter intimidation.\n\nPolitical parties\n\nThe governing African National Congress (ANC), supported by its Tripartite Alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party (SACP), have held a majority of the seats in the National Assembly since 1994. They were re-elected with increasing majorities in 1999 and 2004, and with a slight fall in its majority from 69% to 65.9% in 2009. The ANC is led by Jacob Zuma. In 2012, Zuma was re-elected to a second five-year term as President of the African National Congress, beating his only rival and deputy, Kgalema Motlanthe, by a wide margin. Cyril Ramaphosa was elected as Deputy President of the ANC, succeeding Motlanthe who had declined a second term after losing to Zuma.\n\nThe official opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) received 16.7% of the vote in 2009, up from 12.4% in 2004. The DA is led by Helen Zille, who was re-elected unopposed as Leader of the Democratic Alliance at the party's Federal Congress in Gauteng in 2012, while Lindiwe Mazibuko continued as Leader of the Opposition in Parliament. At provincial level, the DA has been in power in the Western Cape province since 2009, and came to power in several Western Cape municipalities in the 2011 municipal election. Traditionally, the DA was seen as a party rallying against apartheid laws, especially in the 1980s. However, one of its larger following bases are the whites in the south, especially after it absorbed the New National Party in 2001 (although NNP was disbanded in 2004).\n\nCongress of the People (COPE), is led by Mosiuoa Lekota, although the leadership is disputed by Mbhazima Shilowa who continues to battle for recognition in the High Court. The party has been riven by infighting, causing it to lose much of its support and resulting in the formation of a splinter group, the United Congress. COPE won three seats in the National Assembly in the 2014 elections.\n\nMangosuthu Buthelezi remains leader of the Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) despite a challenge by former IFP chairperson Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi, who formed the National Freedom Party (NFP) after her feud with Buthelezi. The NFP and IFP split the vote in the Zulu-dominated KwaZulu-Natal province in the previous local government elections, each getting an even share of the vote, while the ANC continued to dominate the former IFP stronghold.\n\nThe Electoral Commission of South Africa (IEC) announced on 17 March that a record number of 33 parties had registered candidates for the national parliamentary election. In the provincial legislature elections the number of parties registering candidates, including four parties which had not yet paid the required deposits subject to a 24 March deadline, were:\nWestern Cape \u2013 26\nGauteng \u2013 22\nLimpopo \u2013 20\nEastern Cape \u2013 18\nKwaZulu-Natal \u2013 18\nFree State \u2013 17\nMpumalanga \u2013 16\nNorthern Cape \u2013 16\nNorth West \u2013 16\n\nThe electoral code of conduct was signed in Midrand, Gauteng on 19 March 2014. At the signing event, a draw was held in which the Freedom Front Plus won the right to appear at the top of the ballot paper.\n\nNew parties\nSeveral parties contested the election for the first time and gained seats nationally and provincially:\n\nExpelled former ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema launched the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), taking a strong anti-ANC position within its ultra-left economic platform, such as calling for the expropriation of land without compensation and the nationalisation of South Africa's mines and the South African Reserve Bank. EFF won 25 seats in the assembly in the 2014 elections, taking the lead over older parties including COPE, FF+, and UDM.\nThe National Freedom Party (NFP) was formed by former IFP chairperson Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi.\nThe African Independent Congress contested the election nationally for the first time.\nAgang South Africa was formed by anti-apartheid movement leader Mamphela Ramphele in 2013.\n\nOther new parties were formed but did not obtain seats nationally:\n\nThe Ubuntu Party is a South African political party founded by Michael Tellinger based on his principles of Ubuntu Contributionism. The party aims to introduce 100% employment by closing down the South African Reserve Bank and replacing it with a People's Bank that will grant interest-free home loans, fund massive public works campaign, and provide free electricity as Eskom is owned by the people of South Africa.\nThe Workers and Socialist Party (WASP) was launched on Human Rights Day 2013 by leaders of the independent mineworkers' strike committees that led the strikes in the mining industry in 2012, before and after the Marikana massacre, and the Democratic Socialist Movement (DSM).\nAs a result of the infighting in COPE, the United Congress splinter group was formed, led by Mluleki George.\nThe new right-wing Front National (FN) party formed in December 2013 promotes separatism and Afrikaner self-determination. Hannes Engelbrecht is their leader and Dan Roodt is their deputy leader and spokesperson.\nThe Patriotic Alliance was formed in 2013 by South African businessman, Kenny Kunene, and Kunene's former jail-mate, Gayton Mckenzie.\n\nAlliances and defections\nThe Independent Democrats party, which won four seats and 0.9% of the national vote in 2009, merged with the Democratic Alliance before the 2014 general election.\n\nOn 17 December 2013, the South African Press Association reported that five opposition parties, namely COPE, the IFP, the African Christian Democratic Party, the United Christian Democratic Party and the Freedom Front Plus, had formed a coalition with 20 specific priorities. The parties in the coalition, named the Collective for Democracy (CD) and chaired by COPE leader Mosiuoa Lekota, will retain their own identity and contest the election individually. The IFP denied being part of the coalition, saying they were wary of forming such alliances given the confusion it had caused for their supporters in previous elections. Three days later, the 20th, COSATU's largest affiliate National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (NUMSA) announced that they would not endorse the ANC or any other political party in 2014. NUMSA planned to establish a new working class collective along the lines of the defunct United Democratic Front, with the ultimate goal of forming a socialist party that will contest the 2019 general election. An opposing COSATU faction has obtained a legal opinion on removing NUMSA from COSATU, with significant implications for the country's labour and political landscape.\n\nOn 28 January 2014, the DA announced that Mamphela Ramphele had accepted an invitation to stand as its presidential candidate in the 2014 general election, and the DA and Agang South Africa were set to merge. On the 31st, Ramphele stated that she would not take up DA party membership and would remain the leader of Agang South Africa, resulting in confusion. On 2 February, Helen Zille stated that Ramphele had reneged on her agreement to stand as the DA's presidential candidate. Ramphele subsequently apologised for the reversal of her decision, saying that the timing was not right as the reaction to it had shown people were unable to overcome race-based party politics.\n\nOn 6 February, it was reported that COPE members who support Mbhazima Shilowa's planned to join the United Democratic Movement led by Bantu Holomisa which won four seats in the 2009 election. On 10 March, it was reported that COPE MP Nqaba Bhangu had joined the DA as an Eastern Cape parliamentary candidate, and three COPE MPs, namely Julie Kilian, Leonard Ramatlakane and Nick Koornhof were included on the ANC's list of national parliamentary candidates published on the 11th. On 28 April, it was reported that over 20 COPE MPs had defected to the ANC citing \"poor political leadership\". The only COPE member in the KwaZulu-Natal Legislature, Lucky Gabela, subsequently also defected to the ANC citing internal conflict.\n\nOn 11 March, Al Jama-ah and the Africa Muslim Party announced they would campaign together under the Al Jama-ah Community Party banner. The next day, it was reported that DA MP Beverley Abrahams had joined the ANC. On the 17th, Economic Freedom Fighters announced agreement to establish working relations with the Socialist Party of Azania (SOPA) and Black Consciousness Party (BCP), who would not independently stand for elections, but their candidates would be part of the EFF election 2014 candidates list as EFF members. EFF also had members of South Africa First (SAF) in the list who hold dual membership. Although SAF had not agreed to them being on the EFF list, its leadership collective endorsed the lists.\n\nOn the 20th, it was reported that DA MPs Lourie Bosman, Niekie van den Berg and Theo Coetzee were joining Freedom Front Plus on the party's national candidates list for the 2014 election. On the 30th, it was reported in the Sunday Times that DA MP Mpowele Swathe had joined the United Christian Democratic Party (UCDP) after his name appeared on election candidate lists for both parties.\n\nEndorsements\nOn 2 May 2014, the Mail & Guardian newspaper \"urged readers to oppose the ANC\" for the first time, to dilute the ruling party's \"overweening political power\". The editorial cited the support of Cabinet ministers for the controversial proposed \"secrecy law\" and the ANC's \"cynical response to the Nkandla scandal\" among its reasons. A Financial Mail editorial published on the same day, cited unemployment and changes in the government's administration and policies which impacted business negatively. It stated \"the ANC does not get our endorsement this time\" and \"our vote goes to the DA\". An editorial published in The Economist the following day, cited unemployment and an increase in corruption under Zuma's leadership in particular and stated that the ANC and Zuma \"no longer deserve to rule\" and \"The DA deserves to be endorsed.\" Also on the 2nd, Abahlali baseMjondolo, a social movement representing shack dwellers which previously supported the No Land! No House! No Vote! election boycott campaign, announced its provincial endorsement of the DA in KwaZulu-Natal for the election as a tactical vote against the ANC.\n\nVoter registration\n\nLocal voters\nOn the weekends of 9\u201310 November 2013 and 8\u20139 February 2014 all voting stations were opened for new voters to register and for those who moved residence to re-register in their new voting district. The presidency of South Africa urged voters who had missed the voting station registration weekends to register at an IEC office during office hours. Presidential spokesperson, Mac Maharaj, said that voters were allowed to register to vote until the election date is published in a government gazette, after which the voters' roll is closed. Approximately 5.5 million people in total visited voting stations, including between 1 and 2 million new voters. This increased the number of registered voters to 25.3 million, representing 80.5% of the 31.4 million people eligible to vote in the country. South Africans who were born after the 1994 general election, known as the born-free generation, and are aged 18 or older were eligible to vote for the first time.\n\nInternational voters\nSouth Africans living abroad could register to vote at any South African Embassy, High Commission or Consulate-General from 9 January 2014 to 7 February 2014. South Africans living abroad who wished to vote had to notify the IEC of their intention to vote by 12 March 2014. The weekends of 18\u201319 January and 25\u201326 January were made registration weekends to accommodate voters who were unable to register during business hours. Over 26,000 voters were registered to vote abroad by the time of the election.\n\nA total of 26,701 voters were registered to vote abroad, with the highest numbers of voters being registered to vote in London (9,863), Dubai (1,539) and Canberra (1,243) with other stations totalling 14,056 registered voters.\n\nOpinion polling\n\nNational ballot\n\nAccording to an internal poll conducted by the DA with American pollster Stan Greenberg in March\u2013April 2014, the ANC would get 59% of the vote, the DA 26% and the EFF 8%.\n\nIn an Ipsos survey of 1,000 registered ANC members conducted for the Sunday Times in December 2013, 55% of respondents said they will vote for the ANC again, 5% said they will vote for the DA, 6% said they will vote for other parties, and the remaining 34% said they did not know or preferred not to answer.\n\nAccording to the results of an Ipsos Pulse of the People survey published in February 2014, the DA is the most multi-racial party while the ANC has 96% black supporters and the EFF has 99% black supporters, relative to 76% black survey respondents. The age profile of ANC supporters closely resembles the age profile of voters, while DA supporters are slightly older overall and EFF supporters are significantly younger overall.\n\nAfrica Check, a non-profit organisation that checks facts in claims made about Africa, and the Centre for the Study of Democracy have criticised polls by market research companies as unscientific. Africa Check warned that some polls are intentionally misleading and some are essentially conjecture.\n\nProvincial ballot\nThe Ipsos Pulse of the People survey undertaken in October and November 2013 showed that a number of provinces would be closely contested. The ANC will continue to dominate in the Eastern Cape, Limpopo, North West, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Free State. The DA will keep the Western Cape while control of the Northern Cape and Gauteng will be contested between the ANC and DA, with other parties holding the balance of power, so coalitions may be decisive. In Limpopo and North West the EFF could become the official opposition.\n\nThe Ipsos/Sunday Times survey undertaken in February and March 2014 showed that the ANC enjoyed majority support in all provinces except the Western Cape, where the DA retains majority support. DA support followed that of the ANC in all other provinces except for the North West, where the EFF came in second place.\n\nCampaign\n\nDebates\nThe South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) broadcast weekly election debates from February to May 2014. They were broadcast between 6pm and 7pm on SABC 1 and streamed live on the SABC's YouTube channel.\n\nThe following debates took place:\n\nControversies\nIn January 2014, Helen Zille announced that the DA would be marching to Luthuli House, the ANC's headquarters, saying, \"We are taking the fight to Luthuli House to highlight the failure of (President) Jacob Zuma's ANC to cut corruption and create jobs\". Zille said that 6000 people would be marching, each one representing 1000 South Africans who would benefit from the 6 million jobs that the DA promised to create if it came to power. The planned date of the march was 4 February 2014, but this was later changed to the 12th due to logistical problems. The Johannesburg Metro Police Department (JMPD) initially denied the DA's application to march but the decision was overturned on 3 February 2014 when the DA took the matter to the Johannesburg High Court. On the 11th, it was reported that the JMPD had set the march perimeters to prevent the DA from marching to Luthuli House. JMPD spokesperson, Chief Superintendent Wayne Minnaar said, \"The protest march by the DA... has been prohibited on the grounds that there would be a security risk to protesters.\" The DA announced that the march would now end at Beyers Naude Square. On the day of the march, an application to stop the DA march filed by the ANC to the South Gauteng High Court was dismissed.\n\nThe march ended early after the DA was confronted by ANC supporters 40 minutes into the march. Stones and petrol bombs were thrown by ANC supporters at police trying to calm the situation.\n \n\nOn 13 March, violence erupted in the Bekkersdal township in Gauteng, the scene of violent service delivery protests in 2013. Residents staged a protest over a planned ANC campaign in the area, barricading the streets with rocks and burning tyres and pelting ANC officials and police vehicles with stones. Police responded to the volatile situation by firing rubber bullets at residents.\n\nShortly after Public Protector Thuli Madonsela's final report on security upgrades to President Jacob Zuma's private residence at Nkandla was published on 19 March, the DA sent a bulk text message to Gauteng voters which reads: \"The Nkandla report shows how Zuma stole your money to build his R246m home. Vote DA on 7 May to beat corruption. Together for change.\" The ANC submitted an urgent application to the South Gauteng High Court to stop distribution of the text message on the grounds that it violated the Electoral Act. On 4 April, the court ruled that the wording of the message was fair comment and dismissed the ANC's application with costs. The ANC was granted leave to appeal the decision. On 6 May, the Electoral Court ruled that the DA must retract the text message, finding that it wrongly targeted Zuma personally instead of the systematic failures highlighted in Madonsela's report. The court case was ultimately won by the DA when the Constitutional Court set aside the Electoral Court ruling on 19 January 2015.\n\nOn 5 April, a marquee, a stage, a sound system and chairs set up for an EFF rally in Thokoza were petrol bombed in the early hours of the morning. EFF spokesperson, Mbuyiseni Mdlozi said that the EFF suspected ANC members were responsible for the sabotage. ANC spokesperson Jackson Mthembu denied the allegations, saying \"We don't do such things.\"\n\nThe following day, the DA accused the ANC of abusing state resources after the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) was seen giving out blankets and toiletries at an ANC rally in Parys. ANC spokesperson Khusela Sangoni-Khawe denied the accusation, saying that the ANC did not know SASSA would be at the rally.\n \nFour days later, the DA submitted a complaint to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) about censorship by the public broadcaster after the SABC informed the DA it would not continue broadcasting a DA television advert titled \"ANC Ayisafani\", meaning \"the ANC's not the same\", and five DA radio adverts aired on 8 and 9 April 2014. According to the DA's Mmusi Maimane, who appears in the television advert, the SABC banned all DA adverts from 11 public radio stations as well as the television advert. ICASA announced that it would hold public hearings on the matter on Thursday the 17th, 6 days after the DA lodged their complaint. Following the DA's announcement that it would submit an urgent application to the South Gauteng High Court requesting a ruling on the adverts before the long Easter weekend commencing Good Friday, the day after ICASA's proposed public hearing date, the ICASA hearings commenced 2 days earlier than originally scheduled. On the day after the hearing, the ban was lifted temporarily as the SABC had failed to provide reasons for the ban during the ICASA hearings and requested more time to prepare a response. The DA also objected to the SABC not allowing the national official opposition party to participate in a televised election debate on land reform on SABC in the first 2 weeks of April. On 25 April, ICASA upheld the SABC's ban on the television advert finding that it contravened ICASA's regulations on party election broadcasts. ICASA ordered that a photograph taken by The Citizen photographer Alaister Russell of a police officer firing rubber bullets at unarmed residents during the March 2014 Bekkersdal protest be removed from the advert as \"the police should not be seen as a threat to the community\". In the advert, Maimane says \"We've seen a police force killing our own people\" while the photograph is shown on the screen. The South African Police Service had earlier submitted a complaint to ICASA that this footage would incite violence against police officers.\n\nOn 15 April 2014, a protest campaign against corruption with the slogan \"Vukani! Sidikwe! (Wake up! We are Fed up!) Vote No\", supported by over 100 ANC veterans, was launched by former government ministers Ronnie Kasrils and Nozizwe Madlala-Routledge. The IEC has requested a legal opinion on whether the campaign contravenes the Electoral Act. The campaign urges ANC supporters to either spoil their votes or vote for a smaller party. Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu welcomed the campaign, and human rights activist and cleric Barney Pityana describes it as \"a campaign to bring rationality, order, morality and decency back into our electoral system\" in a Mail & Guardian opinion piece.\n\nOn the same day, United Democratic Movement leader Bantu Holomisa announced that lawyers acting on behalf of several opposition parties concerned about the credibility of the general election would approach the Electoral Court following the IEC chairperson Pansy Tlakula's refusal to agree to their call for her resignation. Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found Tlakula had been involved in building procurement irregularities in a report published in August 2013, and a subsequent National Treasury review published in March 2014 supported her findings. Five days before the election, the Electoral Court postponed the inquiry into her conduct until 2 June 2014, as it would not be able to rule on the matter before the 7 May election date. On 18 June, the Electoral Court recommended Tlakula's removal from office due to financial misconduct. Tlakula resigned as IEC chairperson on 1 September after an unsuccessful application to the Constitutional Court for leave to appeal the Electoral Court ruling.\n\nOn 22 April, the EFF also lodged a complaint with ICASA after the SABC banned an EFF election campaign television advert titled \"Now is the time for economic freedom\" that was due to be aired on 2 occasions, 2 days before the complaint was lodged and on the day the complaint was lodged. Four days after the complaint was lodged, ICASA upheld the SABC's ban on the advert. ICASA found that wording in the advert about physically destroying contentious e-tolls in Gauteng could incite violence and therefore contravened ICASA's regulations on party election broadcasts. The EFF advert had also highlighted police brutality, using interviews and photographs related to the Marikana massacre and the same photograph of the March 2014 Bekkersdal protest that ICASA ordered removed from the DA advert.\n\nNine days before the election, a Parliamentary committee set up to consider Zuma's response to Madonsela's final Nkandla report was referred to the next Parliament to be formed after the election, citing insufficient time available before the 7 May election date.\n\nTwo days before the election, Zuma spoke about the Nkandla scandal at a media briefing, saying it was only an issue with the media and the opposition, \"the bright people ... very clever people\", and not an issue with ANC voters.\n\nOn the day before the election, it was reported that the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (NSPCA) had ambushed election campaign posters by attaching matching NSPCA posters to the bottom of them. NSPCA spokesperson, Christine Kuch said that the NSPCA campaign hoped to get more political parties to include animal rights in their manifestos.\n\nCost \nDue to the secretive nature of political funding in South Africa generally little public information exists on both sources of political funding of South African political parties and the nature of their expenses however the ruling ANC did declare the 2014 elections to be the \"most expensive election\" it had ever fought to date.  According to leaked sources within the ANC the 2014 elections cost the ANC over R429-million.  Some of the ANC's expenses include R118 million on campaign T-shirts, R17-million for the manifesto launch in Mbombela, R83.7-million in advertising (including R27-million for posters and billboards), R21 million for the victory rally, and R67-million on volunteers.\n\nVoting\n\nInternational special votes\nOver 26,000 South Africans registered to participate in the national election in the international voting phase, which took place at 116 international voting stations on 30 April 2014. The last international voting station in Los Angeles closed at 6am SAST on 1 May 2014. All international votes were couriered to South Africa, combined into a single voting district and counted on 7 May 2014.\n\nThe IEC had budgeted R2 million to cover the cost of couriering the ballot papers from overseas.\n\nLocal special votes\nThe local special vote phase of the election took place on 5\u20136 May 2014, accommodating who are physically infirm, disabled or pregnant or were unable to vote at their voting station on the polling day. Former President Thabo Mbeki cast a special vote as he was attending a World Economic Forum meeting in Nigeria on polling day.\n\nVoting day\nVoting took place relatively smoothly at 22,264 voting stations in South Africa. It was reported that 2,449, or 11%, of the voting stations opened later than the scheduled opening time of 7am. All voting stations were operational by 11am. Voting stations closed and counting began at 9pm.\n\nA newly designed braille template was used for the first time in a National election, allowing blind voters to vote independently for the first time. In previous elections, blind voters had to communicate their choice of party to a voting official, who then filled in a ballot sheet on their behalf.\n\nIncidents\nOn voting day 97 people were arrested for election-related offences, primarily voter intimidation. A number of voters ignored the new legislation prohibiting photographs of marked ballot papers, including local celebrity DJ Sbu and footballer Andile Jali.\n\nThe chair of the Independent Electoral Commission, Pansy Tlakula, made it plain that electioneering was forbidden on the day of the election itself. 'No political events can take place on voting day,\u2019 she told reporters. 'Campaigning finished at midnight last night.' In the townships surrounding Cape Town it was evident that this ruling was extensively and openly flouted. As the day drew to a close, cavalcades of cars, with loudspeakers blaring out party songs and supporters waving flags from the windows, could be seen touring up and down the streets. Outside polling stations crowds, some more than a hundred strong, dressed in party colours and waving ANC flags, could be seen dancing less than a metre from the long lines of men and women waiting patiently to cast their votes. When this was drawn to the attention of the police and the representatives of the Electoral Commission at the stations they either shrugged their shoulders or said they did not have the resources to deal with these violations of the regulations.\n\nA voting station in Alexandra, Gauteng was temporarily closed after an argument broke out between ANC and EFF members when the EFF accused the ANC of vote-rigging. The voting station was opened later that afternoon.\n\nAn ANC supporter was fatally shot in KwaZulu-Natal by an IFP supporter near a voting station. Dumisani Nxumalo, a 28-year-old from KwaDukuza was charged with the murder. The Durban Regional Court saw his bail application on 26 June 2014 where it was alleged that the shooting took place while IFP supporters were walking past an ANC tent. The case was set to continue in July.\n\nResults\n\nThe Electoral Commission decided to exclude the votes from one voting station in Tickeyline, near Tzaneen in Limpopo, because staff at the voting station were attacked at the close of voting and the security of the ballot could not be assured. The final results were announced on 10 May.\n\nParliament\n\nNational Assembly\n\nNational Council of Provinces\nThe National Council of Provinces (NCOP) consists of 90 members, ten nominated by each provincial legislature, in proportion to the party membership of the provincial legislature. Each provincial delegation consists of six permanent delegates, who are nominated for a term that lasts until a new provincial legislature is elected, and four special delegates. One of the special delegates is the province's Premier, or another member of the provincial legislature designated by the Premier, while the other three special delegates are designated ad hoc by the provincial legislature.\n\nProvincial legislatures\nIn the provincial results of the election, the ANC won a majority in all the provincial legislatures except for the Western Cape, in which it came second to the DA. The DA came second in all other provinces except for Limpopo and the North West, in which it came third after the EFF.\n\nEastern Cape\n\nFree State\n\nGauteng\n\nKwaZulu-Natal\n\nLimpopo\n\nMpumalanga\n\nNorth West\n\nNorthern Cape\n\nWestern Cape\n\nNotes\n\nReactions\n\nDomestic\n\nPolitical\nAfrican National Congress supporters gathered in Johannesburg to celebrate the party's results. Jacob Zuma dedicated the ANC's victory to Nelson Mandela. The ANC requested an in-depth analysis of election results from its provincial election team in Gauteng. ANC spokesperson Nkenke Kekana said the ANC was concerned about its drop in support in the 2014 elections. Democratic Alliance leader, Helen Zille, published a press release thanking every South African who voted for the DA. She said that voters had responded positively to the DA's campaign, saying, \"We can look back proudly on what was undoubtedly the biggest and best campaign the DA has ever run.\" Economic Freedom Fighters commander-in-chief Julius Malema dedicated the EFF's result to the girls kidnapped in the Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping, saying, \"It looks impossible, but we have proved what looks impossible is possible.\" EFF supporters gathered at Innes Free Park in Sandton to celebrate the results. Inkatha Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi said in a statement that despite low estimations in the Ipsos polls, the IFP managed to retain its fourth-place position in the elections. Buthelezi thanked all South Africans who voted for the IFP and stated that he was proud to serve South Africa. Agang SA: Mamphela Ramphele congratulate all parties and candidates who contested the election. She expressed disappointment at Agang SA's poor performance, but stated that she was proud that her party achieved parliamentary representation despite it only being formed several months prior to the election. African Christian Democratic Party MP Steve Swart expressed disappointment that the ACDP did not grow its share of the vote, but was grateful that they were able to retain their support compared to other parties in the election.\n\nInternational\n\nRecognised states\n\nAfrica \nAngolan President Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos congratulated President Jacob Zuma and said that the election results reaffirmed the wish of South Africans to maintain the status quo.

Swaziland's ambassador to South Africa Senzangakhona Dlamini told President Zuma \"Swaziland agrees that South Africa has a good story to tell as you celebrate 20 years of democracy\". Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe congratulated President Jacob Zuma on the ANC's \"resounding victory\" and commended South Africans for their \"peaceful and exemplary conduct\" during the election.\n\nAmericas \nUnited States Secretary of State, John Kerry, congratulated South Africa on the elections in a press release when the voting had concluded.

He said, \"The general political and electoral environment was generally peaceful across the country, with voters being able to exercise their right to vote.\" Southern African Development Community Electoral Observation Mission said in a statement \"Guided by the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections, SEOM concludes that the 2014 National and Provincial Elections were peaceful, free, fair, transparent and credible, reflecting the will of the people of South Africa.\" Commonwealth of Nations Election Observer Mission chairperson, Nana Akufo-Addo said that the South African elections should be an example for the continent of Africa, saying, \"So when we see a process like this which seems to have been a commendable process taking place in South Africa, we see there is a tremendous boost to the spread of democracy in the rest of the continent.\"\n\nMedia\nBBC's Andrew Harding said that there was no massive change in the elections compared to previous years and Voice of America said that the increase in representation for opposition parties will provide \"great political entertainment\".\n\nAftermath\n\nEconomic\nOn 8 May 2014, the South African Rand grew 1.2% against the US dollar, reaching its highest level in four months. The following day, the Rand was still trading strongly as preliminary results showed that the ANC would defeat the EFF, whose left-wing policies worried investors.\n\nPolitical\nOn 7 June 2014, the Presidency issued a statement saying that Jacob Zuma had been admitted to hospital for tests following \"a demanding election and transition programme,\" and that doctors were satisfied with his condition.

In 2007, Coast to Coast added two additional services relatively new to the secondary ticket market: a ticket insurance option, allowing customers to obtain refunds should they be unable to attend an event, and a ticket-selling marketplace, where customers can add their own tickets to the ticket listings displayed on www.coasttocoasttickets.com.\n\nAwards\n\nIn November 2005, Street & Smith\u2019s  Journal ranked Coast to Coast as #7 out of the top 10 sports ticket brokers (based on Coast to Coast\u2019s 748,000 unique visitors to the site the previous month \u2013 a figure that had risen 469.9% from the same publication\u2019s list the previous year).\n\nThe Austin Business Journal also noted Coast to Coast\u2019s rapid growth by including the company in their 2005 and 2006 \"Fast 50\" lists for the fastest-growing Austin companies grossing under $10 million in revenue.\"Fast 50 - Growing Companies with revenue of under $10 million.\" Austin Business Journal.

It is the second of two similarly titled paintings based on nude photographs of his close friend Henrietta Moraes, who is shown in a reclining position on a bed, themselves part of a wider series of collapsed figures on beds that began with the 1963 triptych Lying Figure. This later version is widely considered the more successful of the two panels.\n\nMoraes and Bacon were drinking friends, she was a favourite model and he depicted her over a dozen times in a variety of forms, including single panel portraits, triptych portraits, and as part of larger scale figurations such as this panel. They knew each other from Soho's Colony Club, where they often met with John Deakin, another close friend, and a photographer whom Bacon commission to take the photographs on which the painting is based.\n\nMoraes was a noted beauty and an artists model in 1960s London, and a muse to Bacon, Lucian Freud and later to Maggi Hambling. Bacon was decidedly gay and did not often paint or show much interest in female nudes, although Deakin's original photographs are quite erotic, verging on voyeuristic and seedy. A few of Bacon's other incorporated influences, including Henry Fuseli's 1871 The Nightmare, which emphasis female sexuality and appeal, especially according to Sothebys, in the long hair and \"thrown back arm, so eloquent of physical abandon\". Bacon's painting contains traces of these influences, but is more focused on inner turmoil and projection of his bleak, nihilistic, outlook. This is apparent in the contorted and unflattering manner in which he depicts his model, and most especially in the manner she is seemingly pinned to the bed by the hypodermic syringe.\n\nBacon was avowedly against melodrama and loaded meanings in his paintings, and of for years seemed defensive in including such a direct  utensil as syringe. He instead saw the device as akin to the nails in a depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, a particular obsession of his, and said \"I've used the figures lying on beds with a hypodermic syringe as a form of nailing the image more strongly to reality or appearance. I don't put the syringe because of the drug that's being injected but because it's less stupid than putting a nail through the arm, which would be even more melodramatic.\" A bitter irony is that Moraes fell victim to heroin addiction from the 1970s.\n\nThe painting is similar in tone, form and theme to his 1967 Triptych Inspired by T.S. Eliot's Poem \"Sweeney Agonistes\", in which the central figure, also reclining, is reduced to a slab of flesh.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n Dawson, Barbara; Sylvester, David.

Furniture magnate Oscar Pappenheimer (1861-1917) built his first house on the site around 1900, which burned down in 1914. Pappenheimer rebuilt almost immediately, including a famous music room which contained a pipe organ as well as two grand pianos.\n\nInterest in classical music waned in the 1890s through 1910s and Pappenheimer was credited as being one of the sole forces encouraging the performance of chamber music in Atlanta. For more than three decades, informal concerts were given in his music room.\n\nHistory\nThe Pappenheimer family lived in the house until the 1930s, after which the house was used as a fraternity house for Georgia Tech students.\n\nBy 1941 it had become an ear, nose and throat hospital called the Ponce de Leon Infirmary, founded by Dr. Murdock Equen.\n\nIn 1977 it became Midtown Hospital, which specialized in second trimester abortions, performing the largest number of abortions of any institution in the state, more than 7000 in 1996. By the 1980s conditions in the hospital had deteriorated, conditions had become overcrowded and unsanitary and in 1988 the State of Georgia closed it.\n\nThe mansion was demolished in 1999 and the Marq on Ponce apartment complex now occupies the site.\n\nReferences\n\nHouses completed in 1900\nDemolished buildings and structures in Atlanta\nHospitals in Atlanta\nAmerican abortion providers\nMusic venues in Atlanta\nBuildings and structures demolished in 1999", "Edison light bulbs, also known as filament light bulbs and retroactively referred to as antique light bulbs or vintage light bulbs, are either carbon- or early tungsten-filament incandescent light bulbs, or modern bulbs that reproduce their appearance. Most of the bulbs in circulation are reproductions of the wound filament bulbs made popular by Edison Electric Light Company at the turn of the 20th century. They are easily identified by the long and complicated windings of their internal filaments, and by the very warm-yellow glow of the light they produce (many of the bulbs emit light at a color temperature of 2200\u20132400K).\n\nHistory \n\nLight bulbs with a carbon filament were first demonstrated by Edison in October 1879. These carbon filament bulbs, the first electric light bulbs, became available commercially that same year. In 1904 a tungsten filament was invented by Austro-Hungarians Alexander Just and Franjo Hanaman, and was more efficient and longer-lasting than the carbonized bamboo filament used previously.  The introduction of a neutral gas to the glass envelope (or bulb) also helped to improve the lifespan and brightness of the bulb. To produce enough light, these lamps required the use of extremely long filaments, which remained so until the development of more efficiently wound tungsten filaments.\n\nIn the 1960s, US inventor Robert (Bob) Kyp patented a similar in appearance but flickering \"electric flame\" light bulb under the name Balafire as well as radiometers. His flicker bulb was used in a 7-Up commercial, and the company he ran since 1964, Kyp-Go, is currently the only US manufacturer of carbon-filament bulbs.\n\nResurgence \nIn the 1980s, after watching a salvage operation, Bob Rosenzweig started the reproduction and selling of his faux-antique bulbs. These vintage-style light bulb reproductions were sold mostly to collectors and prop houses, and continued until the turn of the 21st century when new regulations banned low-efficiency lighting in many countries. However, while domestic lighting shifted toward more efficient compact fluorescent lamps and LED lights, demand for vintage bulbs likewise increased. Sold as \"specialty lighting\", Edison-style incandescent lamps are exempted from the ban in most places.\n\nMore contemporary \"Edison light bulbs\" are designed to replicate the same light color and bulb shape of the original, but offer a more energy-efficient version to Rosenzweig's popular vintage reproduction bulbs (modern tungsten coils are already more efficient). These bulbs maintain the same \"exposed\" look to further preserve the vintage reproduction style, and often employ the \"ST\" long-pear bulb shape for the same reason. LED bulbs, including LED retro types, are much more energy-efficient than any incandescent lighting.\n\nA 2010 article in The New York Times noted that some restaurants were hanging hundreds of Edison light bulbs from their ceilings, stating: \"Whether in hip hangouts tapping into the popular Victorian industrial look or elegant rooms seeking to warm up their atmosphere, the bulb has become a staple for restaurant designers, in part because it emulates candlelight and flatters both dinner and diner.\" \n\nWithin several years, the aesthetic spread globally. By August 2016, design reporter Kyle Chayka bemoaned in The Verge that every new cafe around the world was beginning to look the same no matter if a person was \"in Odessa, Beijing, Los Angeles, or Seoul: the same raw wood tables, exposed brick, and hanging Edison bulbs.\" Quartz would later trace the popularization of these looks to Brooklyn, New York.\n\nReferences\n\nTypes of lamp", "Nugu Wildlife Sanctuary is situated north of Bandipur National Park in Mysore District of Karnataka, India.

Conversely, immigration describes the movement of people into one country from another (to permanently move to a country). A migrant emigrates from their old country, and immigrates to their new country. Thus, both emigration and immigration describe migration, but from different countries' perspectives. \n\nDemographers examine push and pull factors for people to be pushed out of one place and attracted to another. There can be a desire to escape negative circumstances such as shortages of land or jobs, or unfair treatment. People can be pulled to the opportunities available elsewhere. Fleeing from oppressive conditions, being a refugee and seeking asylum to get refugee status in a foreign country, may lead to permanent emigration.\n\nForced displacement refers to groups that are forced to abandon their native country, such as by enforced population transfer or the threat of ethnic cleansing. Refugees and asylum seekers in this sense are the most marginalized extreme cases of migration, facing multiple hurdles in their journey and efforts to integrate into the new settings. Scholars in this sense have called for cross-sector engagement from businesses, non-governmental organizations, educational institutions, and other stakeholders within the receiving communities.\n\nHistory \n\nPatterns of emigration have been shaped by numerous economic, social, and political changes throughout the world in the last few hundred years. For instance, millions of individuals fled poverty, violence, and political turmoil in Europe to settle in the Americas and Oceania during the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. Likewise, millions left South China in the Chinese diaspora during the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\n\"Push\" and \"pull\" factors\n\nDemographers distinguish factors at the origin that push people out, versus those at the destination that pull them in.  Motives to migrate can be either incentives attracting people away, known as pull factors, or circumstances encouraging a person to leave. Diversity of push and pull factors inform management scholarship in their efforts to understand migrant movement.\n\nPush factors \n Poor living conditions or overcrowding\n Lack of employment or entrepreneurial opportunities\n Lack of educational opportunities\n Threat of arrest or punishment\n Persecution or intolerance based on race, religion, gender or sexual orientation\n Political corruption, lack of government transparency or freedom of speech\n Inability to find a spouse for marriage\n Lack of freedom to choose religion, or to choose no religion\n Resource depletion, scarcity or austerity\n Military draft, warfare or terrorism\n Expulsion by armed force or coercion\n Recession or economic collapse\n Famine or drought\n Cultural fights with other cultural groups\n\nPull factors \nHigher quality of life, economic growth or lower cost of living\nEncouragement to join relatives or fellow countrymen; chain migration\nQuick wealth (as in a gold rush)\nMore job opportunities or promise of higher pay\nProsperity or economic surplus\nEducational opportunity (including university for adults or K-12 for children)\nPrepaid travel (as from relatives)\nBuilding a new nation (historically)\nBuilding specific cultural or religious communities\nPolitical freedom\nCultural opportunities\nGreater opportunity to find a spouse\nFavorable climate \nEase of crossing boundaries\nReduced tariff\n\nCriticism \nSome scholars criticize the \"push-pull\" approach to understanding international migration. Regarding lists of positive or negative factors about a place, Jose C. Moya writes \"one could easily compile similar lists for periods and places where no migration took place.\"\n\nEmigration waves by country\n\nJews escaping from German-occupied Europe\nYerida (Jewish emigration from Israel)\nSwedish emigration to the United States\n\nStatistics \nUnlike immigration, in many countries few if any records have been recorded or maintained in regard to persons leaving a country either on a temporary or permanent basis. Therefore, estimates on emigration must be derived from secondary sources such as immigration records of the receiving country or records from other administrative agencies.\n\nThe rate of emigration has continued to grow, reaching 280 million in 2017.\n\nIn Armenia, for example, the migration is calculated by counting people arriving or leaving the country via airplane, train, railway or other means of transportation. Here, the emigration index is high: 1.5% of population leaves the country annually. In fact, it is one of the countries, where emigration has become a part of culture since 20th century. For example, between 1990 and 2005 approximately 700,000-1,300,000 Armenians left the country. The highly rising numbers of emigration are a direct response to socio-political and economic areas of the country. The internal migration (migration in country) is big (28.7%), while international migration is 71.3% of the total migration by people aging 15 and above. It is important to understand the reasons for both types of migration and the availability of the options. For example, in Armenia, everything is localized in the capital city Yerevan, thus, internal migration is from the villages and small cities to the biggest city of the country. The reason for the migration can be work or study. International migration follows the same reasoning of migration: work or study. The main destinations for it are Russia, France and US.\n\nEmigration restrictions \n\nSome countries restrict the ability of their citizens to emigrate to other countries. After 1668, the Qing Emperor banned Han Chinese migration to Manchuria. In 1681, the emperor ordered construction of the Willow Palisade, a barrier beyond which the Chinese were prohibited from encroaching on Manchu and Mongol lands.\n\nThe Soviet Socialist Republics of the later Soviet Union began such restrictions in 1918, with laws and borders tightening until even illegal emigration was nearly impossible by 1928. To strengthen this, they set up internal passport controls and individual city Propiska (\"place of residence\") permits, along with internal freedom of movement restrictions often called the 101st kilometre, rules which greatly restricted mobility within even small areas.\n\nAt the end of World War II in 1945, the Soviet Union occupied several Central European countries, together called the Eastern Bloc, with the majority of those living in the newly acquired areas aspiring to independence and wanted the Soviets to leave. Before 1950, over 15 million people emigrated from the Soviet-occupied eastern European countries and immigrated into the west in the five years immediately following World War II. By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling national movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc. Restrictions implemented in the Eastern Bloc stopped most east\u2013west migration, with only 13.3 million migrations westward between 1950 and 1990. However, hundreds of thousands of East Germans annually immigrated to West Germany through a \"loophole\" in the system that existed between East and West Berlin, where the four occupying World War II powers governed movement. The emigration resulted in massive \"brain drain\" from East Germany to West Germany of younger educated professionals, such that nearly 20% of East Germany's population had migrated to West Germany by 1961. In 1961, East Germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the Berlin Wall, effectively closing the loophole. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell, followed by German reunification and within two years the dissolution of the Soviet Union.\n\nBy the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to controlling international movement was also emulated by China, Mongolia, and North Korea. North Korea still tightly restricts emigration, and maintains one of the strictest emigration bans in the world, although some North Koreans still manage to illegally emigrate to China. Other countries with tight emigration restrictions at one time or another included Angola, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia, Afghanistan, Burma, Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia from 1975 to 1979), Laos, North Vietnam, Iraq, South Yemen and Cuba.\n\nSee also \n\nCanvas ceiling\nDeportation\nDiaspora\nEastern Bloc emigration and defection\n\u00c9migr\u00e9\nExile\nExpatriate\nFeminization of migration\nImmigration\nFoot voting\nHuman capital flight\nHuman migration\nSettlement\nInternational Organization for Migration\nMigration Letters\nPolitical asylum\nPolitical migration\nPopulation transfer\nRefugee\n\nSeparation barrier\nSnowbird (people)\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nLabour market efficiency and emigration in Slovakia and EU neighbouring countries,\n\nExternal links \n\n \n Translation from Galician to English of 4 Classic Emigration Ballads\n\n \nHuman migration\nPopulation", "Monotheism is the belief that there is only one deity, an all-supreme being that is universally referred to as God. A distinction may be made between exclusive monotheism, in which the one God is a singular existence, and both inclusive and pluriform monotheism, in which multiple gods or godly forms are recognized, but each are postulated as extensions of the same God.\n\nMonotheism is distinguished from henotheism, a religious system in which the believer worships one God without denying that others may worship different gods with equal validity, and monolatrism, the recognition of the existence of many gods but with the consistent worship of only one deity. The term monolatry was perhaps first used by Julius Wellhausen.\n\nMonotheism characterizes the traditions of B\u00e1bism, the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, Cheondoism, Christianity, Deism, Druzism, Eckankar, Sikhism, some sects of Hinduism (such as Shaivism and Vaishnavism), Islam, Judaism, Mandaeism, Rastafari, Seicho-no-Ie, Tenrikyo, Yazidism, and Atenism. Elements of monotheistic thought are found in early religions such as Zoroastrianism, ancient Chinese religion, and Yahwism.\n\nEtymology\nThe word monotheism comes from the Greek  (monos) meaning \"single\" and  (theos) meaning \"god\". The English term was first used by Henry More (1614\u20131687).\n\nHistory\n\nQuasi-monotheistic claims of the existence of a universal deity date to the Late Bronze Age, with Akhenaten's Great Hymn to the Aten from the 14th century BCE.\n\nIn the Iron-Age South Asian Vedic period, a possible inclination towards monotheism emerged. The Rigveda exhibits notions of monism of the Brahman, particularly in the comparatively late tenth book, which is dated to the early Iron Age, e.g. in the Nasadiya Sukta. Later, ancient Hindu theology was monist, but was not strictly monotheistic in worship because it still maintained the existence of many gods, who were envisioned as aspects of one supreme God, Brahman.\n\nIn China, the orthodox faith system held by most dynasties since at least the Shang Dynasty (1766\u00a0BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of Shangdi (literally \"Above Sovereign\", generally translated as \"God\") or Heaven as an omnipotent force. However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshiped along with Shangdi. Still, later variants such as Mohism (470 BCE\u2013c.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of Shangdi, akin to the angels in Abrahamic religions which in turn counts as only one god.\n\nSince the sixth century BCE, Zoroastrians have believed in the supremacy of one God above all: Ahura Mazda as the \"Maker of All\" and the first being before all others. While this is true, Zoroastrianism is not considered  monotheistic as it has a dualistic cosmology, with a pantheon of lesser \"gods\" or Yazats, such as Mithra, who are worshipped as lesser divinities alongside Ahura Mazda. Along with this, Ahura Mazda is not fully omnipotent engaged in a constant struggle with Angra Mainyu, the force of evil, although good will ultimately overcome evil.\n\nPost-exilic Judaism, after the late 6th century BCE, was the first religion to conceive the notion of a personal monotheistic God within a monist context. The concept of ethical monotheism, which holds that morality stems from God alone and that its laws are unchanging, first occurred in Judaism, but is now a core tenet of most modern monotheistic religions, including Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\n\nAlso from the 6th century BCE, Thales (followed by other Monists, such as Anaximander, Anaximenes, Heraclitus, Parmenides) proposed that nature can be explained by reference to a single unitary principle that pervades everything. Numerous ancient Greek philosophers, including Xenophanes of Colophon and Antisthenes, believed in a similar polytheistic monism that bore some similarities to monotheism. The first known reference to a unitary God is Plato's Demiurge (divine Craftsman), followed by Aristotle's unmoved mover, both of which would profoundly influence Jewish and Christian theology.\n\nAccording to Jewish, Christian and Islamic tradition, monotheism was the original religion of humanity; this original religion is sometimes referred to as \"the Adamic religion\", or, in the terms of Andrew Lang, the \"Urreligion\". Scholars of religion largely abandoned that view in the 19th century in favour of an evolutionary progression from animism via polytheism to monotheism, but by 1974, this theory was less widely held, and a modified view similar to Lang's became more prominent. Austrian anthropologist Wilhelm Schmidt had postulated an Urmonotheismus, \"original\" or \"primitive monotheism\" in the 1910s. It was objected that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam had grown up in opposition to polytheism as had Greek philosophical monotheism. More recently, Karen Armstrong and other authors have returned to the idea of an evolutionary progression beginning with animism, which developed into polytheism, which developed into henotheism, which developed into monolatry, which developed into true monotheism.\n\nAfrica\n\nIndigenous African religion\nThe Tikar people of Cameroon have a traditional spirituality that emphasizes the worship of a single god, Nyuy.\n\nThe Himba people of Namibia practice a form of monotheistic panentheism, and worship the god Mukuru. The deceased ancestors of the Himba and Herero are subservient to him, acting as intermediaries.\n\nThe Igbo people practice a form of monotheism called Odinani. Odinani has monotheistic and panentheistic attributes, having a single God as the source of all things. Although a pantheon of spirits exists, these are lesser spirits prevalent in Odinani expressly serving as elements of Chineke (or Chukwu), the supreme being or high god.\n\nWaaq is the name of a singular God in the traditional religion of many Cushitic people in the Horn of Africa, denoting an early monotheistic religion. However this religion was mostly replaced with the Abrahamic religions. Some (approximately 3%) of Oromo still follow this traditional monotheistic religion called Waaqeffanna in Oromo.\n\nAncient Egypt\n\nAtenism\n\nAmenhotep IV initially introduced Atenism in Year 5 of his reign (1348/1346 BCE) during the 18th dynasty of the New Kingdom. He raised Aten, once a relatively obscure Egyptian solar deity representing the disk of the sun, to the status of Supreme God in the Egyptian pantheon. To emphasise the change, Aten's name was written in the cartouche form normally reserved for Pharaohs, an innovation of Atenism. This religious reformation appears to coincide with the proclamation of a Sed festival, a sort of royal jubilee intended to reinforce the Pharaoh's divine powers of kingship. Traditionally held in the thirtieth year of the Pharaoh's reign, this possibly was a festival in honour of Amenhotep III, who some Egyptologists think had a coregency with his son Amenhotep IV of two to twelve years.\n\nYear 5 is believed to mark the beginning of Amenhotep IV's construction of a new capital, Akhetaten (Horizon of the Aten), at the site known today as Amarna. Evidence of this appears on three of the boundary stelae used to mark the boundaries of this new capital. At this time, Amenhotep IV officially changed his name to Akhenaten (Agreeable to Aten) as evidence of his new worship. The date given for the event has been estimated to fall around January 2 of that year. In Year 7 of his reign (1346/1344 BCE), the capital was moved from Thebes to Akhetaten (near modern Amarna), though construction of the city seems to have continued for two more years. In shifting his court from the traditional ceremonial centres Akhenaten was signalling a dramatic transformation in the focus of religious and political power.\n\nThe move separated the Pharaoh and his court from the influence of the priesthood and from the traditional centres of worship, but his decree had deeper religious significance too\u2014taken in conjunction with his name change, it is possible that the move to Amarna was also meant as a signal of Akhenaten's symbolic death and rebirth. It may also have coincided with the death of his father and the end of the coregency. In addition to constructing a new capital in honor of Aten, Akhenaten also oversaw the construction of some of the most massive temple complexes in ancient Egypt, including one at Karnak and one at Thebes, close to the old temple of Amun.\n\nIn Year 9 (1344/1342 BCE), Akhenaten declared a more radical version of his new religion, declaring Aten not merely the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon, but the only God of Egypt, with himself as the sole intermediary between the Aten and the Egyptian people. Key features of Atenism included a ban on idols and other images of the Aten, with the exception of a rayed solar disc, in which the rays (commonly depicted ending in hands) appear to represent the unseen spirit of Aten. Akhenaten made it however clear that the image of the Aten only represented the god, but that the god transcended creation and so could not be fully understood or represented. Aten was addressed by Akhenaten in prayers, such as the Great Hymn to the Aten: \"O Sole God beside whom there is none\".\n\nThe details of Atenist theology are still unclear. The exclusion of all but one god and the prohibition of idols was a radical departure from Egyptian tradition, but scholars see Akhenaten as a practitioner of monolatry rather than monotheism, as he did not actively deny the existence of other gods; he simply refrained from worshiping any but Aten. Akhenaten associated Aten with Ra and put forward the eminence of Aten as the renewal of the kingship of Ra.\n\nUnder Akhenaten's successors, Egypt reverted to its traditional religion, and Akhenaten himself came to be reviled as a heretic.\n\nAmericas\n\nNative American religion\nNative American religions may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, or some combination thereof. Cherokee religion, for example, is monotheist as well as pantheist.\n\nThe Great Spirit, called Wakan Tanka among the Sioux, and Gitche Manitou in Algonquian, is a conception of universal spiritual force, or supreme being prevalent among some Native American and First Nation cultures. According to Lakota activist Russell Means a better translation of Wakan Tanka is the Great Mystery.\n\nSome researchers have interpreted Aztec philosophy as fundamentally monotheistic or panentheistic. While the populace at large believed in a polytheistic pantheon, Aztec priests and nobles might have come to an interpretation of Teotl as a single universal force with many facets. There has been criticism to this idea, however, most notably that many assertions of this supposed monotheism might actually come from post-Conquistador bias, imposing an Antiquity pagan model unto the Aztec.\n\nEastern Asia\n\nChinese religion\n\nThe orthodox faith system held by most dynasties of China since at least the Shang Dynasty (1766\u00a0BCE) until the modern period centered on the worship of Shangdi (literally \"Above Sovereign\", generally translated as \"High-god\") or Heaven as a supreme being, standing above other gods. This faith system pre-dated the development of Confucianism and Taoism and the introduction of Buddhism and Christianity. It has some features of monotheism in that Heaven is seen as an omnipotent entity, a noncorporeal force with a personality transcending the world. However, this faith system was not truly monotheistic since other lesser gods and spirits, which varied with locality, were also worshiped along with Shangdi. Still, later variants such as Mohism (470 BCE\u2013c.391 BCE) approached true monotheism, teaching that the function of lesser gods and ancestral spirits is merely to carry out the will of Shangdi. In Mozi's Will of Heaven (\u5929\u5fd7), he writes:\n\nWorship of Shangdi and Heaven in ancient China includes the erection of shrines, the last and greatest being the Temple of Heaven in Beijing, and the offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform annual sacrificial rituals to Shangdi, usually by slaughtering a completely healthy bull as sacrifice. Although its popularity gradually diminished after the advent of Taoism and Buddhism, among other religions, its concepts remained in use throughout the pre-modern period and have been incorporated in later religions in China, including terminology used by early Christians in China. Despite the rising of non-theistic and pantheistic spirituality contributed by Taoism and Buddhism, Shangdi was still praised up until the end of the Qing Dynasty as the last ruler of the Qing declared himself son of heaven.\n\nTengrism\n\nTengrism or Tangrism (sometimes stylized as Tengriism), occasionally referred to as Tengrianism, is a modern term for a Central Asian religion characterized by features of shamanism, animism, totemism, both polytheism and monotheism, and ancestor worship. Historically, it was the prevailing religion of the Bulgars, Turks, Mongols, and Hungarians, as well as the Xiongnu and the Huns. It was the state religion of the six ancient Turkic states: Avar Khaganate, Old Great Bulgaria, First Bulgarian Empire, G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks Khaganate, Eastern Tourkia and Western Turkic Khaganate. In Irk Bitig, Tengri is mentioned as T\u00fcr\u00fck T\u00e4ngrisi (God of Turks). The term is perceived among Turkic peoples as a national religion.\n\nIn Chinese and Turco-Mongol traditions, the Supreme God is commonly referred to as the ruler of Heaven, or the Sky Lord granted with omnipotent powers, but it has largely diminished in those regions due to ancestor worship, Taoism's pantheistic views and Buddhism's rejection of a creator God. On some occasions in the mythology, the Sky Lord as identified as a male has been associated to mate with an Earth Mother, while some traditions kept the omnipotence of the Sky Lord unshared.\n\nEurope\n\nAncient proto-Indo-European religion\n\nThe head deity of the Proto-Indo-European religion was the god *Dy\u1e17us P\u1e25at\u1e17r . A number of words derived from the name of this prominent deity are used in various Indo-European languages to denote a monotheistic God. Nonetheless, in spite of this, Proto-Indo-European religion itself was not monotheistic.\n\nIn Eastern Europe, the ancient traditions of the Slavic religion contained elements of monotheism. In the sixth century AD, the Byzantine chronicler Procopius recorded that the Slavs \"acknowledge that one god, creator of lightning, is the only lord of all: to him do they sacrifice an ox and all sacrificial animals.\" The deity to whom Procopius is referring is the storm god Per\u00fan, whose name is derived from *Perkwunos, the Proto-Indo-European god of lightning. The ancient Slavs syncretized him with the Germanic god Thor and the Biblical prophet Elijah.\n\nAncient Greek religion\n\nClassical Greece\n\nThe surviving fragments of the poems of the classical Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon suggest that he held views very similar to those of modern monotheists. His poems harshly criticize the traditional notion of anthropomorphic gods, commenting that \"...if cattle and horses and lions had hands or could paint with their hands and create works such as men do,... [they] also would depict the gods' shapes and make their bodies of such a sort as the form they themselves have.\" Instead, Xenophanes declares that there is \"...one god, greatest among gods and humans, like mortals neither in form nor in thought.\" Xenophanes's theology appears to have been monist, but not truly monotheistic in the strictest sense. Although some later philosophers, such as Antisthenes, believed in doctrines similar to those expounded by Xenophanes, his ideas do not appear to have become widely popular.\n\nAlthough Plato himself was a polytheist, in his writings, he often presents Socrates as speaking of \"the god\" in the singular form. He does, however, often speak of the gods in the plural form as well. The Euthyphro dilemma, for example, is formulated as \"Is that which is holy loved by the gods because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?\"\n\nHellenistic religion\n\nThe development of pure (philosophical) monotheism is a product of the Late Antiquity. During the 2nd to 3rd centuries, early Christianity was just one of several competing religious movements advocating monotheism.\n\n\"The One\" (\u03a4\u1f78 \u1f1d\u03bd) is a concept that is prominent in the writings of the Neoplatonists, especially those of the philosopher Plotinus. In the writings of Plotinus, \"The One\" is described as an inconceivable, transcendent, all-embodying, permanent, eternal, causative entity that permeates throughout all of existence.\n\nA number of oracles of Apollo from Didyma and Clarus, the so-called \"theological oracles\", dated to the 2nd and 3rd century CE, proclaim that there is only one highest god, of whom the gods of polytheistic religions are mere manifestations or servants. 4th century CE Cyprus had, besides Christianity, an apparently monotheistic cult of Dionysus.\n\nThe Hypsistarians were a religious group who believed in a most high god, according to Greek documents. Later revisions of this Hellenic religion were adjusted towards monotheism as it gained consideration among a wider populace. The worship of Zeus as the head-god signaled a trend in the direction of monotheism, with less honour paid to the fragmented powers of the lesser gods.\n\nWestern Asia\n\nAbrahamic religions\n\nJudaism\n\nJudaism is traditionally considered one of the oldest monotheistic religions in the world, although in the 8th century BCE the Israelites were polytheistic, with their worship including the gods El, Baal, Asherah, and Astarte. Yahweh was originally the national god of the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah. During the 8th century BCE, the worship of Yahweh in Israel was in competition with many other cults, described by the Yahwist faction collectively as Baals. The oldest books of the Hebrew Bible reflect this competition, as in the books of Hosea and Nahum, whose authors lament the \"apostasy\" of the people of Israel, threatening them with the wrath of God if they do not give up their polytheistic cults.\n\nAs time progressed, the henotheistic cult of Yahweh grew increasingly militant in its opposition to the worship of other gods. Later, the reforms of King Josiah imposed a form of strict monolatrism. After the fall of Judah and the beginning of the Babylonian captivity, a small circle of priests and scribes gathered around the exiled royal court, where they first developed the concept of Yahweh as the sole God of the world.\n\nSecond Temple Judaism and later Rabbinic Judaism became strictly monotheistic. The Babylonian Talmud references other, \"foreign gods\" as non-existent entities to whom humans mistakenly ascribe reality and power. One of the best-known statements of Rabbinic Judaism on monotheism is the Second of Maimonides' 13 Principles of faith:\n\nSome in Judaism and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Modern Judaism uses the term shituf to refer to the worship of God in a manner which Judaism deems to be neither purely monotheistic (though still permissible for non-Jews) nor polytheistic (which would be prohibited).\n\nChristianity\n\nAmong early Christians, there was considerable debate over the nature of the Godhead, with some denying the incarnation but not the deity of Jesus (Docetism) and others later calling for an Arian conception of God. Despite at least one earlier local synod rejecting the claim of Arius, this Christological issue was to be one of the items addressed at the First Council of Nicaea.\n\nThe First Council of Nicaea, held in Nicaea (in present-day Turkey), convoked by the Roman Emperor Constantine I in 325, was the first ecumenical council of bishops of the Roman Empire, and most significantly resulted in the first uniform Christian doctrine, called the Nicene Creed. With the creation of the creed, a precedent was established for subsequent general ecumenical councils of bishops (synods) to create statements of belief and canons of doctrinal orthodoxy\u2014 the intent being to define a common creed for the Church and address heretical ideas.\n\nOne purpose of the council was to resolve disagreements in Alexandria over the nature of Jesus in relationship to the Father; in particular, whether Jesus was of the same substance as God the Father or merely of similar substance. All but two bishops took the first position; while Arius' argument failed.\n\nChristian orthodox traditions (Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestants) follow this decision, which was reaffirmed in 381 at the First Council of Constantinople and reached its full development through the work of the Cappadocian Fathers. They consider God to be a triune entity, called the Trinity, comprising three \"persons\", God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. These three are described as being \"of the same substance\" ().\n\nChristians overwhelmingly assert that monotheism is central to the Christian faith, as the Nicene Creed (and others), which gives the orthodox Christian definition of the Trinity, begins: \"I believe in one God\". From earlier than the times of the Nicene Creed, 325\u00a0CE, various Christian figures advocated the triune mystery-nature of God as a normative profession of faith. According to Roger E. Olson and Christopher Hall, through prayer, meditation, study and practice, the Christian community concluded \"that God must exist as both a unity and trinity\", codifying this in ecumenical council at the end of the 4th century.\n\nMost modern Christians believe the Godhead is triune, meaning that the three persons of the Trinity are in one union in which each person is also wholly God. They also hold to the doctrine of a man-god Christ Jesus as God incarnate. These Christians also do not believe that one of the three divine figures is God alone and the other two are not but that all three are mysteriously God and one. Other Christian religions, including Unitarian Universalism, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormonism and others, do not share those views on the Trinity.\n\nSome Christian faiths, such as Mormonism, argue that the Godhead is in fact three separate individuals which include God the Father, His Son Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost. Each individual having a distinct purpose in the grand existence of human kind. Furthermore, Mormons believe that before the Council of Nicaea, the predominant belief among many early Christians was that the Godhead was three separate individuals. In support of this view, they cite early Christian examples of belief in subordinationism.\n\nUnitarianism is a theological movement, named for its understanding of God as one person, in direct contrast to Trinitarianism.\n\nSome in Judaism and some in Islam do not consider Trinitarian Christianity to be a pure form of monotheism due to the pluriform monotheistic Christian doctrine of the Trinity, classifying it as shituf in Judaism and as shirk in Islam. Trinitarian Christians, on the other hand, argue that the doctrine of the Trinity is a valid expression of monotheism, citing that the Trinity does not consist of three separate deities, but rather the three persons, who exist consubstantially (as one substance) within a single Godhead.\n\nIslam\n\nIn Islam, God (All\u0101h) is all-powerful and all-knowing, the Creator, Sustainer, Ordainer and Judge of the universe. God in Islam is strictly singular (tawhid) unique (wahid) and inherently One (ahad), all-merciful and omnipotent. All\u0101h exists on the Al-'Arsh [Quran 7:54], but the Quran states that \"No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. God is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things\" [Quran 6:103] All\u0101h is the only God and the same God worshiped in Christianity and Judaism.().\n\nIslam emerged in the 7th century CE in the context of both Christianity and Judaism, with some thematic elements similar to Gnosticism. Islamic belief states that Muhammad did not bring a new religion from God, but rather the same religion as practiced by Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus and all the other prophets of God. The assertion of Islam is that the message of God had been corrupted, distorted or lost over time, and the Quran was sent to Muhammad in order to correct the lost message of the Tawrat (Torah), Injil (Gospel) and Zabur.\n\nThe Quran asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique and indivisible being who is independent of the creation. The Quran rejects binary modes of thinking such as the idea of a duality of God by arguing that both good and evil generate from God's creative act. God is a universal god rather than a local, tribal or parochial one; an absolute who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil. Ash'ari theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, insists on ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash'arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what has been revealed through the prophets, and on such paradoxes as God's creation of evil, revelation had to accept bila kayfa (without [asking] how).\n\nTawhid constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim profession of faith, \"There is no god but God, Muhammad is the messenger of God. To attribute divinity to a created entity is the only unpardonable sin mentioned in the Quran. The entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of tawhid.\n\nMedieval Islamic philosopher Al-Ghazali offered a proof of monotheism from omnipotence, asserting there can only be one omnipotent being. For if there were two omnipotent beings, the first would either have power over the second (meaning the second is not omnipotent) or not (meaning the first is not omnipotent); thus implying that there could only be one omnipotent being.\n\nAs they traditionally profess a concept of monotheism with a singular entity as God, Judaism and Islam reject the Christian idea of monotheism. Judaism uses the term Shituf to refer to non-monotheistic ways of worshiping God. Although Muslims venerate Jesus (Isa in Arabic) as a prophet, they do not accept the doctrine that he was a begotten son of God.\n\nMandaeism\n\nMandaeism or Mandaeanism ( ), sometimes also known as Sabianism, is a monotheistic, Gnostic, and ethnic religion. Mandaeans consider Adam, Seth, Noah, Shem and John the Baptist to be prophets, with Adam being the founder of the religion and John being the greatest and final prophet. The Mandaeans believe in one God commonly named Hayyi Rabbi meaning 'The Great Life' or 'The Great Living God'. The Mandaeans speak a dialect of Eastern Aramaic known as Mandaic. The name 'Mandaean' comes from the Aramaic manda meaning \"knowledge\", as does Greek gnosis. The term 'Sabianism' is derived from the Sabians (, ), a mysterious religious group mentioned three times in the Quran alongside the Jews, the Christians and the Zoroastrians as a 'people of the book', and whose name was historically claimed by the Mandaeans as well as by several other religious groups in order to gain the legal protection () offered by Islamic law. Mandaeans recognize God to be the eternal, creator of all, the one and only in domination who has no partner.\n\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith\n\nGod in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith is taught to be the Imperishable, uncreated Being Who is the source of existence, too great for humans to fully comprehend. Human primitive understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his divine intermediary Manifestations. In the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed faith, such Christian doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed view that God is single and has no equal,\nand the very existence of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith is a challenge to the Islamic doctrine of the finality of Muhammad's revelation.\n\nGod in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith communicates to humanity through divine intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God. These Manifestations establish religion in the world. It is through these divine intermediaries that humans can approach God, and through them God brings divine revelation and law.\n\nThe Oneness of God is one of the core teachings of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. The obligatory prayers in the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith involve explicit monotheistic testimony. God is the imperishable, uncreated being who is the source of all existence. He is described as \"a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty\". Although transcendent and inaccessible directly, his image is reflected in his creation. The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator. God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through intermediaries, known as Manifestations of God, who are the prophets and messengers that have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present day.\n\nRastafari\nRastafari, sometimes termed Rastafarianism, is classified as both a new religious movement and social movement. It developed in Jamaica during the 1930s. It lacks any centralised authority and there is much heterogeneity among practitioners, who are known as Rastafari, Rastafarians, or Rastas.\n\nRastafari refer to their beliefs, which are based on a specific interpretation of the Bible, as \"Rastalogy\". Central is a monotheistic belief in a single God\u2014referred to as Jah\u2014who partially resides within each individual. The former emperor of Ethiopia, Haile Selassie, is given central importance. Many Rastas regard him as an incarnation of Jah on Earth and as the Second Coming of Christ. Others regard him as a human prophet who fully recognised the inner divinity within every individual.\n\nZoroastrianism\n\nZoroastrianism combines cosmogonic dualism and eschatological monotheism which makes it unique among the religions of the world. It is contested whether they are monotheistic, due to the presence of Ahura Mainyu, and the existence of worshipped lesser divinities such as Aharaniyita.\n\nBy some Zoroastrianism is considered a monotheistic religion, but this is contested as both true and false by both scholars, and Zoroastrians themselves. Although Zoroastrianism is often regarded as dualistic, duotheistic or bitheistic, for its belief in the hypostasis of the ultimately good Ahura Mazda (Wise Lord) and the ultimately evil Angra Mainyu (destructive spirit). Zoroastrianism was once one of the largest religions on Earth, as the official religion of the Persian Empire. By some scholars, the Zoroastrians (\"Parsis\" or \"Zartoshtis\") are sometimes credited with being some of the first monotheists and having had influence on other world religions. Gathered statistics estimates the number of adherents at between 100,000 and 200,000, with adherents living in many regions, including South Asia.\n\nYazidism\n\nGod in Yazidism created the world and entrusted it into the care of seven Holy Beings, known as Angels. The Yazidis believe in a divine Triad. The original, hidden God of the Yazidis is considered to be remote and inactive in relation to his creation, except to contain and bind it together within his essence. His first emanation is the Angel Melek Ta\u00fbs (), who functions as the ruler of the world and leader of the other Angels. The second hypostasis of the divine Triad is the Sheikh 'Ad\u012b ibn Musafir. The third is Sultan Ezid. These are the three hypostases of the one God. The identity of these three is sometimes blurred, with Sheikh 'Ad\u012b considered to be a manifestation of Taw\u00fbs\u00ea Melek and vice versa; the same also applies to Sultan Ezid. Yazidis are called  (\"the nation of Taw\u00fbs\u00ea Melek\").\n\nGod is referred to by Yazidis as , , , and  ('King'), and, less commonly,  and . According to some Yazidi hymns (known as Qewls), God has 1,001 names, or 3,003 names according to other Qewls.\n\nOceania\n\nAboriginal Australian religion\nAboriginal Australians are typically described as polytheistic in nature. Although some researchers shy from referring to Dreamtime figures as \"gods\" or \"deities\", they are broadly described as such for the sake of simplicity.\n\nIn Southeastern Australian cultures, the sky father Baiame is perceived as the creator of the universe (though this role is sometimes taken by other gods like Yhi or Bunjil) and at least among the Gamilaraay traditionally revered above other mythical figures. Equation between him and the Christian god is common among both missionaries and modern Christian Aboriginals.\n\nThe Yolngu had extensive contact with the Makassans and adopted religious practises inspired by those of Islam. The god Walitha'walitha is based on Allah (specifically, with the wa-Ta'ala suffix), but while this deity had a role in funerary practises it is unclear if it was \"Allah-like\" in terms of functions.\n\nAndaman Islands\nThe religion of the Andamanese peoples has at times been described as \"animistic monotheism\", believing foremost in a single deity, Paluga, who created the universe. However, Paluga is not worshipped, and anthropomorphic personifications of natural phenomena are also known.\n\nSouth Asia\n\nHinduism\n\nAs an old religion, Hinduism inherits religious concepts spanning monotheism, polytheism, panentheism, pantheism, monism, and atheism among others; and its concept of God is complex and depends upon each individual and the tradition and philosophy followed.\n\nHindu views are broad and range from monism, through pantheism and panentheism (alternatively called monistic theism by some scholars) to monotheism and even atheism. Hinduism cannot be said to be purely polytheistic. Hindu religious leaders have repeatedly stressed that while God's forms are many and the ways to communicate with him are many, God is one. The puja of the murti is a way to communicate with the abstract one god (Brahman) which creates, sustains and dissolves creation.\n\nRig Veda 1.164.46,\n\n\"They call him Indra, Mitra, Varu\u1e47a, Agni, and he is heavenly nobly-winged Garuda.\nTo what is One, sages give many a title they call it Agni, Yama, M\u0101tari\u015bvan.\" (trans. Griffith)\n\nTraditions of Gaudiya Vaishnavas, the Nimbarka Sampradaya and followers of Swaminarayan and Vallabha consider Krishna to be the source of all avatars, and the source of Vishnu himself, or to be the same as Narayana. As such, he is therefore regarded as Svayam Bhagavan.\n\nWhen Krishna is recognized to be Svayam Bhagavan, it can be understood that this is the belief of Gaudiya Vaishnavism, the Vallabha Sampradaya, and the Nimbarka Sampradaya, where Krishna is accepted to be the source of all other avatars, and the source of Vishnu himself. This belief is drawn primarily \"from the famous statement of the Bhagavatam\" (1.3.28). A viewpoint differing from this theological concept is the concept of Krishna as an avatar of Narayana or Vishnu. It should be however noted that although it is usual to speak of Vishnu as the source of the avataras, this is only one of the names of the God of Vaishnavism, who is also known as Narayana, Vasudeva and Krishna and behind each of those names there is a divine figure with attributed supremacy in Vaishnavism.\n\nThe Rig Veda discusses monotheistic thought, as do the Atharva Veda and Yajur Veda:\n\"Devas are always looking to the supreme abode of Vishnu\" (tad vi\u1e63\u1e47o\u1e25 parama\u1e41 pada\u1e41 sad\u0101 pa\u015byanti s\u1e7braya\u1e25 Rig Veda 1.22.20)\n\n\"The One Truth, sages know by many names\" (Rig Veda 1.164.46)\n\n\"When at first the unborn sprung into being, He won His own dominion beyond which nothing higher has been in existence\" (Atharva Veda 10.7.31)\n\n\"There is none to compare with Him. There is no parallel to Him, whose glory, verily, is great.\" (Yajur Veda 32.3)\n\nThe number of auspicious qualities of God are countless, with the following six qualities (bhaga) being the most important:\n J\u00f1\u0101na (omniscience), defined as the power to know about all beings simultaneously\n Aishvarya (sovereignty, derived from the word Ishvara), which consists in unchallenged rule over all\n Shakti (energy), or power, which is the capacity to make the impossible possible\n Bala (strength), which is the capacity to support everything by will and without any fatigue\n V\u012brya (vigor), which indicates the power to retain immateriality as the supreme being in spite of being the material cause of mutable creations\n Tejas (splendor), which expresses His self-sufficiency and the capacity to overpower everything by His spiritual effulgence\n\nIn the Shaivite tradition, the Shri Rudram (Sanskrit \u0936\u094d\u0930\u093f \u0930\u0941\u0926\u094d\u0930\u092e\u094d), to which the Chamakam (\u091a\u092e\u0915\u092e\u094d) is added by scriptural tradition, is a Hindu stotra dedicated to Rudra (an epithet of Shiva), taken from the Yajurveda (TS 4.5, 4.7). Shri Rudram is also known as Sri Rudraprasna, , and Rudradhyaya. The text is important in Vedanta where Shiva is equated to the Universal supreme God. The hymn is an early example of enumerating the names of a deity, a tradition developed extensively in the sahasranama literature of Hinduism.\n\nThe Nyaya school of Hinduism has made several arguments regarding a monotheistic view. The Naiyanikas have given an argument that such a god can only be one. In the Nyaya Kusumanjali, this is discussed against the proposition of the Mimamsa school that let us assume there were many demigods (devas) and sages (rishis) in the beginning, who wrote the Vedas and created the world. Nyaya says that:\n\nIn other words, Nyaya says that the polytheist would have to give elaborate proofs for the existence and origin of his several celestial spirits, none of which would be logical, and that it is more logical to assume one eternal, omniscient god.\n\nMany other Hindus, however, view polytheism as far preferable to monotheism. The famous Hindu revitalist leader Ram Swarup, for example, points to the Vedas as being specifically polytheistic, and states that, \"only some form of polytheism alone can do justice to this variety and richness.\"\n\nSita Ram Goel, another 20th-century Hindu historian, wrote:\n\nSikhism\n\nSikhi is a monotheistic and a revealed religion.\nGod in Sikhi is called Akal Purakh (which means \"the true immortal\") or V\u0101higur\u016b the Primal being. However, other names like Ram, Allah etc. are also used to refer to the same god, who is shapeless, timeless, and sightless: nira\u1e45k\u0101r, akaal, and alakh. Sikhi presents a unique perspective where God is present (sarav vi\u0101pak) in all of its creation and does not exist outside of its creation. God must be seen from \"the inward eye\", or the \"heart\". Sikhs follow the Aad Guru Granth Sahib and are instructed to meditate on the Naam (Name of God - V\u0101higur\u016b) to progress towards enlightenment, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.\n\nSikhism is a monotheistic faith that arose in northern region of the Indian subcontinent during the 16th and 17th centuries. Sikhs believe in one, timeless, omnipresent, supreme creator. The opening verse of the Guru Granth Sahib, known as the Mul Mantra, signifies this:\n\nTransliteration: ikk \u014dank\u0101r sat(i)-n\u0101m(u) karat\u0101 purakh(u) nirabha'u niravair(u) ak\u0101la m\u016brat(i) aj\u016bn\u012b saibhan(g) gur(a) pras\u0101d(i).\nOne Universal creator God, The supreme Unchangeable Truth, The Creator of the Universe, Beyond Fear, Beyond Hatred, Beyond Death, Beyond Birth, Self-Existent, by Guru's Grace.\n\nThe word \"\u0a74\" (\"Ik \u014da\u1e45k\u0101r\") has two components. The first is \u0a67, the digit \"1\" in Gurmukhi signifying the singularity of the creator. Together the word means: \"One Universal creator God\".\n\nIt is often said that the 1430 pages of the Guru Granth Sahib are all expansions on the Mul Mantra. Although the Sikhs have many names for God, some derived from Islam and Hinduism, they all refer to the same Supreme Being.\n\nThe Sikh holy scriptures refer to the One God who pervades the whole of space and is the creator of all beings in the universe. The following quotation from the Guru Granth Sahib highlights this point:\n\nHowever, there is a strong case for arguing that the Guru Granth Sahib teaches monism due to its non-dualistic tendencies:\n\nSikhs believe that God has been given many names, but they all refer to the One God, V\u0101hiGur\u016b. Sikh holy scripture (Guru Granth Sahib) speaks to all faiths and Sikhs believe that members of other religions such as Islam, Hinduism and Christianity all worship the same God, and the names Allah, Rahim, Karim, Hari, Raam and Paarbrahm are, therefore, frequently mentioned in the Sikh holy scripture (Guru Granth Sahib) . God in Sikhism is most commonly referred to as Akal Purakh (which means \"the true immortal\") or Waheguru, the Primal Being.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n William G.

His credits included The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour. Most notably, co-created the variety show, Hee Haw, in 1969 with John Aylesworth.\n\nPeppiatt was born to Frank and Sarah Peppiatt in Toronto, Ontario, on March 19, 1927. He attended the University of Toronto, where he earned a bachelor's degree in 1949. He took a job with his Toronto classmate, Norman Jewison, after college working on college stage productions. Peppiatt then worked as an advertising copywriter at MacLaren Advertising where he met and worked with John Aylesworth. Their work on television advertising led the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to approach them to write comedy sketches for a variety show called After Hours. This led to a long professional partnership with Aylesworth. Peppiatt made the jump from Canadian to American television by the mid-1950s.\n\nIn addition to Hee Haw, Peppiatt and Aylesworth teamed up to write or produce Perry Como's Kraft Music Hall, The Judy Garland Show, Frank Sinatra: A Man and His Music, The ABC Comedy Hour, The Julie Andrews Hour, and Hullabaloo.

In 911 A.D., a group of \"pirates\", or Vikings led by Rollo besieged Paris and Chartres. After a victory near Chartres on 26 August, Charles the Simple decided to negotiate with Rollo, resulting in the Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte. For the Vikings' loyalty, they were granted all the land between the river Epte and the sea, as well as Brittany, which at the time was an independent country which France had unsuccessfully tried to conquer. Rollo also agreed to be baptised and to marry Charles' daughter, Gisela. The land would become known as \"Normandy\", the land of the North Men and included \"Les \u00celes d'la Manche\" or the Channel Islands. Religion was strengthened with the arrival and conversion of the Normans to Christianity, in the 10th century.\n\nSecond millennium\n\nThere were many churches built by the Normans in the 11th and 12th centuries, many on top of previous chapels which were themselves alongside pagan places of worship, the islands being divided up into parishes in the 11th century and land areas granted by endowment to French-based religious centres, Mont Saint Michel Abbey received four and Marmoutier Abbey, Tours six from Guernsey, Cerisy-la-For\u00eat acquired two in Jersey, but most other Jersey parishes were scattered amongst other people and institutions.\n\nThe Islands embraced the French Calvinist form of Protestantism during the Reformation Roman Catholicism continued until orders were received to remove all signs of Catholicism in 1547. A brief return to Catholicism saw the three women turned into martyrs before another turn, back to the Protestant faith and a fear of France and Catholics. Methodism took a stronghold at the end of the 18th century.\n\nThe Little Chapel in Guernsey has been said that it \"is the smallest functioning chapel in Europe, if not the world\", and it is \"believed to be the world\u2019s smallest consecrated church.\"\n\nAt least three churches in Guernsey have pre-history carved stones, the most famous being La Gran'm\u00e8re du Chimqui\u00e8re. In Jersey, at La Hougue Bie a 12th-century chapel was built on a Neolithic ritual site which was in use around 3500\u00a0BC. In Western Europe, it is one of the largest and best preserved passage graves. Several churches, including Castel Church, Guernsey, have been built using materials dating back to the Roman Empire. St Saviour Church in Guernsey has a number of tunnels running underneath, built by the Organisation Todt for Nazi Germany in the 1940s.\n\nThe historic toleration of religious minorities has led to many persecuted minorities seeking refuge in the Islands, such as Huguenots from 1548. The influx of the Protestant refugees led to Calvinism becoming the main religion, forcing a break from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Coutances in 1568 to the Bishop of Winchester. Religion became strictly enforced with physical punishments (whippings, stocks, imprisonment) and torture to get confessions for Channel Islands Witch Trials for 100 years, ending only with the Act of Uniformity 1662 of Charles II of England. In the English Civil War Guernsey, with stronger puritanical sympathies supported Parliament whereas Jersey was happy to restore episcopalian constitutions, siding with the Royalists.\n\nA famous refugee Guernsey in 1855 was Victor Hugo who increasingly expressed anti-Catholic and anti-clerical views. Hugo counted 740 attacks on a book he wrote whilst in Guernsey, Les Mis\u00e9rables in the Catholic press. The last major act of non-toleration goes back to 1556, with the Guernsey Martyrs who died for their Protestant faith. The Island's toleration has left a rich legacy of churches, chapels and places of worship.\n\nThe maintenance of parish churches was, before the Reformation, the responsibility of the Catholic Church. To avoid the English Crown taking over responsibility as successor, Charles II in 1677 instructed the Guernsey churchwardens to raise monies from the parishioners.\n\nIn 1893 a religious census was undertaken in Guernsey showing around 50% of the population attended:\n\n Anglican \u2013 17 places \u2013 5,998 attendants\n French Wesleyan \u2013 17 places \u2013 2,989 attendants\n Salvation Army \u2013 4 places \u2013 1,941 attendants\n English Wesleyan \u2013 6 places \u2013 1,783 attendants\n English R.C. \u2013 2 places \u2013 1,021 attendants\n Baptist \u2013 6 places \u2013 663 attendants\n\n French R.C. \u2013 2 places \u2013 588 attendants\n Independent \u2013 5 places \u2013 533 attendants\n Brethren \u2013 6 places \u2013 507 attendants\n New Connexion \u2013 1 place \u2013 452 attendants\n Primitive Methodist \u2013 2 places \u2013 315 attendants\n Other \u2013 7 places \u2013 800 attendants\n\nThird millennium\nThe 2010 breakdown of followers in the Channel Islands: \n\n Christians 84%\n\n Agnostics 14%\n\n Atheists 1%\n\n Other religions 1%\n\nIn 2022 the Anglican churches moved from under Winchester, where they had been for 500 years, to the Diocese of Salisbury.\n\nReligions\n\n Anglicanism \u2013 The Deanery of Guernsey of the Church of England comes under the Diocese of Salisbury, but until 2015 was under the Diocese of Winchester. \n Baptists \u2013 The Baptist Christian faith has been practised in Guernsey for over 200 years.\n Church of Scotland \u2013 The Church has very few churches outside Scotland, but both Guernsey and Jersey have kirks.

It was held on outdoor hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City. Experimental rules featured in qualifying for the main draw as well as in the junior, wheelchair and exhibition events.\n\nStan Wawrinka and Angelique Kerber were the previous year's men's and women's singles champions. Neither managed to defend their title as Wawrinka withdrew before the start of the tournament due to a knee injury that ended his season, while Kerber lost in the first round to Naomi Osaka.\n\nThe men's singles tournament concluded with Rafael Nadal defeating Kevin Anderson in the final, while the women's singles tournament concluded with Sloane Stephens defeating Madison Keys in the final.\n\nTournament\n\nThe 2017 US Open was the 137th edition of the tournament and took place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park of Queens in New York City, New York, United States. The tournament was held on 15 DecoTurf hard courts.\n\nThe tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and was part of the 2017 ATP World Tour and the 2017 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as a mixed doubles event. There were also singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which were part of the Grade A category of tournaments. Additionally, there were singles and doubles wheelchair tennis events for men, women and quads.\n\nThe 2017 tournament saw the USTA try out two experimental rules. Firstly, the USTA introduced a shot clock to combat slow play and to address players going over the allotted time for warm ups and medical time outs. Secondly, coaching was allowed from the side of the court. Whilst a player was at the same end as their box they could verbally communicate, if they were at the opposite end then sign language would be allowed. This meant that coaching incidents involving Victoria Azarenka and Caroline Garcia at Wimbledon would have been allowed. The rules only applied in qualifying matches for the main draw, junior, wheelchair and legends matches.\n\nThe tournament was played on hard courts and took place over a series of 15 courts with DecoTurf surface, including the two existing main showcourts \u2013 Arthur Ashe Stadium and the new Grandstand. Louis Armstrong Stadium, one of the main stadiums used in the previous tournament, was demolished after the 2016 tournament and was replaced for the 2017 edition by a temporary stadium located next to parking lot B near the construction of the previous Louis Armstrong Stadium site.\n\nBroadcast\nIn the United States, the 2017 US Open will be the third year in a row under an 11-year, $825 million contract with ESPN, in which the broadcaster holds exclusive rights to the entire tournament and the US Open Series. This means that the tournament is not available on broadcast television. This also makes ESPN the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for three of the four tennis majors. In Australia, SBS won the rights to broadcast the US Open with the free to air coverage starting from the quarter finals.\n\nAm\u00e9ricas \n\n Latin America: ESPN \n : ESPN and TyC Sports \n : ESPN and SporTV \n : ESPN and Tigo Sports \n : ESPN and\n\nPoint and prize money distribution\n\nPoint distribution\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event.\n\nSenior\n\nWheelchair\n\nJunior\n\nPrize money\nThe total prize-money compensation for the 2017 US Open is $50.4 million, a 3.7% increase on the same total last year. Of that total, a record $3.7 million goes to both the men's and women's singles champions, which is increased to 7.5 percent from last year. This made the US Open the most lucrative and highest paying tennis grand slam in the world, leapfrogging Wimbledon in total prize money fund. Prize money for the US Open qualifying tournament is also up 49.2 percent, to $2.9 million.

S\u0142owacki wrote that he created the poem \"full of those feelings and thoughts, which were freshly inspired in me by the Holy Land and a night spent by the tomb of Jesus\".  The poem was edited in Florence and published in Paris in 1838 in the Polish Library and Printing Press located at Marais Saint-Germain No 17. The print on the 108 pages of the poem was produced by Bourgogne et Martinet printing house. S\u0142owacki dedicated his work to Stefan Ho\u0142y\u0144ski.\n\nThe poem conveys a pessimistic vision of the future of Polish emigration and the fight for the country's independence. It directly alludes to Adam Mickiewicz's Books of the Polish Nation and Polish Pilgrimage by employing stylized biblical prose. It portrays antagonized Polish exiles who are destined for destruction in the realities of Siberia, a place strongly associated with the martyrology of the Polish nation. It sends a messianistic message and poses the question whether the whole nation can ever be saved by an individual or an entire generation of emigrants.\n\nAnhelli served as inspiration for the symphonic poem of the same name by Ludomir R\u00f3\u017cycki composed in 1909. The poem is also the basis of Anhelli. The Calling, the last part of a theatrical triptych Gospels of Childhood produced by Wroc\u0142aw-based ZAR Theatre.\n\nPlot\nThe main plot of the work revolves around the journey through Siberia undertaken by the titular character, a youth named Anhelli, and his guide Shaman, leader of a Siberian tribe. Anhelli was chosen by Shaman from Polish exiles as the redeemer because of his \"purity and sinlessness\" and he was to be subjected to an initiation by taking part in a journey to see the suffering of the nation. Siberia is portrayed in S\u0142owacki's poem as \"white hell\" for Polish exiles, a place of execution and spiritual downfall. The main characters wander through various places from deserts and abandoned graveyards through forests to the dark mines of Siberia. Their journey is reminiscent of Dante's journey through hell where the main protagonist, accompanied by Virgil, crosses the circles of hell meeting the damned along the way. Polish exiles are depicted as travelling across a deserted, hostile and hellish country, working hard in mines, suffering in cold dungeons with shackles on their legs and enduring beatings and humiliation. Their children are starving and are subjected to forced Russification.\n\nAnhelli and Shaman's journey starts from the House of Exiles and was supposed to end there as well. However, Shaman's death resulting from a fight among the exiles forces Anhelli to embark on another journey to a faraway desert in the north where he dwells in a hut carved out from ice. Upon the death of Ellenai, a penitent and Anhelli's exiled companion, he is visited by two angels heralding the end of the world as well as his own death. Soon after, he also passes away and is not awakened by the call of the armoured Knight to resurrect and take revenge on the oppressors.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\nPolish poets\nThree Bards\nKordian\n\nReferences\n\n1837 poems\nPolish poems\nWorks by Juliusz S\u0142owacki\nWorks set in Siberia", "Daniel O\u2019Connell Griffin (born 15 July 1967) is an American infectious disease specialist.

Hartmann and J. Robert Bren, based on a story by Taylor Caven. RKO Radio Pictures produced the film, which stars Constance Worth, Vinton Haworth, Leslie Fenton and Gordon Jones. Haworth was injured in an automobile accident in January 1937, delaying the film's released until March 12, 1937.\n\nPlot\nTom Baldwin and Joe Dugan are two American adventurers who are hired to escort the wife of a Chinese general to Shanghai. She is carrying a priceless diamond. Upon their arrival at the destination, there is a firefight, during which the diamond is stolen. The two Americans round up a group of suspects, but have no luck uncovering the stolen jewel. Among the suspects are Jane Dunn and Katherine Collins, an author named Anthony Durand and Harvey Dinwiddle. They release the suspects and then make plans to travel to San Francisco. When they board the ship, they are surprised to find that all of the suspects are also aboard the same boat.\n\nBaldwin and Dugan resume their search for the diamond and soon discover that Jane is actually an American customs agent who is also trying to find the jewel. As their search continues, Baldwin and Jane fall in love. After their room is tossed, Dugan is killed. Katherine is an insurance investigator who has uncovered some information, but she is killed before she can pass that information on to Jane and Baldwin. Baldwin is framed for Katherine's murder, but Jane solves the diamond's theft and the murders, revealing that Durand and his henchman Dinwiddle are the perpetrators.\n\nBaldwin and Jane are married by the ship's captain.\n\nCast\n\n Constance Worth as Jane Dunn\n Vinton Haworth as Tom Baldwin\n Leslie Fenton as Anthony Durand\n Gordon Jones as Joe Dugan\n Alec Craig as Harvey Dinwiddle\n Dick Elliott as Philip Burton\n Frank M. Thomas as Captain Williams\n George Irving as Dr. Sibley\n Billy Gilbert as Bartender\n Joyce Compton as Mrs. Katharine Collins\n Philip Ahn as Dr. Feng Tu\n Lotus Long as Lia Sen\n Huntley Gordon as Arthur Trent\n Edgar Dearing as Bill\n Lotus Liu as Yo Ling\n Tetsu Komai as Wong\n Moy Ming as Chang\n William Corson as Officer\n Alan Curtis as Officer\n\nProduction\nRKO obtained the rights to Taylor Craven's original story, Miss Customs Agent, in July 1936, and its title was also the film's working title. Edward Killy was assigned to direct the film in mid-October, and filming was slated to begin in mid-November. In the first week of December, it was announced that seven performers had been assigned to the project: Vinton Hayworth, Constance Worth (in her American screen debut), Frank Thomas, Walter Coy, Diana Gibson, Gordon Jones and George Irving. Dick Elliot joined the cast in mid-December, and production began shortly before Christmas. In late December, Joyce Compton joined the cast, and shortly thereafter, the film's title was changed to China Passage. Production was delayed for two weeks at the beginning of 1937 when Vincent Haworth was injured in a car accident on New Year's Day. He was released to return to work on January 12. The film was finished by the end of January 1937, and the editing process began in the first week of February. The film opened on March 12, 1937. After the film premiered, the National Legion of Decency assigned the film an A-1 rating, classifying it as unobjectionable for general audiences.\n\nReception\nThe Film Daily fair review called the story \"stilted, unoriginal and implausible\" and praised only the film's technical aspects of the film. Harrison's Reports also published a negative review, calling the plot \"far-fetched and meaningless\" and the comedic portions \"tired.\" However, the review reported that Constance Worth's her acting was \"pleasant,\" as were the romantic interludes between Worth and Vinton Hayworth. Motion Picture Daily was more positive, writing that the film was \"unpretentious\" and \"moderately entertaining,\" with Worth \"capable\" and \"attractive\" and Leslie Fenton's sinister performance laudable. Motion Picture Magazine awarded the film two and a half stars (out of four) and complimented the plot and locales while stating that the acting was adequate.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n \n \n\n1937 mystery films\n1937 films\nAmerican mystery films\nRKO Pictures films\nAmerican black-and-white films\nFilms directed by Edward Killy\nFilms produced by Cliff Reid\nFilms produced by Samuel J.

It is situated in the south of the county on the R262 regional road,  west of Donegal Town. The local Catholic Church is St. Mary's, located on the main street.\n\nHistory\nThe name of the village is said to come from the Irish for \"showers\", which refers to food that fell from the sky and saved locals during the famine.\nThe first chapel in the village was reportedly built in 1780, and completed in 1808. The bell tower was added to the church in 1892.\n\nAmenities\nThe village contains a community hall, a montessori, grocery shop, hairdressers, coffee stall, printing shop, and a restaurant and B&B.\n\nTransport\nThe village is served by the 490 bus.\n\nNotable people\nMary Coughlan, former T\u00e1naiste, has lived in Frosses.\n\nSee also\n List of populated places in Ireland\n\nReferences\n\nTowns and villages in County Donegal", "Carlo J. Caparas' Panday or simply Panday () is a Philippine fantasy television series on ABS-CBN. The pilot episode of the first book (Panday: Unang Yugto) aired on November 7, 2005, replacing Ikaw ang Lahat sa Akin and ended with its last episode on December 9, 2005. The second book (Panday: Ang Ikalawang Yugto) aired its pilot episode on April 3, 2006, ended with the series finale on May 26, 2006, and was replaced by Calla Lily. The series is based on the fictional comics character of the same name, which was created by Carlo J. Caparas and illustrated by Steve Gan.\n\nBackground\nPanday literally means \"the blacksmith\". Ang Panday is the TV adaptation of the Fernando Poe Jr. film series Ang Panday from the early 1980s. It is about a blacksmith who made an enchanted sword that gives him special powers to battle the dark forces.\n\nSome of the location shots were taken in a remote town in Bohol, where the beach is white. Locals called it \"colgate-white\".\n\nPlot\nA meteor crashes into the desert of Sto. Sepulcro. The town blacksmith, Flavio, forges a dagger and a churchbell from the remains of the meteor. He uses the dagger to fight off the evil Sombra Oscura, who constantly attacks the town. By some mystical power, the dagger transforms into a great sword every time Flavio wields it.\n\nIn his final battle against evil, the Panday faces off against Lizardo, the son of Rodgin and the leader of the Sombras. The battle is intense, but Flavio prevails in the end, vanquishing Lizardo.\n\nHaving saved Sto. Sepulcro, Flavio decides to give up his sword. He goes to the church and casts his fabled weapon into the bell he also made. A white light then shoots out from the sky, and it lifts up Panday into the heavens.\n\nThe people of Sto. Sepulcro rejoice now that Panday has brought them peace. Unbeknownst to them, the Sombras discover that there is a part of Lizardo that is still alive \u2014 his brain.\n\nTo bring him back to life, they must transcend time and space to look for the girl who can resurrect their master.\nIn that time, Tristan, (played by Jericho Rosales) as the town's blacksmith, forges another sword with the same Flavio created.\n\nCast and characters\n\nMain cast\nJericho Rosales as Tristan/Panday\nHeart Evangelista as Eden/Camia\n\nSupporting cast\nVictor Neri as Lizardo\nNante Montreal as Tata Selo\nJulio Pacheco as Utoy\n\nUnang Yugto characters\n\nWorld 1\nPhillip Salvador as Flavio/Panday\nMarianne dela Riva as Esmeralda\nNante Montreal as Tata Selo\nRoldan Aquino as Mang Emong\nChris Vertido as Padre Damian\nShyr Valdez as Lolita\nChen Zenhric Dimayuga as Diego\nIan de Leon as Domingo\nChristopher Roxas as Julio\nNeri Naig as Florentina\nEva Darren as Nana Selo\nBea Nicolas as Henia\nJoe Gruta as Misteryosong Matanda\nJoshua Dionisio as Boyet\nMico Palanca as Alfred\nMike Austria as Mr. Roxas\nVivian Foz as Mrs. Roxas\nMichaela Espinosa as Danica\n\nIkalawang Yugto characters\n\nWorld 2\nDerek Ramsay as Kahimu\nMonsour del Rosario as Kaupay\nLevi Ignacio as Kahuyo\nDan Fernandez as Kabuog\nApreal Tolentino as Suruguon\nJeni Hernandez as Madalagan\nAshley Silverio as Mabaysay\nVanessa Gomez as Masayawon\nMaricar Fernandez as Makantahon\nDiana Dayao as Matawahon\n\nWorld 3\nKristine Hermosa as Camia\nPaw Diaz as Dahlia\nAnna Larrucea as Magnolia\nTanya Gomez as Violeta (past)\nErich Gonzales as Violeta (present)\nRafael Rosell as Calyptus\nEric Fructuoso as Gumma\nKetchup Eusebio as Orkido\n\nVillains\n\nUnang Yugto villains\n\nWorld 1\nRommel Montano as Socur\nMon Confiado as Magnus\nLevi Ignacio as Feirrus\nPaul Guzman as Rusticus \nAleck Bovick as Lady Feirrus\n\nIkalawang Yugto villains\n\nWorld 2\nDimples Romana as Manaram\nMichelle Bayle as Andam\n\nWorld 3\nVictor Neri as Jiamondo\nCarlos Agassi as Jaffir\nJeremiah Rosales as Emer\nBernard Palanca as Kamatayan\n\nProduction\n\nCasting\nIn June 2005, Heart Evangelista was cast as Eden, the love interest of Tristan, after a two-month-long auditioning process was conducted by ABS-CBN.\n\nReception\nAccording to AGB Neilsen, the pilot episode of Ang Panday gained an impressive of 44.7% national ratings, winning against its rival Encantadia.\n\nSee also\nFantaserye and telefantasya\nList of shows previously aired by ABS-CBN\nList of dramas of ABS-CBN\nAng Panday (2016 TV series)\nAng Panday (2017 film)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nPanday\n2005 Philippine television series debuts\n2006 Philippine television series endings\nABS-CBN drama series\nFantaserye and telefantasya\nFilipino-language television shows\nTelevision series by Star Creatives\nTelevision shows based on comics\nTelevision shows set in the Philippines", "O Pr\u00e9mio Satellite de melhor ator coadjuvante \u00e9 um dos Satellite Awards para o cinema que s\u00e3o concedidos anualmente pela International Press Academy.\n\nD\u00e9cada de 1990 \n\nMelhor ator coadjuvante em filme de drama\n 1996 - Armin Mueller-Stahl - Shine\n 1997 - Burt Reynolds - Boogie Nights\n 1998 - Donald Sutherland - Without Limits\n 1999 - Harry J.

The Christian Munsee are also known as the Moravian Munsee or the Moravian Indians, the Moravian Christian Indians or, in context, simply the Christian Indians. As the Moravian Church transferred some of their missions to other Christian denominations, such as the Methodists, Christian Munsee today belong to the Moravian Church, Methodist Church, United Church of Canada, among other Christian denominations.\n\nThe Christian Munsee tribe has produced several people who have become notable figures in Christianity and the Delaware Nation as a whole, such as Gelelemend (a Lenape chief), John Henry Kilbuck (a Moravian Christian missionary to the Native peoples in Alaska), Papunhank (a Moravian Lenape diplomat and preacher), Glikhikan (Munsee chief, Moravian elder, and Christian martyr), and Washington Jacobs (a chief of the Moravian of the Thames reservation). \n\nPresent-day Christian Munsee communities include Moravian of the Thames, the Christian Munsee tribe in Kansas, and the Stockbridge\u2013Munsee Community.\n\nHistory\nStarting in the 1740s, the Moravian Church sent out Christian missionaries to American Indian tribes and started settlements, with full tribal support. The ranks of the Christian Munsee thus include influential Lenape chiefs from the start. The Moravian Christian approach was to preserve Lenape cultural practices while passing on to the Lenape the Gospel message with the entirety of the Christian faith. As such, Moravian Christian missionaries developed the orthography for Lenape dialects and David Zeisberger \"compiled dictionaries of various Native tongues, translating them into English and German\".\n\nMid-Atlantic states and Ohio\nThe Munsee were the Wolf Clan of the Lenape, occupying the area where present-day New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey meet. The first recorded European contact occurred in 1524, when Giovanni da Verrazzano sailed into what is now New York Harbor. Like most native peoples of the Atlantic coast, the Munsee were quickly devastated by European diseases such as smallpox and influenza, and those who survived were forced inland. By the mid-18th century, one group of Lenape people began to follow the teachings of the Moravian missionaries. The Moravians were descended from the exiled Protestants from Morava, now Czech Republic, who founded a Protestant denomination from Herrnhut in the Germann state of Saxony. They sought to protect their converts by creating separate mission villages in the frontier, apart from both European settlers and from other native people. \n\nThe most prominent missionary among the Munsee was David Zeisberger. In 1772, he led his group of Christian Munsee to the Ohio Country, which he hoped would isolate them from the hostilities of the approaching American Revolution. However, in 1782, a force of Pennsylvania militiamen, in search of Indians who had been raiding settlements in western Pennsylvania, happened upon a group of ninety-six of Zeisberger's Christian Munsee harvesting corn, and rounded them up in the eastern Ohio village of Gnadenh\u00fctten. Although the Munsee truthfully pleaded their innocence and explained their non-combatant, nonresistant Christian convictions, the militia took a vote and decided to kill them all, including the women and children; these faithful are known as the Moravian Christian Indian Martyrs.\n\nWhile the American militiamen murdered the Moravian Christian Indians in Gnadenhutten, a messenger sent by the Moravian missionaries in Sandusky on March 3 reached Schoenbrunn on March 6 in order to deliver the news that all of them would be moving to Detroit; two of the Moravian Indians from Schoenbrunn went to inform their brethren in Gnadenhutten but on their journey there, they saw that the American soldiers had mangled body of Joseph Schebosh Jr, a Moravian with a European father and Indian mother. They buried his body and quickly returned to warn their brethren in Schoenbrunn as they thought that the others at Gnadenhutten met the same fate. For this reason, the Moravian Christian Indians at Schoenbrunn were able to flee to Sandusky before the American militiamen could advance from Gnadenhutten to Schoenbrunn, where they planned to commit another massacre.\n\nIn 1798, David Zeisberger led many of the Moravian Christian Indians back to Ohio, where they established the Goshen Mission near Schoenbrunn; there, Zeisberger lived until he peacefully died after which many of the Moravian Christian Indians moved to Ontario (cf. Delaware Nation at Moraviantown) and others to Kansas, along with Christian missionaries who continued to live and work among them. The descendants of both Jacob and Ester, the children of Israel Welapachtshechen (who was martyred in the Gnadenhutten massacre), make up the majority of the Christian Munsee tribe in Kansas today. In 1903, the Moravian Christians transferred the Christian Munsee mission in Moraviantown to Methodist Christians, a denomination that eventually joined the United Church of Canada, a United Protestant denomination to which many Christian Munsee belong to today.\n\nOntario\nAfter ten more years of strife, most of the Christian Munsee followed Zeisberger to Ontario, Canada, where they established a new home at Fairfield, commonly known as Moraviantown, along the Thames River. There they lived in relative peace for twenty years, supporting themselves with their farming and industry. However, once again they became unwitting victims of war, when American soldiers burned their village to the ground during the War of 1812 Battle of the Thames. The battle is well known historically as a victory for General William Henry Harrison, and for the death of the Shawnee chief Tecumseh, but the destruction of Moraviantown is little more than a footnote. The Munsee fled into the wilderness for safe haven until hostilities had ceased, then returned to build a new Fairfield across the Thames River to the south, which is now known as Moraviantown. In 1903, the Moravian Christians transferred the Christian Munsee mission in Moraviantown to Methodist Christians, a denomination that eventually joined the United Church of Canada, a United Protestant denomination to which many Christian Munsee belong to today.\n\nWisconsin\nBy the 1830s, a faction of the Christian Munsee favored a move to the American West. In 1837, some of the Munsee from Fairfield journeyed to Wisconsin to join another Christian band of Indians, the Stockbridge Indians, a combination of the last remnants of the Mohican and Wappinger peoples of the east bank of the Hudson, whence the two tribes became known collectively as the Stockbridge-Munsee. They are now the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Shawano County, Wisconsin. However, most of the Munsee eventually returned to Canada. The Christian Munsee in southern Ontario remain today as the Moravian of the Thames and the Munsee-Delaware Nation.\n\nKansas\nA small band of Christian Munsee decided to migrate again, this time to Kansas Territory, to join their non-Christian Lenape kinsmen. They settled first in Wyandotte County, then Leavenworth County. A few families settled near Fort Scott in Bourbon County. By 1857, most of the other Lenape (of Kansas) were removed to Indian Territory.\n\nThe Christian Munsee, who now numbered less than one hundred, chose to purchase a new reservation in Franklin County from a small band of Ojibwa (Chippewa) that had migrated from Michigan. The Treaty of 1859 officially combined the Swan Creek and Black River Band Chippewa and the Christian Munsee on a reservation of twelve square miles along the Marais des Cygnes River near the town of Ottawa. Signing the treaty for the Munsee were Henry Donohoe, Ignatius Caleb, and John Williams.\n\nAlthough the two tribes shared a reservation and were considered one tribe by the United States government in all dealings, they maintained their separate identities in cultural and religious practices. The Moravian church continued to send missionaries to the Munsee.\n\nUnder the Dawes Act, the Chippewa-Christian Indian Reservation, as it was known in the 1859 treaty, was allotted to the individual members and descendants of the tribes in separate 160-acre plots.  The people eventually accepted assimilation. In 1900, the final disbursement of federal funds was paid, and all benefits and official recognition as Native Americans were dissolved. A number of the Christian Munsee Tribe in Kansas live on the reservation in Ottawa, Kansas where they cling to their Christian faith and Lenape heritage.\n\nNotable members of the Christian Munsee tribe\nThe Christian Munsee tribe has produced several people who have become notable figures in both Christianity and the Delaware Nation as a whole:\n\nGelelemend, Lenape chief of the Turtle clan\nJohn Henry Kilbuck, Moravian Christian missionary to the Native peoples in Alaska\nPapunhank, a Moravian Christian Lenape diplomat and preacher\nGlikhikan, Munsee chief, Moravian Christian elder, and Moravian Christian martyr\n96 Moravian Christian Indian Martyrs, who practiced nonresistance as they were murdered in the Gnadenhutten massacre on 8 March 1782\nWashington Jacobs, chief of the Moravian of the Thames reservation.\n\nSee also\nPraying Indians\nMission Indians\nIndian Reductions\n\nReferences\n\nCensus of the Chippewa and Christian Indians, June 30, 1893.

Nickerie's capital city is Nieuw-Nickerie. Another town is Wageningen. The district borders the Atlantic Ocean to the north, the Surinamese district of Coronie to the east, the Surinamese district of Sipaliwini to the south and the region of East Berbice-Corentyne in Guyana to the west.\n\nNickerie has a population of 36.639 (2004) and an area of 5,353\u00a0km2. Nickerie's population includes East Indian, Javanese, Afro-Surinamese, Chinese, and Europeans.\n\nNickerie is bordered with Guyana. There is no bridge between the countries, but there is a ferry that sails between Molson Creek in Guyana and South Drain.\n\nHistory\nNickerie District was originally settled by Amerindians. Near the Wonotobo Falls, a settlement was discovered which dates from the 1st century BC. Between the 6th and 16th century some terpen (artificial mounts) were built in the coastal area of which Hertenrits is the best known. In 1613, a tobacco plantation was established on the Courantyne River, however it disappeared without a trace.\n\nIn 1718, Dietzel became the first person to successfully settle in the area. In 1797, governor Jurriaan Fran\u00e7ois de Friderici approved the first plantation in Nickerie. A large number of Scottish and English settlers arrived in the area during the British Occupation, and primarily grew cotton and coffee. The capital Nieuw Nickerie was built in 1879 after the former center of the district, Nieuw Rotterdam, was destroyed by floods.\n\nThe name Nickerie is probably based on Neekeari which was first reported by Teenstra in 1596 for an indigenous tribe living the area. The name also appears in Robert Dudley's The Voyage of Robert Dudley to the West-Indies, 1594-1595.\n\nNickerie had a poor connection to Paramaribo. It was not until 1960s when the East-West Link was constructed linking Nickerie with the rest of the country.\n\nResorts\n\n Groot Henar\n Nieuw Nickerie\n Oostelijke Polders\n Wageningen\n Westelijke Polders\n\nVillages\n Cupido\n Glasgow\n Hamptoncourtpolder\n Lokono Shikuabana\n Manchester\n Paradise\n South Drain\n\nAgriculture\n\nDuring the 19th century, Nickerie became home to many plantation. The abolition of slavery, transformed the area in smaller scale farming. In the late 19 century, many plantations start to  shift to balat\u00e1 production whose latex was used for driving belts and isolation, but started to become obsolete in the early 20th century. In 1955, a project of poldering started, resulting in an increase of cultivatable land.\n\nBananas and rice are the main crops grown in Nickerie. Some rice had been grown previously, but during the 20th century, Nickerie became the centre of the rice in Suriname, mainly due to the East Indian and Javanese indentured laborers.\n\nTourism\nNieuw Nickerie is started to develop as a tourist area. There are quite a number of hotels in the city, and the nearby Bigi Pan Nature Reserve opened opportunities for ecotourism. In 1972, the Hertenrits Nature Reserve was founded. In the reserve there are five terpen (artificial mounts). They were located in the middle of the swamp, and remains from the pre-Columbian era had been discovered in the mounts. Hertenrits has been incorporated into the Bigi Pan reserve.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Nickerie.nl\n Nickerie.net\n \n \n\n \nDistricts of Suriname", "Zhao Qi (died 201), courtesy name Binqing, was an official and scholar who lived during the Eastern Han dynasty of China.

In 1861, the two dowagers empresses chose Li Hongzao, Qi Junzao, and Weng Xincun, who were all Imperial teachers, to instruct the newly enthroned Tongzhi Emperor in the classics. The Emperor, who was less than five years old at the time, displayed little or no interest in his studies, and would concentrate only when Li was instructing him. Li rose to be vice-president of the Board of Revenue and Grand Councilor, and in 1872 became head of the Board of Works.

In 1884, Li and all the Grand Councillors, such as Yixin, who had been supported by the Empress Dowager, Cixi, were dismissed in a dispute with a group of conservative officials.

The film revolves around the lives of eight main characters, played by Riz Ahmed, Ed Skrein, Keef Coggins, Lee Allen, Nick Sagar, Ryan De La Cruz, Anouska Mond and Natalie Press, and features six original songs by Plan B, which act as a narration for the film. Ill Manors is a multi-character story, set over the course of seven days, a scenario where everyone is fighting for respect. The film focuses on the violence that surrounds the main characters as they struggle to survive on the streets. Each story is also represented by a different rap song performed by Plan B.\n\nCast\n\nProduction\nPrior to writing the script for Ill Manors, when Plan B was 21 years old, he had originally tried to begin production on another script he had written called Trigger, which was based on an incident where his home was raided by armed police. However, he was refused funding as he was an inexperienced director. To gain the necessary experience, Plan B wrote and directed his own short film Michelle in 2008 which was financed by himself with \u00a34000 from the remaining recording advance from his record label and an inheritance from his grandfather.\n\nThe short film, which starred Anouska Mond, Ed Skrein and Adam Deacon, was released online and acted as a pilot for the feature film Ill Manors, which Plan B had completed the script for within four months of making Michelle. He also directed the music video for \"Pieces\", his collaboration with Chase & Status, and also had roles in Adulthood (2008) and Harry Brown (2009). The script for Ill Manors was partly based on actual events and stories Plan B had heard when he was young, such as a woman prostituting herself in order to repay a drug dealer. The film had been in development for three years prior to filming; however, Drew struggled to secure finance for his film. Ill Manors was greenlit for production in 2009 as part of the Film London Microwave scheme.\n\nFor the film, Plan B hired a mixture of experienced and inexperienced actors, while several cast members already knew the director personally before they were cast in their roles. Riz Ahmed, who had previously recorded \"Shifty\" with Plan B, asked to play the lead role of Aaron after reading the script. Ed Skrein was a childhood friend of Plan B who had appeared in Michelle and had previously collaborated with him on numerous recordings.\n\nKeef Coggins is Plan B's godfather and Anouska Mond, who had also previously appeared in Plan B's short film was invited to audition for her previous role as Michelle. The main casting process for the film took place during August 2010 with several cast members being young unknown actors from the East End of London, such as Ryan De La Cruz who was discovered when the crew visited Rokeby School in Canning Town, London.\n\nPrincipal photography began on 1 September 2010 at 3 Mills Studios, London and filming lasted for four weeks on location in London, England. Plan B has named the 1996 film Pusher directed by Nicolas Winding Refn as a major influence on Ill Manors, as well as directors Shane Meadows and Quentin Tarantino. During production of the film, it was reported that the cast and crew ran into trouble with youths in Forest Gate, London and production was interrupted while a laptop containing the film's dailies had to be recovered after being stolen by a drug addict. Drew claimed that he faced prejudice from some crew members while on set; however, he also noted that \"there was some people that really believed in my vision and gave me all the support I needed.\"\n\nEditing of the film began in December 2010, but post-production of the film was delayed due to Plan B performing on The Defamation of Strickland Banks Tour during 2010 and 2011. To raise funds for the completion of the film's post-production, the distribution rights to Ill Manors were sold to Revolver Entertainment in April 2011 and Plan B delayed the release date of his planned third studio album The Ballad of Belmarsh until after Ill Manors was released.\n\nRelease\nThe trailer for Ill Manors was first aired on The Guardian's website on 3 May 2012, while the first film poster was first unveiled by Empire magazine's website on 8 May 2012. Digital Spy also unveiled two further promotional posters on 18 May and 7 June 2012. The premiere took place on 30 May 2012 at the Empire cinema in Leicester Square, London. This screening was also attended by several British recording artists such as Alesha Dixon, Alexandra Burke, Professor Green, Tinie Tempah, Wretch 32, Example and Ed Sheeran.\n\nThe film was given a wide release to 191 cinemas in both Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom by Revolver Entertainment on 6 June 2012. Ill Manors was released in the Netherlands on 30 August 2012 by Benelux Film Distributors and was also screened at the Toronto International Film Festival and the Festival do Rio in September 2012. Ill Manors was released on DVD on 8 October 2012, and contains footage that was not broadcast at cinemas.\n\nReception\nOn its opening weekend, the film placed at number nine at the UK Box Office, with a gross figure of \u00a3256,288. Domestically, the film has earned a total gross of \u00a3453,570, after eight weeks at the box office. Ill Manors has received largely positive reviews from critics and fans alike, with a current 80% \"fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on thirty different reviews.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nSee also \n List of hood films\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n  \n Film London Microwave site \n \n \n \n \n\n2012 films\n2012 crime drama films\n2010s gang films\nBBC Film films\nBritish crime drama films\nBritish gangster films\nFilms about drugs\nFilms about murderers\nFilms about prostitution in the United Kingdom\nBlack British mass media\nBlack British cinema\nBlack British films\nFilms directed by Plan B (musician)\nFilms set in London\nFilms shot in London\nForest Gate\nHood films\n2012 directorial debut films\n2010s English-language films\n2010s American films\n2010s British films", "George Waddel Snedecor (October 20, 1881 \u2013 February 15, 1974) was an American mathematician and statistician. He contributed to the foundations of analysis of variance, data analysis, experimental design, and statistical methodology. Snedecor's F-distribution and the George W. Snedecor Award of the American Statistical Association are named after him.\n\nEarly life\nBorn in Memphis, Tennessee, into a socially prominent and politically powerful, southern Democratic, Presbyterian family line, Snedecor grew up in Florida and Alabama where his lawyer father moved wife and children in order to fulfill a personal and radical religious calling to minister to, evangelize and educate the poor.  George was the grandson of Memphis lawyer Bedford Mitchell Estes, he was the son of Emily Alston Estes and James G. Snedecor, and nephew of Ione Estes Dodd and William J. Dodd, the midwest architect.\n\nEducation and career\nSnedecor studied mathematics and physics at Auburn University and University of Alabama, where he graduated with a BS in 1905. After taking up teaching jobs at Selma Military Academy and Austin College in Sherman, Texas, he continued his study in physics at the University of Michigan, where he received an MSc in 1913.\n\nSnedecor moved to the Iowa State University in 1913, where he became a professor in mathematics. He founded the first academic department of statistics in the United States, at Iowa State University in 1947. He also created the first statistics laboratory in the U.S. at Iowa State, and was a pioneer of modern applied statistics in the US. His 1938 textbook Statistical Methods became an essential resource: \"In the 1970s, a review of citations in published scientific articles from all areas of science showed that Snedecor's Statistical Methods was the most frequently cited book.\"\n\nSnedecor worked for the statistics department of Foster's Group from 1957 to 1963. He was involved in the elaboration of all production data.\n\nThe \"F\" of Snedecor's F distribution is named in honor of Sir Ronald Fisher.\n\nSnedecor was awarded honorary doctorates in science by North Carolina State University in 1956 and by Iowa State University in 1958.\n\nSnedecor Hall, at Iowa State University, is the home of the Statistics Department. It was constructed in 1939. At Iowa State, he was an early user of John Vincent Atanasoff's Atanasoff\u2013Berry computer (maybe the first user of an electronic digital computer for real world production mathematics problem solutions).\n\nSelected publications\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\nGeorge W.

Basic CFS files are compatible with ISO files. It is intended to be similar enough to ISO-9660 that many systems and applications will be able to read CFS, and other applications will require only minor modifications. It is based on: \n\n ISO-9660\n Joliet (file system)\n ISO-9660:1999\n Compact ISO\n\nIt is available for use in free or commercial applications without charge. It is supposed that no parts of the format are covered by patents. \n\nThe primary application is expected to be container files for various archiving and distribution applications, but CFS may be useful when written directly to CD/DVD media.\n\nGoals \n  Simplify use with data compression and with non seeking storage (pipes, sockets, tape).\n  Simplify implementation of read and write applications compared to traditional ISO-9660/UDF based images.\n  Improved consistency and interchange of data between different applications.\n  Simplify implementation of applications that modify images.\n  Increase storage efficiency by using less image space for media structures and duplicated directory data.\n  Eliminate the folder count limitation imposed in ISO-9660 by the path table.\n  Eliminate the file size limitations imposed by various compatibility restrictions with use of ISO-9660 and UDF.\n\nMain differences of CFS from ISO-9660 \n  The layout and contents of the media header (first 40k) is fixed, always containing the same sequence of volume structures and data.\n  All file names and text fields are stored as big-endian UCS-2, as specified in the Joliet extensions.\n   Arbitrary limitations on file name and directory depth are removed, up to the limitations of the ISO-9660 file record structure, 110 16 bit characters.\n  All directory data is written after the last block of file data.\n  Readers are expected to handle files over 4GB in size.\n  Path tables are optionally generated but are not used.\n\nTechnical Information\n\nMedia header \n\nThe first 20 blocks (40K) of the logical image is the media header. The layout of the media header is compatible with the various descriptor and directory structures for ISO-9660. The first block of file data is stored in block 20, immediately following the media header.\n\nThe media header has the following layout:\n block 0-11\n    all zero\n block 12\n    compatibility readme file text\n block 13\n    compatibility root folder\n block 14\n    compatibility little-endian path table\n block 15\n    compatibility big-endian path table\n block 16\n   ISO-9660 compatibility primary volume descriptor\n block 17\n   ISO-9660 supplementary volume descriptor\n block 18\n   ISO-9660 terminating descriptor\n block 19\n   all zero \nThe primary volume descriptor in the media header references the fixed compatibility root folder and readme, to help users identify applications and systems that do not use the supplementary volume descriptor. The supplementary volume descriptor indicates the UCS-2 character set and references the real directory structure. The media header should be initialized exactly as is done in the logic in this header file. No additional application data, system data, comments, dates, text, etc., should be added to the media header.\n\nUnicode file names \n\nAll file names and the system ID and volume ID fields of the supplementary volume descriptor are encoded as UCS-2, big-endian.\n\nFile name lengths are limited by the 8 bit file record size to 110 16 bit characters.\nNo arbitrary limits are imposed on directory hierarchy depth or combined length of a file name and included folder name components. Readers will need to choose an appropriate limit for their environment and perform checks as necessary. As in ISO-9660-1999, version numbers are not added to file names. As in ISO-9660-1999, special meaning of the '.' and ';' characters during file name sorting is eliminated.\n\nOptional path tables \n\nPath tables consume media space with redundant information, and restrict media to a maximum of 64k folders. Readers should not reference path tables. Writers may choose to generate path tables to increase compatibility with ISO-9660 readers. Path tables must be written with the directory data (folder extents), beyond the last block of file data. Note that correct path tables cannot be generated for media containing more than 64K folders. Writers that are modifying an existing media may choose to remove existing path tables. If path tables are not present then the three related volume descriptor fields in the supplementary volume descriptor must be set to zero.\n\nExtended attributes \n\nExtended attributes are reserved for future extensions to CFS. Writers must not create extended attributes. Readers must gracefully handle extended attributes if they exist. File data must be contiguous, and restricted use of duplicate file records for multi-extent files. All data for each file must exist in one contiguous extent. This is true even when the files are represented using multiple file records. Interleaved files must not be created. Associated files must not be created.\n\nDuplicate file records are to be used only to allow representing files with data extents that are larger than 4GiB-2048. Duplicate file records are not to be used to represent files with fragmented data. When duplicate file records are used, the multi-extent flag must also be used as indicated in ISO-9660-1999 specification. Duplicate file records should not be created unless the total data size of the file is greater than 4Gib-2048. When duplicate file records exist for a file, all but the last file record must have a data extent that is exactly 4Gib-2048 bytes in size.\n\nLocation of directory data on media \n\nAll file data must precede all folder extents and path tables on media. The intent is that an image modifying application can read the entire directory into memory, add new file data to the image, and rewrite an updated directory after the new file data. Writers will need to determine the last block of file data after reading the entire directory.\n\nMedia header patch area \n\nWhen the media header is modified, either at the end of image creation or as part of later modifications to an existing image, only some specific fields are to be updated. These fields exist entirely within the media header patch area. Only the media header patch area should be re-written. This allows more options when dealing with image container file formats or transports with limited seeking or overwrite capability (compressed formats, pipes, sockets).\n\nFormat extensions and compound file systems \n\nAll files and folders written in the image must be accessible through the single directory structure referenced from the supplementary volume descriptor. Compound file systems, such as including UDF or HFS structures, are not allowed. Rockridge and other ISO-9660 extensions are not allowed.\n\nExtensions for archiving system specific attributes \n\nFuture versions of CFS may include extensions to allow storing system specific attributes such as time fields, security descriptors, access control lists, resource forks, symbolic links etc.. Developers with a need for these extensions should contact Pismo Technic with requirements and/or suggestions.\n\nMedia formats\n\nCFS images are either written to CD/DVD media, or are stored in a media container file. The media container file can be a raw dump of the CFS image, referred to here as DD, but more commonly known as ISO files. Also, the media container file can be a more structured container format that provides additional features such as compression and spanning. CFS images are only compliant with this specification when they are stored in DD or CISO (Compact ISO) format media files. When burned to CD/DVD media or when stored in other media container file formats such as NRG or DAA, the combination is not CFS compliant and should not be referred to as a CFS file.\n\nNote: Compact ISO is not the same format as the [[compressed ISO]] format common in PlayStation Portable homebrew development. The PSP compressed ISO format is also referred to as CISO, but the file extension is CSO.\n\nCFS writing applications should default to writing DD format media container files unless the user has specified container file options that require CISO (spanning, compression, ...). This provides more intuitive interchange with systems and applications that support DD CD/DVD images but do not support CFS.\n\nSee also \n\nComparison of archive formats\nList of archive formats\nFree file format\nOpen format\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n CFS, Compact File Set at Pismo Technic\n\nArchive formats", "Snow Time, also known as Alaska Daze in some reissues, is a 1932 animated short film distributed by Columbia Pictures, part of the Krazy Kat series.\n\nPlot\nIt is winter time and Krazy is in his horse-drawn sleigh, running through the snowy outdoors. Next, he stops over at the house of his spaniel girlfriend. Krazy then calls and invites her to go out with him. Showing herself through a window, the spaniel discloses she cannot come outside because her door is blocked by thick snow. In this, Krazy and his horse goes on to clear the doorway. In just a short while, the impeding snow has been removed, and the spaniel finally steps out. They then head off in the sleigh.\n\nKrazy and the spaniel arrive at their destination, the frozen lake. They then put on their ice skates and set foot on the ice. For several moments, things are going very smooth for them. Their movements are fluent and they never stumble into things. This is until Krazy crashes into a wooden barrel and starts to lose control. He then overshoots the edge of the lake and gets himself into a snowy slope. As he tumbles down the slope, Krazy becomes covered in snow and immediately becomes a large rampaging snowball. The snowball bashes a cabin and rolls into a barn where it runs over the farm animals. Finally, it spatters onto a larger house, and Krazy is free at last. Just nearby him is the spaniel who is relieved to know he is unharmed. Without further ado, they continue looking for ways to spend time in the frosty landscape.\n\nAvailability\nColumbia Cartoon Collection: Volumes 3 and 12.\n\nSee also\n Krazy Kat filmography\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSnow Time at the Big Cartoon Database\n\n1932 short films\n1932 animated films\nAmerican black-and-white films\nKrazy Kat shorts\nColumbia Pictures short films\nAmerican animated short films\n1930s American animated films\nFigure skating films\nFilms set in Alaska\nColumbia Pictures animated short films\nScreen Gems short films", "Vyrytovo () is a rural locality (a village) in Demidovskoye Rural Settlement, Gus-Khrustalny District, Vladimir Oblast, Russia.

With financial problems at the club ongoing, the summer began for Rangers with several players leaving the club. With a limited transfer budget and a small squad. Walter Smith had to decide whether to increase the number of playing staff or improve the starting eleven, he opted for quality.\n\nBoth sides of the Old Firm began the season with eight league wins in a row, however, with the sides meeting on matchday nine something had to give. Rangers claimed a 3\u20131 victory over Celtic and took early control of the league. A 1\u20131 draw at home to Inverness CT the following weekend ended Rangers 100% start to the season and a home defeat to Hibernian inflicted the team's first league defeat of the season, the first of five. The cold spell in the winter of 2010\u201311 saw many postponements and for long spells Rangers were behind Celtic but with games in hand. In the third league meeting between the Old Firm, Celtic came out on top and mathematical lead the table, for the first time that season. However Celtic's advantage was short lived after a loss to Motherwell the following week. This allowed Rangers to regain top spot, but 3\u20132 loss to Dundee United at Ibrox followed by a 0\u20130 draw in the final Old Firm fixture left the title in Celtic's hands, with just four matches remaining. There was to be a final twist in the league season, on 3 May Celtic lost a rearranged match away to Inverness and so with three matches remaining Rangers had a one-point lead. Smith's side went on to win all three fixtures, scoring 11 goals, and claimed the club's 54th league championship.\n\nIn the domestic cup competitions Rangers won the League Cup after beating Celtic 2-1 AET. However, Rangers lost 1\u20130 to Celtic in the fifth round replay in Scottish Cup. The match was marked by several incidents, three Rangers players were sent-off and Celtic manager Neil Lennon and McCoist were involved in a pitch side bust up.\n\nIn Europe, Rangers automatically qualified for the UEFA Champions League group stages for the second season in a row. They drew Manchester United, Valencia and Bursaspor. Rangers were unbeaten in their first three group stage games, with a 0\u20130 draw at Old Trafford, a 1\u20130 victory over Bursaspor at Ibrox and a 1\u20131 draw at home to Valencia. A 3\u20130 defeat in Spain to Valencia followed by a 1\u20130 loss at home to Manchester United ended Rangers chances of qualifying for the last 16, but third place and a spot in the UEFA Europa League was already secured with Bursaspor having failed to pick up a point in five games. In the last group match Rangers drew 1\u20131 in Turkey, giving Bursaspor their first Champions League point. However, Rangers did make it to the last 16 of the Europa League, beating Sporting Lisbon on away goals in the last 32 but lost to PSV Eindhoven on aggregate.\n\nOn 6 May 2011, it was confirmed that David Murray had sold his controlling interest in the club (85.3%) to Wavetower limited for \u00a31, a company owned by businessman Craig Whyte.\n\nPlayers\n\nSquad information\n\nTransfers\n\nIn\n\nTotal spending: \u00a35.95m\n\nOut\n\nTotal income: \u00a34.4m\n\nNew contracts\n\nSquad statistics\n\nTop scorers\n\nLast updated: 15 May 2011\nSource: Match reports\nOnly competitive matches\n\nDisciplinary record\n\nLast updated: 15 May 2011\nSource: Match reports\nOnly competitive matches\n\nClub\n\nBoard of directors\n\nCoaching staff\n\nOther staff\n\nMatches\n\nScottish Premier League\n\nUEFA Champions League\n\nUEFA Europa League\n\nScottish Cup\n\nLeague Cup\n\nFriendlies\n\nCompetitions\n\nOverall\n\nScottish Premier League\n\nStandings\n\nResults summary\n\nResults by round\n\nUEFA Champions League\n\nGroup C\n\nReferences \n\nRangers F.C. seasons\nRangers\nScottish football championship-winning seasons\nRangers\nRangers", "Jordan Connor Yuen (born 17 September 1991) is a Canadian actor. He plays Sweet Pea in the television series Riverdale. He has also appeared in Looking for Alaska, Hospital Show and Nurses.\n\nEarly life \nConnor was born in Calgary but moved to Vancouver when he was two years old. He grew up in Delta, located in the Greater Vancouver area. Connor's father was born in Canada and is mostly of Chinese descent, mixed with Vietnamese, Thai, Indonesian, Samoan and more. His mother is from Croatia. According to a DNA test he did, he also has Eastern European, Spanish, Greek, Italian, German and Native American roots. He has a brother, Brad, and a sister, Nicole.\n\nConnor said he knew he wanted to be an actor since he was around 10\u201311 years old. Connor attended Sands Secondary School, where he did theatre and played football. His first performance was in his school's production of Guys and Dolls. After receiving a football scholarship to the University of British Columbia, Connor put acting aside to focus on football while he was studying architecture. During a game at the end of his second year, Connor broke his leg when he was tackled, ending his football career. Bedridden and unable to walk for three months, Connor became depressed. After his leg healed, Connor found work as a stuntperson when the show Hellcats came to his football team seeking stuntpeople. Rediscovering his love for acting on the set, Connor continued doing stunt and background work for about a year.\n\nEventually, Connor left university to pursue acting more seriously. He began acting training at the Railtown Actors Studio in Vancouver. While training on and off for five years, Connor booked small parts and also worked in other jobs, including bartending at a restaurant, working for a marketing company and selling mobile phones. He also owned a theatre company with friends.\n\nCareer \nConnor's breakthrough role was as Sweet Pea in the television series Riverdale. Connor had auditioned for other characters such as Joaquin and Reggie before reading for Sweet Pea. First introduced in the show's second season (which premiered in October 2017), Connor was originally supposed to only have four episodes but his role was later expanded to a recurring role.\n\nIn March 2019, Connor was cast as Kevin in Looking for Alaska, a miniseries adaptation of John Green's novel. The series was released on Hulu on 18 October 2019. In 2019, Connor appeared in Hospital Show, a 10-part comedy web series which premiered on YouTube on 10 October 2019. In April 2020, Connor was one of the celebrity contestants in the first episode of RuPaul's Secret Celebrity Drag Race. Competing against Jermaine Fowler and Nico Tortorella, Connor won the episode, winning $30,000 for his charity of choice, Cystic Fibrosis Canada.\n\nIn August 2020, it was announced that Connor had joined the cast of Canadian medical drama series Nurses for its second season.\n\nPersonal life \nConnor and his long-term partner, Jinjara Mitchell, got engaged on 22 September 2018.

Rangers are skilled bushcraftsmen/woodcraftsmen, and often lived reclusive lives as hermits.\n\nPublication history\n\nCreative origins\nThe ranger was primarily based on the character Aragorn, and the Rangers of the North of J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth mythos, as warriors who use tracking and other wilderness skills to hunt down their enemies. The AD&D second edition handbook mentions several other inspirations from myth and legend, such as Robin Hood, Jack the Giant Killer, the huntress Diana, and the Greek hero Orion. Other notable rangers in the literature of Dungeons & Dragons include Hank from the cartoon series, King Tristan Kendrick from Forgotten Realms, and Ren from Pool of Radiance.\n\nOriginal Dungeons & Dragons\nThe ranger was introduced in The Strategic Review volume 1, number 2.\n\nAdvanced Dungeons & Dragons 1st edition\nThe ranger was one of the standard character-classes available in the original Player's Handbook, one of five subclasses. The first edition rangers were a subtype of the fighters, using any weapon and wearing any armor, but they gained extra attacks at a slower rate than fighters and paladins. Unlike other warriors, the ranger used d8 hit dice instead of d10s, but had a second hit die at 1st level and maxed out at 11 hit dice instead of nine. Rangers also had extensive tracking abilities, based on a percentage score, and were able to surprise opponents on a roll of 1\u20133 on a d6 (rather than a 1\u20132) while they themselves could only be surprised on a 1. Rangers gained limited spell use at level 8, acquiring 1st\u20133rd level druid spells and 1st and 2nd level magic-user spells (two per level maximum). Rangers were most effective when fighting giants and humanoids (such as orcs), gaining a +1 to damage per level against these opponents.\n\nHigh level rangers gained followers, ranging in type and power from classed player-character races, to creatures such as pegasus mounts, pseudodragons, werebears, copper dragons and storm giants. As a general rule, the fewer followers a ranger gained (based on random dice rolls) the more powerful each individual follower was. Rangers were required to be of good alignment, and were initially limited to humans and half-elves.  The only multi-class option open to rangers was the ranger/cleric, allowed to half-elves.\n\nBasic Dungeons & Dragons\nThe ranger was not available as a character class in the game's \"Basic\" edition. However, the Best of Dragon Magazine volumes 2\u20133 contained variant rules for rangers for this version, including spell lists, henchmen, and tracking ability.\n\nAdvanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd Edition\nRangers went through several changes in the 2nd edition. Their hit dice were changed to match fighters and paladins. Rangers could still wear any armor, but several of their new abilities required the use of light armor, including the skill to use two weapons without penalty and the thief-like abilities of move-silently and hide-in-shadows. The class retained its tracking abilities but the ability was based on a skill check instead of a percentage roll. Rangers also gained an animal empathy ability which allowed them to calm frightened or hostile animals. Instead of gaining a damage bonus against all giant and humanoid monsters, the ranger focused on a specific creature, which did not have to be of giant or humanoid stock. The class's spell abilities were also limited to 1st\u20133rd level priest spells from the plant and animal spheres. Higher level rangers could recruit various woodland animals, mythical creatures (such as the treant, pegasus, and pixie), and classed characters including druids, clerics, or other rangers as followers.\n\nAlthough Rangers were generally Good-aligned, an evil version was featured with the Paka, a race of shape-shifting feline humanoids native to Ravenloft who are hostile to mankind.\n\nDungeons & Dragons 3rd edition\nThe 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons saw more changes to the ranger. The species enemy was now called favored enemy, and the ranger was allowed to select additional enemies during advancement. The class retained its spellcasting ability, but gained it much earlier, and had its own spell list. The nature of the ranger's companions also changed significantly. Instead of gaining multiple followers the ranger gained a single animal companion, and at an earlier level than in previous editions. The race and alignment restrictions of the earlier editions were dropped, allowing evil rangers for the first time.\n\nDungeons & Dragons 4th edition\nRangers in the 4th edition retained their ability to specialize in archery or two weapon fighting. Rangers had the striker role, specializing in single-target damage, as well as mobility. They had the martial power source, and, like all martial classes, their powers were called exploits. Their special abilities made them better suited to hit and run tactics and focusing on a single opponent. Other abilities allowed the ranger to aid his companions with skill checks and avoiding ambushes.\n\nDungeons & Dragons Essentials\nThe Essentials rulebook Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms presented two alternate versions of the ranger, the hunter and the scout. The hunter focused on ranged attacks, while the scout focused on melee attacks.\n\nDungeons & Dragons 5th edition\nThe ranger was included as a character class in the 5th edition Player's Handbook (2014). Rangers are a half caster class in 5th edition, gaining limited spellcasting. Their features and spells focus on exploration, survival skills, and tracking foes. At third level, players chose from one of two ranger archetypes: the Hunter, and the Beast Master. The hunter archetype gains combative capabilities, while the beast master gains an animal companion to control. Several sourcebooks since the launch of 5th edition have expanded the number of ranger archetype options. Xanathar's Guide to Everything (2017) added three more ranger archetypes: the Gloom Stalker, Horizon Walker and Monster Slayer. The Gloom Stalker focuses upon hiding in areas of low light, the Horizon Walker gains access to certain teleportation features, and the Monster Slayer becomes adept at attacking certain studied foes. Tasha's Cauldron of Everything (2020) added two more archetypes: Fey Wanderer and Swarmkeeper.\n\nIn 2016, due to criticisms of the ranger as presented in the Player's Handbook (2014), the \"Revised Ranger\" class was released as part of the Unearthed Arcana playtest. This playtest version \"made some of the ranger's core abilities easier to use and specifically fixed how a ranger uses its animal companion, giving a ranger the animal at Level 3 and allowing a ranger to attack with both its weapon and the animal on the same turn\". However, this new version of the class is not legal for organized play such as in the Adventurer's League. Since the release of the \"Revised Ranger\", Jeremy Crawford, Co-Lead Designer of the 5th Edition, has reiterated multiple times that there no plans to release an official alternate version of the class. In November 2019, Wizards of the Coast released a new Unearthed Arcana titled Class Feature Variants, which added additional class features for all classes including the Ranger. These new class feature variants where introduced in 2020, with the release of Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, as optional rules, including an optional revision of the Beastmaster's companion feature.\n\nOne D&D\nPlaytesting for the next version of Ranger was announced. In September 2022, they released the Unearthed Arcana 2022 - Expert Classes playtest material for One D&D which included rules for playing a Ranger up to level 20, as well as the Hunter subclass.\n\nReception \nScreen Rant rated the ranger class as the least powerful class of the base 12 character classes in the 5th edition. \"The reason this class gets the lowest ranking is because it forces players to be kind of specific. Being able to have a favored enemy and terrain is kind of cool because the character gets all sorts of bonuses, but if the Ranger is good, say, in the Underdark fighting aberrations, but the DM has set the adventure in a desert ruin somewhere, well, those bonuses won't do much good. That being said, the Revised Ranger stats help balance this out a little bit. Players don't have to be as specific, but still\".\n\nIn 2018, Christian Hoffer, for ComicBook, wrote that \"many current D&D fans believe that the ranger class is the weakest in the game, due to a combination of poor class-specific abilities and weak damage output. The 'Beast Master' ranger subclass is the most criticized version of the ranger [...]. While not official, many fans preferred the Revised Ranger to the original Ranger class found in the Player's Handbook\". Hoffer also highlighted Crawford's reiteration that the ranger class would not change and wrote \"surprisingly, Crawford's comment became the flashpoint for tons of D&D debate over the weekend on various boards and forums, with players debating the merits of the core Ranger class and the revisions seemingly discarded by the D&D team. [...] Unless you're playing in an Adventurer's League game, it's ultimately up to the DM whether or not you can use the Revised Ranger rules. Homebrewing is extremely common in Dungeons & Dragons, and there's nothing stopping home games from using a Revised Ranger to their heart's content\". \n\nIn 2019, Jeremy Thomas, for 411Mania, wrote that \"the Ranger has long been a source of criticism for D&D players in Fifth Edition, who have argued that the Beast Master subclass in particular is underpowered. Wizards even released a Revised Ranger class, which would potentially be an optional take on the class and not replace the core version\". \n\nThe Gamer rated the 5th edition ranger subclass Horizon Walker as the 8th most awesome subclass out of the 32 new character options in Xanathar\u2019s Guide to Everything.\n\nGus Wezerek, for FiveThirtyEight, reported that of the 5th edition \"class and race combinations per 100,000 characters that players created on D&D Beyond from\" August 15 to September 15, 2017, rangers were the 6th most created at 8,887 total. Elf (3,076) was the most common racial combination followed by human (1,715) and then half-elf (891). Elf ranger was the second most created character out of all the class and race combinations.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\n Advanced Dungeons & Dragons First Edition Player's Handbook\n Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Second Edition Player's Handbook\n The Complete Fighter's Handbook\n The Complete Ranger's Handbook\n Dungeons & Dragons Third Edition Player's Handbook\n Dungeons & Dragons Fourth Edition Player's Handbook\n The Quintessential Ranger (Mongoose Publishing)\n The Quintessential Ranger II: Advanced Tactics (Mongoose Publishing)\n\nExternal links\n D&D Wiki has all the SRD Classes, along with the Ranger.\n\nDungeons & Dragons character classes\n\nhe:\u05d3\u05de\u05d5\u05d9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05de\u05d1\u05d5\u05db\u05d9\u05dd \u05d5\u05d3\u05e8\u05e7\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd", "Light Steam Power was a magazine dedicated to amateur and small-scale interest in steam power. Its masthead for some years described itself as, \"Authentic World News on Steam Power for Cars, Launches and Small Stationary Units\".\n\nPublishing history \nThe magazine was self-published by its editor John Ness Walton of Kirk Michael, Isle of Man. It began when he took over an earlier magazine, Steam Car Developments and Steam Marine Motors in 1945, renaming this in 1949. For most of its existence it was published bi-monthly, although the first and last volumes were published at three- and four-month intervals.\nIn its last years, from 1977 it changed its name to Steam Power and re-located to Loughborough. The magazine continued under this name until 1981.\n\nIn more recent years, there was a website maintaining the magazine's archives, but this has now gone. In 2009 an agreement was made with the National Steam Car Association for them to hold the rights to Light Steam Power and other Walton publications. Mr. Walton died March 19, 2013, aged 91.\n\nCoverage\nThe two main applications of steam power covered were steam cars and small steam launches. Much of the magazine's content was influenced, if not indeed written, by skilled and enthusiastic amateurs describing their own projects and so their choice of these projects influenced the magazine's own direction. Steam turbines and large steamships were less frequent, being beyond the constructional capacity of most readers, but they were described as news items when particularly interesting events took place. One aspect that oddly was only lightly covered was the use of steam on railways, unusually so as the magazine's heyday coincided with the demise of mainline steam but with increasing interest in the railway and steam preservation movements.\n\nThe magazine covered a broad range of topics within 'steam power', often at a far more advanced level than contemporary railway and steam locomotive practice. Low-water-content water-tube boilers were commonplace and even monotube steam generators and uniflow engines were regular features. Although the terms were not yet in use, these technical features coincided with increased recognition of the Advanced Steam Technology and Modern Steam movement.\n\nCoverage was always worldwide and international, even though this was unusual for any magazine at this time, let alone a small independent. Many articles were provided by Australian and Canadian builders.\n\nOther content \nAs well as the magazine content, it also included advertisements for other services from J.N. Walton such as engineering drawings for a range of related machinery, also castings for its construction. Walton also supplied the 'KleenHeet' waste oil burner.\n\nSimilar publications \nFrom 1965 a US publication, Steam Calliope: A Voice for the Steam Automobile was published in Panorama City, California by mechanical engineer Thomas P. Hall. It originated news and published clippings for western members of the Steam Automobile Club of America.\n\nThe Steam Automobile was the quarterly publication of the Steam Automobile Club of America and was published from 1959 to 1986.\nSteam Power was the quarterly of the Steam Power Club, a spinoff of the SACA in California. Its last issues were named Ssssteam. \n\nThe Steam Automobile Bulletin began in 1986 following a shift of editorial material to a commercial magazine. It continues as a bimonthly with anything technical and historic on steam between toys and locomotives, including steam cars.\n\nSee also \n Edward Pritchard, Australian engineer of light steam power\n\nReferences \n\nHobby magazines published in the United Kingdom\nEnergy magazines\nIndependent magazines\nDefunct magazines published in the United Kingdom\nMagazines established in 1949\nMagazines disestablished in 1981\n1949 establishments in the United Kingdom\n1981 disestablishments in the United Kingdom\nSteam power\nLive steam", "Tulosesus is a genus of fungi in the family Psathyrellaceae.\n\nTaxonomy \nThe Tulosesus genus was created in 2020 by the German mycologists Dieter W\u00e4chter & Andreas Melzer when the Psathyrellaceae family was subdivided based on phylogenetic analysis.

He was part of the Nkana Red Devils side of the 1980s, winning five league titles, and he also captained Zambia. As a coach, he won several Zambian Premier League titles and became the first coach to lead a Zambian club to the group phase of the CAF Champions' League.\n\nPlaying career\nSimukonda was born in Chingola where he started his football career with Division II side Mimbula Diggers as a defender. He later moved to Diggers' town mates KB Davies FC, another Division II team.\n\nStanding at over six feet tall, he was a commanding presence in defence and in 1980, was recruited by Division I side Vitafoam United where he lined up with players like Ronald Mkandawire, Lackson Chanda, Michael Chabala and Boniface 'Killer' Chanda. The following season, Simukonda captained Vitafoam to a 2\u20131 Independence Cup final victory over Strike Rovers.\n\nIn 1982, Vitafoam proprietor Abram Mokola decided to give some senior players the opportunity to acquire coaching skills so Simukonda was one of five who were sponsored for a coaching course in England in March of that year. His fine defensive play caught the attention of Kitwe giants who signed him soon after his return from England and Vitafoam claimed he had breached his contract with them. The contract dispute kept him out of action for almost four months until the two teams agreed a compensation package.\n\nHe had hardly joined Nkana when head coach Moses Simwala was suspended so Simukonda took charge of the team but he informed the club's management that while he was equal to the task, he was still an active player so Nkana great Stone Chibwe was brought in to hold fort. An astute defender who perfected a tackle called the 'Chitemene system' after the slash and burn method of preparing fields in Northern Zambia, Simukonda won his first league title with Nkana going unbeaten the whole season and would go on to win four more in 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988.\n\nIn the 1989 season, Nkana made it to the final of the Heroes and Unity Cup which was to be played at their home ground Nkana Stadium against Green Buffaloes on 9 July 1989. It seemed like an unfair advantage but Buffaloes were equal to the task and stunned the home side 1\u20130 via a late goal after Simukonda's mistake led to Christopher Chileshe's fierce drive which Nkana goalkeeper Dick Shonga failed to hold on to, allowing Donald Chandalala to stab the ball home. The Nkana team were so devastated by the loss of a game they had been expected to win that they collected their loser's medals and headed straight to the dressing rooms. This was interpreted as refusing to sing the national anthem so six of them were suspended, including Simukonda.\n\nSimukonda explained afterwards \"We did not refuse to sing the national anthem, we were just misunderstood. The dais was mounted near our dressing room so after collecting our losers' medals, we went straight to the dressing room to mourn our frustrations which authorities interpreted as refusing to sing the national anthem.\"\n\nWhile still serving the ban, Simukonda left the country to ply his trade in South Africa, becoming the third Zambian player after Albert Bwalya and John Mwanza to play in the ostracised country due to apartheid, which also meant that he did not need an international clearance.  He played for Jomo Cosmos for two years and then moved to Blackpool where he stayed for a season before joining Nelspruit-based Dangerous Darkies and played for them for a season and then ended his playing career.\n\nNational team\nSimukonda made his national team debut in October 1983 in an Olympic Games qualifier against Egypt in Lusaka which Zambia won 1\u20130 courtesy of a Peter Kaumba strike. From then on, he was a regular in the Zambian defence and was part of the team that won the country's first ever CECAFA Cup in Uganda in 1984 under Brightwell Banda.\n\nSimukonda was in the Zambian team that defeated Cameroon 4\u20131 in a World Cup qualifier in Lusaka in April 1985 but missed out on the second leg as Banda preferred a central defensive pairing of Jones Chilengi and John \"Butcher\" Mwanza, which stood firm in a 1\u20131 draw.\n\nHe was left out of Zambia's CAN 1986 squad but made a comeback in December 1986 when he captained the team to a 1\u20130 win over Angola to lift the MPLA trophy in Luanda. He continued as captain when Samuel Ndhlovu took over as coach the following year and was in the Zambian team that pulled off a 2\u20131 aggregate win over Ghana to qualify to the Seoul Olympic Games.\n\nThe suspension of Zambia for pulling out of hosting the 1988 CAN finals saw Simukonda missing another tournament and as the Olympic Games approached, the central defensive pairing of captain Simukonda and his deputy Ashols Melu came in for some criticism, particularly when Zambia were beaten 4\u20130 by South Korea at the President's Cup tournament. This led to Simukonda being dropped for Zambia's dead rubber match against the Italian U-21 side. The game against South Korea turned out to be his last game for his country so it meant missing out on another major tournament by the time the Olympic Games came round.\n\nCoaching career\nSimukonda took up coaching duties at Darkies in 1992 thanks to the course he had attended ten years prior to that. He made history when he took charge for part of the 1992 season with Darkies, managing a single win in 42 matches, conceding 122 goals in the process, which gave him the record of the worst coach in South African football history.\n\nHis dismissal at Darkies coincided with the re-admission of South Africa to the international fold so Simukonda returned to Zambia in 1992 and joined Roan United as assistant to Fordson Kabole, the man Simukonda describes as his mentor and when Kabole left Roan the following season to join Kabwe Warriors, Simukonda took over as head coach. Roan controversially lost to Mufulira Wanderers 4\u20130 in the 1994 final of the BP Top 8 Cup after conceding what looked like a couple of offside goals but they won the Mosi Cup and finished fourth on the log. He avenged Roan's defeat to Wanderers by beating the Mufulira side 3\u20130 in the following year's BP Top 8 Final and regained the Mosi Cup in 1996.\n\nHe was one of the assistant coaches at CAN 1998 where Zambia were knocked out in the first round and took charge of Zambia on an interim basis in 1998 and retained the COSAFA Cup but stepped down when Zambia drew their first CAN 2000 qualifier 1\u20131 against Congo DR in Lusaka.\n\nAfter a patchy run of form early in the 1999 season, Simukonda was given a four-match ultimatum to start winning, beginning with Roan's ninth league game of the season, which ended in a draw and left Roan ninth in the league standings with three wins, three losses and two draws. This prompted management to terminate his contract and replace him with Paul Mulenga.\n\nTwo months later, Simukonda moved to Konkola Blades in Chililabombwe, whose coach Benjamin Bwalya had died in February, and transformed the border-town outfit into the most exciting team in the league. In June 2000, Zambia coach Jan Brouwer watched Blades knock Nchanga Rangers out of the BP Top 8 semi-final, 1\u20130, and immediately called for Simukonda's services, saying the kind of game Blades had exhibited was the type of play that was expected of the national team and he regretted that the national team's performance was a far cry from Blades' superiority.\n\nBlades lost the final to Nkana, 6\u20131, and in 2002, Simukonda turned down the chance to coach Warriors where he would have had the opportunity of working with some of the biggest names in the league, to stay at Konkola Stadium, despite losing six key players including captain Kunda Mushota, John Munkonje, Aaron Kale and international Vincent Mangamu. \"I have to show what I am made of. I have been through this before at Roan,\" he said.\n\nAfter several mid-table finishes, Blades' style of play compelled Zanaco to lure him to the capital city in January 2004 on a two-year deal and his departure was lamented by Blades Secretary Remmy Ngosa who said \"He is a very good coach. We will miss his services greatly.\"\n\nSimukonda won back-to-back league titles at Zanaco in 2005\u201306 and won the coach of the year award in the process but when Zanaco failed to win a third successive premier league title, the club dispensed of Simukonda\u2019s services but City of Lusaka hired him in 2007. He served as assistant coach to Patrick Phiri at CAN 2008 though he moved to Lusaka Dynamos and laid down the ghosts of the 2000 final when he won the club its first ever trophy, the BP Top 8 Cup in 2008 with a 1\u20130 win over ZESCO United, the team which he joined in January 2009 and became the first coach to lead a Zambian club to the group stages of the CAF Champions League after a come-from behind 2\u20131 victory over Malian club Djoliba in Ndola after a goalless draw in the first leg. At the end of the season, he was rewarded with the Coach of the Year award.\n\nHe won the league title the following year and was rewarded with a new three-year contract in February 2011 and another Coach of the Year Award, but when ZESCO suffered some indifferent form, he was fired in July with ZESCO seventh on the Super Division table on 21 points, nine points behind leaders Red Arrows after 13 games played with two games in hand. Chairman Kenneth Muteto stressed that it was not an overnight decision. \"Zesco have set standards in Zambian football which should continue.\" he said, \"From a possible 18 points we picked up six. For a team of Zesco\u2019s stature that is not acceptable.\"\n\nNine days later, he was appointed coach of struggling Nakambala Leopards of Mazabuka but he discovered that the club did not match his ambition and he resigned after a year to join Nchanga Rangers on a three-year deal. Rangers chairman Blackwell Siwale said they were excited to have acquired the services of a top coach like Simukonda. \"Fighton is a renowned coach, one of the top three or four in the country. Therefore when you look at his CV we expect a lot from him.\"\n\nHe led Rangers to a sixth-place finish in 2012 and after a strong start in the 2013 season, Rangers ended up in third place.\nFighton is assistant coach of the Zambia National team headed by George Lwandamina.\n\nHonours\n\nClub honours\nZambian League Title: 1982, 1983, 1985, 1986 and 1988 \nZambian Charity Shield: 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1989\nIndependence Cup: 1981 and 1986 \nHeinrich Cup/Chibuku Cup/Heroes & Unity Cup:  1983\nChampion of Champions: 1986\n\nNational honours\nCECAFA Cup: 1984 in Kenya\nMPLA Trophy: 1986 in Angola\n\nCoaching honours\nZambian Premier League: 2005, 2006 and 2010\nMosi Cup: 1994, 1996\nBP Top 8: 1995, 2008\nCoca-Cola Cup: 2004\nBarclays Cup: 2004, 2010\nCharity Shield: 2006, 2011\nCOSAFA Cup: 1998\n\nPersonal\nThe Nchanga Rangers coach died on 15 February 2016 in Chililabombwe\u2019s Konkola Mine Police after a battle with Diabetes Mellitus.\n\nIndividual honours\nZambian Coach of the Year: 2005, 2009 and 2010\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nTembo, Benedict. \"Stars of yesteryear: Simukonda \u2013 a coaching guru.\" Zambia Daily Mail, 9 October 2010, p.\u00a012\n\n1958 births\n2016 deaths\nZambian footballers\nZambia international footballers\nZambian football managers\nPeople from Chingola\nNkana F.C. players\nJomo Cosmos F.C. players\nDangerous Darkies players\nAssociation footballers not categorized by position", "Rub\u00e9n Alcaraz Jim\u00e9nez (born 1 May 1991) is a Spanish professional footballer who plays as a central midfielder for C\u00e1diz CF.\n\nClub career\nBorn in Barcelona, Catalonia, Alcaraz graduated with CF Damm's youth setup, after a stint at FC Barcelona and RCD Espanyol.

Amiel Weeks Whipple appreciated Cairook's help, and found Cairook to be a willing and fair trader with his party. \n\nOther American explorers and surveyors spoke highly of Cairook, including Charles Ives, who wrote in his journal entry on March 23, 1858 that \"Cairook came to bid us farewell. I was never before so struck with his noble appearance. When he shook hands his head was almost level with mine as he stood beside the mule on which I was riding. He indicated his wishes that we might have a successful trip, and remained watching the train until it was out of sight, waving his hand and smiling his adieus. We all felt regret at parting with him, for he had proved himself a staunch friend.\" According to Fulsom Charles Scrivner, author of Mohave People (1970), Cairook grew to a height of nearly .\n\nIn 1858, an attack on the Rose-Baley Party began the series of events that led to Cairook's death at the hands of American Army officials. The party arrived in late August 1858, arriving along the Colorado River. L.R. Rose, one of the leaders, reported that the Mojaves were very friendly, aiding the tired travelers throughout the evening.  The travelers camped along the Colorado River, and on August 29, Mojave leaders Cairook and Sickahot went to inquire after the travelers, asking if they intended to settle on their Mojave territory or travel onward. On August 30, the traveling party was attacked by Hualapais and seven Mohaves after felling many of the Mojave cottonwood trees along the Colorado River and grazing their cattle on Mojave territory. The remaining Rose-Baley Party members fled.\n\nAfter the attack on the Rose-Baley Party, General N.S. Clarke, the commander of the Military Department of California (headquartered in San Francisco) was convinced that a military post should be constructed at Fort Mojave in order to prevent a general Indian uprising, which he believed was spurred by the encouragement of Mormon emigrants. Clarke sent Lieutenant Colonel William Hoffman and 50 men of the First Mohave Expedition sent to Beale's Crossing to build a post for ensuring military power along the Colorado River.\n\nAlthough initial contact with the Mojaves was friendly, the continued presence of soldiers worried the Mojaves that soldiers were encroaching on their territory in the fertile Mojave Valley over a period of several days in January, 1859. After the initial friendly meetings, Hoffman warned Mojaves to stay away from their camp at night, or risk being shot. He moved his camp to the Colorado River. One night,  Hoffman reported that sentinels shot at several Mojaves and Paiutes (most likely Chemehuevis). He reflected \"The hostile attitude taken by the Indians left little room to doubt that we could not remain another twenty-four hours in the valley without a collision with the Mohave Nation.\"\n\nHoffman decided to attack the Mojaves the following day, killing at least ten Mojaves. Hoffman and his group left for Fort Yuma in order to prepare to bring a show of military force back to Mojave territory. Hoffman demanded that the tribe surrender to US forces, naming the following conditions that he later wrote in a letter to General Clarke on April 24, 1859: \n\"1st. The must offer no opposition to the establishment of posts and roads in and through their country, when and where the government chooses; and the property and lives of whites travelling through their country must be secured.\n2nd. As security for their future good conduct they must place in my hands one hostage for each of the six bands. \n3rd. They must place in my hands the chief who commanded at the threatened attack on my camp in January last. \n4th. They must place in my hands three of those who were engaged in the attack on the emigrant part at this spot last summer\".\n\nCairook was one of the Mojaves who agreed to be taken hostage by the U.S. Government at Fort Yuma. By late June, the imprisoned Mojaves were sick of being held hostage. After Mojave leader Irataba visited to petition for Cairook's release and was refused, Cairook and the other hostages planned their escape. Cairook's role in the escape was to hold the sentry, and he was subsequently bayoneted while the others escaped.  According to Mojave elder Frances Stillman, Cairook had told the other men imprisoned \"You're all young. I'm years ahead of you. I've had a lot of years already that I've spent of my life. When its lunch time, all the guards go to their lunch except that one up there. I'll go up and hold him while you men dive into the water.\"\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n \n\n1859 deaths\nFirst Nations history\nNative American leaders\nMohave people\nArizona Territory\nPeople of the American Old West", "Nadezhda Sergeyevna Glyzina (, n\u00e9e Fedotova; born 20 May 1988) is a Russian female water polo player.

She served in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean and provided destroyer escort protection against submarine and air attack for Navy vessels and convoys.\n\nNamesake\nRaymond Joseph Kretchmer was born on 30 January 1917, in Chicago, Illinois. He enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve on 29 August 1940. He was appointed Midshipman, Naval Reserve, at Northwestern University and commissioned Ensign on 12 September 1941. He was assigned to active duty on 12 September and served on board . He was killed in action 9 August 1942 when Astoria was sunk by Imperial Japanese Navy forces during the Battle of Savo Island.\n\nConstruction and commissioning\nKretchmer was laid down 28 June 1943, by Consolidated Steel Corporation, Orange, Texas; launched 31 August 1943; sponsored by Miss Betty Kretchmer, sister of Ensign Kretchmer; and commissioned 13 December 1943.\n\nWorld War II North Atlantic operations\n\nAfter a Bermuda shakedown Kretchmer departed Charleston, South Carolina, 15 February 1944, for operations in the Caribbean. Based at Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, she escorted convoys to Cuba and Bermuda until sailing for Key West, Florida, 2 May. Assigned to an air wing training detachment, Kretchmer operated with torpedo bombers for 3 weeks, before departing Charleston 8 June escorting a convoy to Europe. Sailing via Cura\u00e7ao, D.W.I., Kretchmer screened shipping bound for Naples, Italy, in preparation for the assaults on southern France. After returning to the United States 16 July, the escort ship made one more cruise to Naples during the summer.\n\nTransfer to the Pacific Fleet \n\nBetween 20 September 1944 and 27 April 1945, Kretchmer sailed as escort to five convoys from New York to United Kingdom ports. After victory in Europe, she prepared for Pacific Fleet duty arriving Pearl Harbor 5 July. Clearing Pearl Harbor 1 August, Kretchmer was en route to the Philippines when hostilities stopped on 14 August.\n \nServing in the Far East until 1 April 1946, the destroyer escort engaged in occupation and repatriation operations, including the evacuation of Allied prisoners of war from Formosa during September 1945. Kretchmer also served on escort duty, mine patrol, and mail runs between Chinese ports. Departing Hong Kong 1 April 1946, she returned home by way of the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean, arriving Charleston, South Carolina, 29 May. Kretchmer decommissioned at Green Cove Springs, Florida, 20 September 1946.\n\nConversion to picket ship \n\nAfter extensive conversion, Kretchmer recommissioned as DER-329 on 22 September 1956. After shakedown in the Caribbean, the radar picket arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, 18 December to commence operations in the Northern Radar Barrier. Based at Newport, Rhode Island, from 1957 to 1962, she remained on picket duty, making regular patrols to provide early warning to the continental air defense systems. Kretchmer also made cruises to northern Europe in 1958, 1961, and 1962, and in August 1961 rescued six men from foundered Icelandic fishing vessel MV Sleipnir.\n\nCuban Missile Crisis activity \n\nIn the aftermath of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Kretchmer departed Newport 23 November 1962 for picket duty off the southern coast of the United States. While operating as plane guard and screen for  in Key West, Florida, waters, Kretchmer rescued two shrimp fishermen from disabled fishing vessel MV Ala, after they had been fired upon by Cuban MiG aircraft. On 21 February 1963, while Kretchmer was guarding Ala, a MiG-17 made four passes at the disabled fishing craft before turning tail ahead of U.S. Marine aircraft.\n \nKretchmer continued picket and training operations in the Atlantic until 21 May 1965, when she entered Boston Naval Shipyard for overhaul prior to deployment in the western Pacific. The ship departed Newport, Rhode Island, for Guam, arriving in Agana, Guam, Mariana Islands on 2 August 1965 after a stopover at Pearl Harbor.\n\nVietnam Operations\n\nOne month later, Kretchmer joined other vessels off the South Vietnam coast in Operation Market Time, keeping coastal traffic under surveillance to prevent the shipment of Communist arms and supply to South Vietnam by sea. Her motor whaleboat came under heavy small arms fire during a roundup operation in November 1965. No American casualties resulted and Kretchmer's search party seized a large number of suspected guerrilla infiltrators.\n \nBy the end of a year of patrol, the ship had investigated some 17,000 contacts, and boarded over 1,000 small craft. On 10 December 1965 Kretchmer steamed into Apra Harbor, Guam, where she remained until her departure 22 February 1966 for a 7-month deployment with the 7th Fleet. She continued \"Market Time\" patrol off the coast and in the harbors of Vietnam working closely with other US Navy and Coast Guard vessels assigned to Task Force 115, searching junks and providing gunfire support for US Marine and US Army operations ashore. She left Subic Bay 29 September 1966 for her homeport, Guam, where she remained in Restricted Availability and leave until 9 January 1967, departing the Guam homeport once again for a nine-month deployment with the 7th Fleet. Kretchmer served Task Force 115 in all nine of South Vietnam's Market Time Zones through 1967, 1968 and briefly in 1969. Notably, on 10 June 1967, Kretchmer and three PCFs rounded up 120 Viet Cong and 60 junks when Republic of Korea Army troops pushed the enemy to shore at Quang Gnai. POWs were held aboard until US Navy small craft transferred the captives. Her continued presence on the South China Sea and Gulf of Siam coasts delineated the commitment of the United States to the preservation of the independence of South Vietnam.\n\nTaiwan Patrol & Hong Kong Station Ship Operations \nWhen Kretchmer was not engaged in Vietnam Market Time Operations or Restricted Availability in homeport Agana, Guam, during her 1965-1969 Western Pacific 7th Fleet deployment, she usually patrolled the Taiwan Straits between Communist China and Taiwan or was assigned to Station Ship Hong Kong, B.C.C. as SOPA (Senior Officer Present Administration). Kretchmer visited Bangkok, Thailand for R&R (rest and recuperation between combat zone patrols), Subic Bay, Philippines for R&R, dry dock and repairs, Yokosuka, Japan for R&R, operational training and certification, Keelung and Kaohsiung, Taiwan for R&R, repairs and resupply between patrols of the Taiwan Straits. Notably, in the latter half of 1969, while on Taiwan Patrol she was caught in winds topping 70 knots and high seas while in the Straits.\n\nKey West \nIn early 1970, after a brief homeport assignment in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Kretchmer transferred to the Atlantic Fleet via the Panama Canal, stopping in San Francisco and Acapulco along the way.  Her new homeport was Key West with DesDiv 601 and was an ASW training ship. During this time, she fired off hedgehogs as a weapons evaluation and later was to drop depth charges between two submarines at periscope depth for the submarine CO/XO school.\n\nFate \nShe was decommissioned in Key West, Florida on 1 October 1973 and stricken 30 September 1973. She was sold for scrapping 14 May 1974.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n NavSource Online: Destroyer Escort Photo Archive \u2013 USS Kretchmer (DE 329)\n\nEdsall-class destroyer escorts\nShips built in Orange, Texas\n1943 ships\nWorld War II frigates and destroyer escorts of the United States", "Patricia Ann Reese (born 1950s) is an American former professional tennis player.\n\nReese grew up in St. Petersburg, Florida, where her father worked as a general surgeon.

Based on the pinch plasma confinement technique, and built at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment in the United Kingdom, ZETA was larger and more powerful than any fusion machine in the world at that time. Its goal was to produce large numbers of fusion reactions, although it was not large enough to produce net energy.\n\nZETA went into operation in August 1957 and by the end of the month it was giving off bursts of about a million neutrons per pulse. Measurements suggested the fuel was reaching between 1 and 5 million kelvins, a temperature that would produce nuclear fusion reactions, explaining the quantities of neutrons being seen. Early results were leaked to the press in September 1957, and the following January an extensive review was released. Front-page articles in newspapers around the world announced it as a breakthrough towards unlimited energy, a scientific advance for Britain greater than the recently launched Sputnik had been for the Soviet Union.\n\nUS and Soviet experiments had also given off similar neutron bursts at temperatures that were not high enough for fusion. This led Lyman Spitzer to express his scepticism of the results, but his comments were dismissed by UK observers as jingoism. Further experiments on ZETA showed that the original temperature measurements were misleading; the bulk temperature was too low for fusion reactions to create the number of neutrons being seen. The claim that ZETA had produced fusion had to be publicly withdrawn, an embarrassing event that cast a chill over the entire fusion establishment. The neutrons were later explained as being the product of instabilities in the fuel. These instabilities appeared inherent to any similar design, and work on the basic pinch concept as a road to fusion power ended by 1961.\n\nIn spite of ZETA's failure to achieve fusion, the device went on to have a long experimental lifetime and produced numerous important advances in the field. In one line of development, the use of lasers to more accurately measure the temperature was tested on ZETA, and was later used to confirm the results of the Soviet tokamak approach. In another, while examining ZETA test runs it was noticed that the plasma self-stabilised after the power was turned off. This has led to the modern reversed field pinch concept. More generally, studies of the instabilities in ZETA have led to several important theoretical advances that form the basis of modern plasma theory.\n\nConceptual development \nThe basic understanding of nuclear fusion was developed during the 1920s as physicists explored the new science of quantum mechanics. George Gamow's 1928 exploration of quantum tunnelling demonstrated that nuclear reactions could take place at lower energies than classical theory predicted. Using this theory, in 1929 Fritz Houtermans and Robert Atkinson demonstrated that expected reaction rates in the core of the Sun supported Arthur Eddington's 1920 suggestion that the Sun is powered by fusion.\n\nIn 1934, Mark Oliphant, Paul Harteck and Ernest Rutherford were the first to achieve fusion on Earth, using a particle accelerator to shoot deuterium nuclei into a metal foil containing deuterium, lithium or other elements. This allowed them to measure the nuclear cross section of various fusion reactions, and determined that the deuterium-deuterium reaction occurred at a lower energy than other reactions, peaking at about 100,000\u00a0electronvolts (100\u00a0keV).\n\nThis energy corresponds to the average energy of particles in a gas heated to thousands of millions of kelvins. Materials heated beyond a few tens of thousands of kelvins dissociate into their electrons and nuclei, producing a gas-like state of matter known as plasma. In any gas the particles have a wide range of energies, normally following the Maxwell\u2013Boltzmann statistics. In such a mixture, a small number of particles will have much higher energy than the bulk.\n\nThis leads to an interesting possibility; even at temperatures well below 100,000 eV, some particles will randomly have enough energy to undergo fusion. Those reactions release huge amounts of energy. If that energy can be captured back into the plasma, it can heat other particles to that energy as well, making the reaction self-sustaining. In 1944, Enrico Fermi calculated this would occur at about 50,000,000 K.\n\nConfinement \n\nTaking advantage of this possibility requires the fuel plasma to be held together long enough that these random reactions have time to occur. Like any hot gas, the plasma has an internal pressure and thus tends to expand according to the ideal gas law. For a fusion reactor, the problem is keeping the plasma contained against this pressure; any known physical container would melt at these temperatures.\n\nA plasma is electrically conductive, and is subject to electric and magnetic fields. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei orbit the magnetic field lines. A simple confinement system is a plasma-filled tube placed inside the open core of a solenoid. The plasma naturally wants to expand outwards to the walls of the tube, as well as move along it, towards the ends. The solenoid creates a magnetic field running down the centre of the tube, which the particles will orbit, preventing their motion towards the sides. Unfortunately, this arrangement does not confine the plasma along the length of the tube, and the plasma is free to flow out the ends.\n\nThe obvious solution to this problem is to bend the tube around into a torus (a ring or doughnut shape). Motion towards the sides remains constrained as before, and while the particles remain free to move along the lines, in this case, they will simply circulate around the long axis of the tube. But, as Fermi pointed out, when the solenoid is bent into a ring, the electrical windings would be closer together on the inside than the outside. This would lead to an uneven field across the tube, and the fuel will slowly drift out of the centre. Some additional force needs to counteract this drift, providing long-term confinement.\n\nPinch concept \n\nA potential solution to the confinement problem had been detailed in 1934 by Willard Harrison Bennett. Any electrical current creates a magnetic field, and due to the Lorentz force, this causes an inward directed force. This was first noticed in lightning rods. Bennett showed that the same effect would cause a current to \"self-focus\" a plasma into a thin column. A second paper by Lewi Tonks in 1937 considered the issue again, introducing the name \"pinch effect\". It was followed by a paper by Tonks and William Allis.\n\nApplying a pinch current in a plasma can be used to counteract expansion and confine the plasma. A simple way to do this is to put the plasma in a linear tube and pass a current through it using electrodes at either end, like a fluorescent lamp. This arrangement still produces no confinement along the length of the tube, so the plasma flows onto the electrodes, rapidly eroding them. This is not a problem for a purely experimental machine, and there are ways to reduce the rate. Another solution is to place a magnet next to the tube; when the magnetic field changes, the fluctuations cause an electric current to be induced in the plasma. The major advantage of this arrangement is that there are no physical objects within the tube, so it can be formed into a torus and allow the plasma to circulate freely.\n\nThe toroidal pinch concept as a route to fusion was explored in the UK during the mid-1940s, especially by George Paget Thomson of Imperial College London. With the formation of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment (AERE) at Harwell, Oxfordshire, in 1945, Thomson repeatedly petitioned the director, John Cockcroft, for funds to develop an experimental machine. These requests were turned down. At the time there was no obvious military use, so the concept was left unclassified. This allowed Thomson and Moses Blackman to file a patent on the idea in 1946, describing a device using just enough pinch current to ionise and briefly confine the plasma while being heated by a microwave source that would also continually drive the current.\n\nAs a practical device there is an additional requirement, that the reaction conditions last long enough to burn a reasonable amount of the fuel. In the original Thomson and Blackman design, it was the job of the microwave injection to drive the electrons to maintain the current and produce pinches that lasted on the order of one minute, allowing the plasma to reach 500 million K. The current in the plasma also heated it; if the current was also used as the heat source, the only limit to the heating was the power of the pulse. This led to a new reactor design where the system operated in brief but very powerful pulses. Such a machine would demand a very large power supply.\n\nFirst machines \nIn 1947, Cockcroft arranged a meeting of several Harwell physicists to study Thomson's latest concepts, including Harwell's director of theoretical physics, Klaus Fuchs. Thomson's concepts were poorly received, especially by Fuchs. When this presentation also failed to gain funding, Thomson passed along his concepts to two graduate students at Imperial, Stanley (Stan) W. Cousins and Alan Alfred Ware (1924-2010). He added a report on a type of toroidal particle accelerator known as the \"Wirbelrohr\" (\"whirl tube\"), designed in Germany by Max Steenbeck. The Wirbelrohr consisted of a transformer with a torus-shaped vacuum tube as its secondary coil, similar in concept to the toroidal pinch devices.\n\nLater that year, Ware built a small machine out of old radar equipment and was able to induce powerful currents. When they did, the plasma gave off flashes of light, but he could not devise a way to measure the temperature of the plasma. Thomson continued to pressure the government to allow him to build a full-scale device, using his considerable political currency to argue for the creation of a dedicated experimental station at the Associated Electrical Industries (AEI) lab that had recently been constructed at Aldermaston.\n\nWare discussed the experiments with anyone who was interested, including Jim Tuck of Clarendon Laboratory at Oxford University. While working at Los Alamos during the war, Tuck and Stanislaw Ulam had built an unsuccessful fusion system using shaped charge explosives, but it did not work. Tuck was joined by Australian Peter Thonemann, who had worked on fusion theory, and the two arranged funding through Clarendon to build a small device like the one at Imperial. But before this work started, Tuck was offered a job in the US, eventually returning to Los Alamos.\n\nThonemann continued working on the idea and began a rigorous programme to explore the basic physics of plasmas in a magnetic field. Starting with linear tubes and mercury gas, he found that the current tended to expand outward through the plasma until it touched the walls of the container (see skin effect). He countered this with the addition of small electromagnets outside the tube, which pushed back against the current and kept it centred. By 1949, he had moved on from the glass tubes to a larger copper torus, in which he was able to demonstrate a stable pinched plasma. Frederick Lindemann and Cockcroft visited and were duly impressed.\n\nCockcroft asked Herbert Skinner to review the concepts, which he did in April 1948. He was sceptical of Thomson's ideas for creating a current in the plasma and thought Thonemann's ideas seemed more likely to work. He also pointed out that the behaviour of plasmas in a magnetic field was not well understood, and that \"it is useless to do much further planning before this doubt is resolved.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at Los Alamos, Tuck acquainted the US researchers with the British efforts. In early 1951, Lyman Spitzer introduced his stellarator concept and was shopping the idea around the nuclear establishment looking for funding. Tuck was sceptical of Spitzer's enthusiasm and felt his development programme was \"incredibly ambitious\". He proposed a much less aggressive programme based on pinch. Both men presented their ideas in Washington in May 1951, which resulted in the Atomic Energy Commission giving Spitzer US$50,000. Tuck convinced Norris Bradbury, the director of Los Alamos, to give him US$50,000 from the discretionary budget, using it to build the Perhapsatron.\n\nEarly results \n\nIn 1950 Fuchs admitted to passing UK and US atomic secrets to the USSR. As fusion devices generated high energy neutrons, which could be used to enrich nuclear fuel for bombs, the UK immediately classified all their fusion research. This meant the teams could no longer work in the open environment of the universities. The Imperial team under Ware moved to the AEI labs at Aldermaston and the Oxford team under Thonemann moved to Harwell.\n\nBy early 1952 there were numerous pinch devices in operation; Cousins and Ware had built several follow-on machines under the name Sceptre, and the Harwell team had built a series of ever-larger machines known as Mark I through Mark IV. In the US, Tuck built his Perhapsatron in January 1952. It was later learned that Fuchs had passed the UK work to the Soviets, and that they had started a fusion programme as well.\n\nIt was clear to all of these groups that something was seriously wrong in the pinch machines. As the current was applied, the plasma column inside the vacuum tube would become unstable and break up, ruining the compression. Further work identified two types of instabilities, nicknamed \"kink\" and \"sausage\". In the kink, the normally toroidal plasma would bend to the sides, eventually touching the edges of the vessel. In the sausage, the plasma would neck down at locations along the plasma column to form a pattern similar to a link of sausages.\n\nInvestigations demonstrated both were caused by the same underlying mechanism. When the pinch current was applied, any area of the gas that had a slightly higher density would create a slightly stronger magnetic field and collapse faster than the surrounding gas. This caused the localised area to have higher density, which created an even stronger pinch, and a runaway reaction would follow. The quick collapse in a single area would cause the whole column to break up.\n\nStabilised pinch \n\nEarly studies of the phenomenon suggested one solution to the problem was to increase the compression rate. In this approach, the compression would be started and stopped so rapidly that the bulk of the plasma would not have time to move; instead, a shock wave created by this rapid compression would be responsible for compressing the majority of the plasma. This approach became known as fast pinch. The Los Alamos team working on the Columbus linear machine designed an updated version to test this theory.\n\nOthers started looking for ways to stabilise the plasma during compression, and by 1953 two concepts had come to the fore. One solution was to wrap the vacuum tube in a sheet of thin but highly conductive metal. If the plasma column began to move, the current in the plasma would induce a magnetic field in the sheet, one that, due to Lenz's law, would push back against the plasma. This was most effective against large, slow movements, like the entire plasma torus drifting within the chamber.\n\nThe second solution used additional electromagnets wrapped around the vacuum tube. The magnetic fields from these magnets mixed with the pinch field created by the current in the plasma. The result was that the paths of the particles within the plasma tube were no longer purely circular around the torus, but twisted like the stripes on a barber's pole. In the US, this concept was known as giving the plasma a \"backbone\", suppressing small-scale, localised instabilities. Calculations showed that this stabilised pinch would dramatically improve confinement times, and the older concepts \"suddenly seemed obsolete\".\n\nMarshall Rosenbluth, recently arrived at Los Alamos, began a detailed theoretical study of the pinch concept. With his wife Arianna W. Rosenbluth and Richard Garwin, he developed \"motor theory\", or \"M-theory\", published in 1954. The theory predicted that the heating effect of the electric current was greatly increased with the power of the electric field. This suggested that the fast pinch concept would be more likely to succeed, as it was easier to produce larger currents in these devices. When he incorporated the idea of stabilising magnets into the theory a second phenomenon appeared; for a particular, and narrow, set of conditions based on the physical size of the reactor, the power of the stabilising magnets and the amount of pinch, toroidal machines appeared to be naturally stable.\n\nZETA begins construction \n\nUS researchers planned to test both fast pinch and stabilised pinch by modifying their existing small-scale machines. In the UK, Thomson once again pressed for funding for a larger machine. This time he was much more warmly received, and initial funding of \u00a3200,000 was provided in late 1954. Design work continued during 1955, and in July the project was named ZETA. The term \"zero energy\" was a phrase used in the nuclear industry to refer to small research reactors, like ZEEP, which had a role similar to ZETA's goal of producing reactions while releasing no net energy.\n\nThe ZETA design was finalised in early 1956. Metropolitan-Vickers was hired to build the machine, which included a 150\u00a0tonne pulse transformer, the largest built in Britain to that point. A serious issue arose when the required high-strength steels needed for the electrical components were in short supply, but a strike in the US electrical industry caused a sudden glut of material, resolving the problem.\n\nZETA was the largest and most powerful fusion device in the world at the time of its construction. Its aluminium torus had an internal bore of  and a major radius of , over three times the size of any machine built to date. It was also the most powerful design, incorporating an induction magnet that was designed to induce currents up to 100,000 amperes (amps) into the plasma. Later amendments to the design increased this to 200,000 amps. It included both types of stabilisation; its aluminium walls acted as the metal shield, and a series of secondary magnets ringed the torus. Windows placed in the gaps between the toroidal magnets allowed direct inspection of the plasma.\n\nIn July 1954, the AERE was reorganised into the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Modifications to Harwell's Hangar 7 in order to house the machine began that year. Despite its advanced design, the price tag was modest: about US$1\u00a0million. By late 1956 it was clear that ZETA was going to come online in mid-1957, beating the Model C stellarator and the newest versions of the Perhapsatron and Columbus. Because these projects were secret, based on the little information available the press concluded they were versions of the same conceptual device, and that the British were far ahead in the race to produce a working machine.\n\nSoviet visit and the push to declassify \n\nFrom 1953 the US had increasingly concentrated on the fast pinch concept. Some of these machines had produced neutrons, and these were initially associated with fusion. There was so much excitement that several other researchers quickly entered the field as well. Among these was Stirling Colgate, but his experiments quickly led him to conclude that fusion was not taking place. According to Spitzer resistivity, the temperature of the plasma could be determined from the current flowing through it. When Colgate performed the calculation, the temperatures in the plasma were far below the requirements for fusion.\n\nThis being the case, some other effect had to be creating the neutrons. Further work demonstrated that these were the result of instabilities in the fuel. The localised areas of high magnetic field acted as tiny particle accelerators, causing reactions that ejected neutrons. Modifications attempting to reduce these instabilities failed to improve the situation and by 1956 the fast pinch concept had largely been abandoned. The US labs began turning their attention to the stabilised pinch concept, but by this time ZETA was almost complete and the US was well behind.\n\nIn 1956, while planning a well publicised state visit by Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin to the UK, the Harwell researchers received an offer from Soviet scientist Igor Kurchatov to give a talk. They were surprised when he began his talk on \"the possibility of producing thermonuclear reactions in a gaseous discharge\". Kurchatov's speech revealed the Soviet efforts to produce fast pinch devices similar to the American designs, and their problems with instabilities in the plasmas. Kurchatov noted that they had also seen neutrons being released, and had initially believed them to be from fusion. But as they examined the numbers, it became clear the plasma was not hot enough and they concluded the neutrons were from other interactions.\n\nKurchatov's speech made it apparent that the three countries were all working on the same basic concepts and had all encountered the same sorts of problems. Cockcroft missed Kurchatov's visit because he had left for the US to press for declassification of the fusion work to avoid this duplication of effort. There was a widespread belief on both sides of the Atlantic that sharing their findings would greatly improve progress. Now that it was known the Soviets were at the same basic development level, and that they were interested in talking about it publicly, the US and UK began considering releasing much of their information as well. This developed into a wider effort to release all fusion research at the second Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in September 1958.\n\nIn June 1957 the UK and US finalised their agreement to release data to each other sometime prior to the conference, which both the UK and the US planned on attending \"in force\". The final terms were reached on 27 November 1957, opening the projects to mutual inspection, and calling for a wide public release of all the data in January 1958.\n\nPromising results \n\nZETA started operation in mid-August 1957, initially with hydrogen. These runs demonstrated that ZETA was not suffering from the same stability problems that earlier pinch machines had seen and their plasmas were lasting for milliseconds, up from microseconds, a full three orders of magnitude improvement. The length of the pulses allowed the plasma temperature to be measured using spectrographic means; although the light emitted was broadband, the Doppler shifting of the spectral lines of slight impurities in the gas (oxygen in particular) led to calculable temperatures.\n\nEven in early experimental runs, the team started introducing deuterium gas into the mix and began increasing the current to 200,000\u00a0amps. On the evening of 30 August the machine produced huge numbers of neutrons, on the order of one million per experimental pulse, or \"shot\". An effort to duplicate the results and eliminate possible measurement failure followed.\n\nMuch depended on the temperature of the plasma; if the temperature was low, the neutrons would not be fusion related. Spectrographic measurements suggested plasma temperatures between 1 and 5 million K; at those temperatures the predicted rate of fusion was within a factor of two of the number of neutrons being seen. It appeared that ZETA had reached the long-sought goal of producing small numbers of fusion reactions, as it was designed to do.\n\nUS efforts had suffered a string of minor technical setbacks that delayed their experiments by about a year; both the new Perhapsatron S-3 and Columbus II did not start operating until around the same time as ZETA in spite of being much smaller experiments. Nevertheless, as these experiments came online in mid-1957, they too began generating neutrons. By September, both these machines and a new design, DCX at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, appeared so promising that Edward Gardner reported that:\n\nPrestige politics \n\nThe news was too good to keep bottled up. Tantalising leaks started appearing in September. In October, Thonemann, Cockcroft and William P. Thompson hinted that interesting results would be following. In November a UKAEA spokesman noted \"The indications are that fusion has been achieved\". Based on these hints, the Financial Times dedicated an entire two-column article to the issue. Between then and early 1958, the British press published an average of two articles a week on ZETA. Even the US papers picked up the story; on 17 November The New York Times reported on the hints of success.\n\nAlthough the British and US had agreed to release their data in full, at this point the overall director of the US program, Lewis Strauss, decided to hold back the release. Tuck argued that the field looked so promising that it would be premature to release any data before the researchers knew that fusion was definitely taking place. Strauss agreed, and announced that they would withhold their data for a period to check their results.\n\nAs the matter became better known in the press, on 26 November the publication issue was raised in House of Commons. Responding to a question by the opposition, the leader of the house announced the results publicly while explaining the delay in publication due to the UK\u2013US agreement. The UK press interpreted this differently, claiming that the US was dragging its feet because it was unable to replicate the British results.\n\nThings came to a head on 12 December when a former member of parliament, Anthony Nutting, wrote a New York Herald Tribune article claiming:\n\nThe article resulted in a flurry of activity in the Macmillan administration. Having originally planned to release their results at a scheduled meeting of the Royal Society, there was great concern over whether to invite the Americans and Soviets, especially as they believed the Americans would be greatly upset if the Soviets arrived, but just as upset if they were not invited and the event was all-British. The affair eventually led to the UKAEA making a public announcement that the US was not holding back the ZETA results, but this infuriated the local press, which continued to claim the US was delaying to allow them to catch up.\n\nEarly concerns \n\nWhen the information-sharing agreement was signed in November a further benefit was realised: teams from the various labs were allowed to visit each other. The US team, including Stirling Colgate, Lyman Spitzer, Jim Tuck and Arthur Edward Ruark, all visited ZETA and concluded there was a \"major probability\" the neutrons were from fusion.\n\nOn his return to the US, Spitzer calculated that something was wrong with the ZETA results. He noticed that the apparent temperature, 5 million K, would not have time to develop during the short firing times. ZETA did not discharge enough energy into the plasma to heat it to those temperatures so quickly. If the temperature was increasing at the relatively slow rate his calculations suggested, fusion would not be taking place early in the reaction, and could not be adding energy that might make up the difference. Spitzer suspected the temperature reading was not accurate. Since it was the temperature reading that suggested the neutrons were from fusion, if the temperature was lower, it implied the neutrons were non-fusion in origin.\n\nColgate had reached similar conclusions. In early 1958, he, Harold Furth and John Ferguson started an extensive study of the results from all known pinch machines. Instead of inferring temperature from neutron energy, they used the conductivity of the plasma itself, based on the well-understood relationships between temperature and conductivity. They concluded that the machines were producing temperatures perhaps  what the neutrons were suggesting, nowhere near hot enough to explain the number of neutrons being produced, regardless of their energy.\n\nBy this time the latest versions of the US pinch devices, Perhapsatron S-3 and Columbus S-4, were producing neutrons of their own. The fusion research world reached a high point. In January, results from pinch experiments in the US and UK both announced that neutrons were being released, and that fusion had apparently been achieved. The misgivings of Spitzer and Colgate were ignored.\n\nPublic release, worldwide interest \n\nThe long-planned release of fusion data was announced to the public in mid-January. Considerable material from the UK's ZETA and Sceptre devices was released in depth in the 25 January 1958 edition of Nature, which also included results from Los Alamos' Perhapsatron S-3, Columbus II and Columbus S-2. The UK press was livid. The Observer wrote that \"Admiral Strauss' tactics have soured what should be an exciting announcement of scientific progress so that it has become a sordid episode of prestige politics.\"\n\nThe results were typical of the normally sober scientific language, and although the neutrons were noted, there were no strong claims as to their source. The day before the release, Cockcroft, the overall director at Harwell, called a press conference to introduce the British press to the results. Some indication of the importance of the event can be seen in the presence of a BBC television field crew, a rare occurrence at that time. He began by introducing the fusion programme and the ZETA machine, and then noted:\n\nThe reporters at the meeting were not satisfied with this assessment and continued to press Cockcroft on the neutron issue. After being asked several times, he eventually stated that in his opinion, he was \"90 percent certain\" they were from fusion. This was unwise; a statement of opinion from a Nobel prize winner was taken as a statement of fact. The next day, the Sunday newspapers were covered with the news that fusion had been achieved in ZETA, often with claims about how the UK was now far in the lead in fusion research. Cockcroft further hyped the results on television following the release, stating: \"To Britain this discovery is greater than the Russian Sputnik.\"\n\nAs planned, the US also released a large batch of results from their smaller pinch machines. Many of them were also giving off neutrons, although ZETA was stabilised for much longer periods and generating more neutrons, by a factor of about 1000. When questioned about the success in the UK, Strauss denied that the US was behind in the fusion race. When reporting on the topic, The New York Times chose to focus on Los Alamos' Columbus II, only mentioning ZETA later in the article, and then concluded the two countries were \"neck and neck.\" Other reports from the US generally gave equal support to both programmes. Newspapers from the rest of the world were more favourable to the UK; Radio Moscow went so far to publicly congratulate the UK while failing to mention the US results at all.\n\nAs ZETA continued to generate positive results, plans were made to build a follow-on machine. The new design was announced in May; ZETA II would be a significantly larger US$14\u00a0million machine whose explicit goal would be to reach 100\u00a0million K, and generate net power. This announcement gathered praise even in the US; The New York Times ran a story about the new version. Machines similar to ZETA were being announced around the world; Osaka University announced their pinch machine was even more successful than ZETA, the Aldermaston team announced positive results from their Sceptre machine costing only US$28,000, and a new reactor was built in Uppsala University that was presented publicly later that year. The Efremov Institute in Leningrad began construction of a smaller version of ZETA, although still larger than most, known as Alpha.\n\nFurther scepticism, retraction of claims \n\nSpitzer had already concluded that known theory suggested that the ZETA was nowhere near the temperatures the team was claiming, and during the publicity surrounding the release of the work, he suggested that \"Some unknown mechanism would appear to be involved\". Other researchers in the US, notably Furth and Colgate, were far more critical, telling anyone who would listen that the results were bunk. In the Soviet Union, Lev Artsimovich rushed to have the Nature article translated, and after reading it, declared \"Chush sobachi!\" (bullshit).\n\nCockcroft had stated that they were receiving too few neutrons from the device to measure their spectrum or their direction. Failing to do so meant they could not eliminate the possibility that the neutrons were being released due to electrical effects in the plasma, the sorts of reactions that Kurchatov had pointed out earlier. Such measurements would have been easy to make.\n\nIn the same converted hangar that housed ZETA was the Harwell Synchrocyclotron effort run by Basil Rose. This project had built a sensitive high-pressure diffusion cloud chamber as the cyclotron's main detector. Rose was convinced it would be able to directly measure the neutron energies and trajectories. In a series of experiments, he showed that the neutrons had a high directionality, at odds with a fusion origin which would be expected to be randomly directed. To further demonstrate this he had the machine run \"backwards\", with the electric current running in the opposite direction. This demonstrated a clear difference in the number of neutrons and their energy, which suggested they were a result of the electrical current itself, not fusion reactions inside the plasma.\n\nThis was followed by similar experiments on Perhapsatron and Columbus, demonstrating the same problems. The issue was a new form of instability, the \"microinstabilities\" or MHD instabilities, that were caused by wave-like signals in the plasma. These had been predicted, but whereas the kink was on the scale of the entire plasma and could be easily seen in photographs, these microinstabilities were too small and rapidly moving to easily detect, and had simply not been noticed before. But like the kink, when these instabilities developed, areas of enormous electrical potential developed, rapidly accelerating protons in the area. These sometimes collided with neutrons in the plasma or the container walls, ejecting them through neutron spallation. This is the same physical process that had been creating neutrons in earlier designs, the problem Cockcroft had mentioned during the press releases, but their underlying cause was more difficult to see and in ZETA they were much more powerful. The promise of stabilised pinch disappeared.\n\nCockcroft was forced to publish a humiliating retraction on 16 May 1958, claiming \"It is doing exactly the job we expected it would do and is functioning exactly the way we hoped it would.\" Le Monde raised the issue to a front-page headline in June, noting \"Contrary to what was announced six months ago at Harwell \u2013 British experts confirm that thermonuclear energy has not been 'domesticated. The event cast a chill over the entire field; it was not only the British who looked foolish, every other country involved in fusion research had been quick to jump on the bandwagon.\n\nHarwell in turmoil, ZETA soldiers on \nBeginning in 1955, Cockcroft had pressed for the establishment of a new site for the construction of multiple prototype power-producing fission reactors. This was strongly opposed by Christopher Hinton, and a furious debate broke out within the UKAEA over the issue. Cockcroft eventually won the debate, and in late 1958 the UKAEA formed AEE Winfrith in Dorset, where they eventually built several experimental reactor designs.\n\nCockcroft had also pressed for the ZETA II reactor to be housed at the new site. He argued that Winfrith would be better suited to build the large reactor, and the unclassified site would better suit the now-unclassified research. This led to what has been described as \"as close to a rebellion that the individualistic scientists at Harwell could possibly mount\". Thonemann made it clear he was not interested in moving to Dorset and suggested that several other high-ranking members would also quit rather than move. He then went on sabbatical to Princeton University for a year. The entire affair was a major strain on Basil Schonland, who took over the Research division when Cockcroft left in October 1959 to become the Master of the newly formed Churchill College, Cambridge.\n\nWhile this was taking place, the original ZETA II proposal had been growing ever-larger, eventually specifying currents as powerful as the Joint European Torus that was built years later. As it seemed this was beyond the state-of-the-art, the project was eventually cancelled in February 1959. A new proposal soon took its place, the Intermediate-Current Stability Experiment (ICSE). ICSE was designed to take advantage of further stabilising effects noticed in M-theory, which suggested that very fast pinches would cause the current to flow only in the outer layer of the plasma, which should be much more stable. Over time, this machine grew to be about the same size as ZETA; ICSE had a 6\u00a0m major diameter and 1\u00a0m minor diameter, powered by a bank of capacitors storing 10\u00a0MJ at 100\u00a0kV.\n\nHarwell was as unsuited to ICSE as it was for ZETA II, so Schonland approached the government with the idea of a new site for fusion research located close to Harwell. He was surprised to find they were happy with the idea, as this would limit employment at Harwell, whose payroll roster was becoming too complex to manage. Further study demonstrated that the cost of building a new site would be offset by the savings in keeping the site near Harwell; if ICSE was built at Winfrith, the travel costs between the sites would be considerable. In May 1959, the UKAEA purchased RNAS Culham, about  from Harwell. ICSE construction began later that year, starting with a one-acre building to house it, known as \"D-1\".\n\nMeanwhile, work continued on ZETA to better understand what was causing the new forms of instabilities. New diagnostic techniques demonstrated that the electron energies were very low, on the order of 10\u00a0eV (approximately 100,000 K) while ion temperatures were somewhat higher at 100\u00a0eV. Both of these pointed to a rapid loss of energy in the plasma, which in turn suggested the fuel was turbulent and escaping confinement to hit the walls of the chamber where it rapidly cooled. A full presentation of the results was made at the Salzburg Conference in 1961, where the Soviet delegation presented very similar results on their ZETA-clone, Alpha.\n\nThe source of this turbulence was not clearly identified at that time, but the team suggested it was due to current-driven resistive modes; if one did not use the simplifying assumption that the plasma had no macroscopic resistance, new instabilities would naturally appear. When the new head of the UKAEA, William Penney, heard that the ICSE design was also based on the resistance-free assumption, he cancelled the project in August 1960. Parts for the partially-assembled reactor were scavenged by other teams.\n\nThonemann had returned by this point and found much to disagree with on ICSE. He demanded to be allowed to set up a new fusion group to remain at Harwell on ZETA. ZETA remained the largest toroidal machine in the world for some time, and went on to have a productive career for just over a decade, but in spite of its later successes ZETA was always known as an example of British folly.\n\nThomson scattering and tokamaks \n\nZETA's failure was due to limited information; using the best available measurements, ZETA was returning several signals that suggested the neutrons were due to fusion. The original temperature measures were made by examining the Doppler shifting of the spectral lines of the atoms in the plasma. The inaccuracy of the measurement and spurious results caused by electron impacts with the container led to misleading measurements based on the impurities, not the plasma itself. Over the next decade, ZETA was used continuously in an effort to develop better diagnostic tools to resolve these problems.\n\nThis work eventually developed a method that is used to this day. The introduction of lasers provided a new solution through a British discovery known as Thomson scattering. Lasers have extremely accurate and stable frequency control, and the light they emit interacts strongly with free electrons. A laser shone into the plasma will be reflected off the electrons, and during this process will be Doppler shifted by the electrons' movement. The speed of the electrons is a function of their temperature, so by comparing the frequency before and after collisions, the temperature of the electrons could be measured with an extremely high degree of accuracy. By \"reversing\" the system, the temperature of the ions could also be directly measured.\n\nThrough the 1960s ZETA was not the only experiment to suffer from unexpected performance problems. Problems with plasma diffusion across the magnetic fields plagued both the magnetic mirror and stellarator programs, at rates that classical theory could not explain. Adding more fields did not appear to correct the problems in any of the existing designs. Work slowed dramatically as teams around the world tried to better understand the physics of the plasmas in their devices. Pfirsch and Schluter were the first to make a significant advance, suggesting that much larger and more powerful machines would be needed to correct these problems. An attitude of pessimism took root across the entire field.\n\nIn 1968 a meeting of fusion researchers took place in Novosibirsk, where, to everyone's astonishment, the Soviet hosts introduced their work on their tokamak designs which had performance numbers that no other experiment was even close to matching. The latest of their designs, the T-3, was producing electron energies of 1000\u00a0eV, compared to about 10\u00a0eV in ZETA. This corresponded to a plasma temperature of about 10 million K. Although the Soviet team was highly respected, the results were so good that there was serious concern their indirect temperature measurements might be unreliable and they had fallen prey to a measurement problem like the one that had occurred with ZETA. Spitzer, once again, expressed his scepticism rather strongly, sparking off an acrimonious debate with Artsimovich.\n\nThe Soviets were equally concerned about this, and even though it was the height of the Cold War, Artsimovich invited UKAEA to bring their laser system to the Kurchatov Institute and independently measure the performance. Artsimovich had previously called their system \"brilliant.\" The team became known as \"the Culham five\", performing a series of measurements in late 1968 and early 1969. The resulting paper was published in November 1969 and convinced the fusion research field that the tokamak was indeed reaching the levels of performance the Soviets claimed. The result was a \"veritable stampede\" of tokamak construction around the world, and it remains the most studied device in the fusion field.\n\nTokamaks are toroidal pinch machines. The key difference is the relative strengths of the fields. In the stabilised pinch machines, most of the magnetic field in the plasma was generated by the current induced in it. The strength of the external stabilisation fields was much lower and only penetrated into the outer layers of the plasma mass. The tokamak reversed this; the external magnets were much more powerful and the plasma current greatly reduced in comparison. Artsimovich put it this way:\n\nThis difference is today part of a general concept known as the safety factor, denoted q. It has to be greater than one to maintain stability during a discharge; in ZETA it was about . A ZETA-type machine could reach this q, but would require enormously powerful external magnets to match the equally large fields being generated by the current. The tokamak approach resolved this by using less pinch current; this made the system stable but meant the current could no longer be used to heat the plasma. Tokamak designs require some form of external heating.\n\nReversed field pinch \n\nIn 1965, the newly opened Culham laboratory hosted what had become a periodic meeting of international fusion researchers. Of all the work presented, only two papers on stabilised pinch were present, both on ZETA. Spitzer did not mention them during the opening comments.\n\nNormally, the pulse of electricity sent into ZETA formed a current pulse with a shape similar to a Poisson distribution, ramping up quickly then trailing off. One of the papers noted that the plasma stability reached a maximum just after the current began to taper off, and then lasted longer than the current pulse itself. This phenomenon was dubbed \"quiescence\".\n\nThree years later, at the same meeting where Soviet results with the T-3 tokamak were first released, a paper by Robinson and King examined the quiescence period. They determined it was due to the original toroidal magnetic field reversing itself, creating a more stable configuration. At the time, the enormity of the T-3 results overshadowed this result.\n\nJohn Bryan Taylor took up the issue and began a detailed theoretical study of the concept, publishing a groundbreaking 1974 article on the topic. He demonstrated that as the magnetic field that generated the pinch was relaxing, it interacted with the pre-existing stabilising fields, creating a self-stable magnetic field. The phenomenon was driven by the system's desire to preserve magnetic helicity, which suggested a number of ways to improve the confinement time.\n\nAlthough the stabilising force was lower than the force available in the pinch, it lasted considerably longer. It appeared that a reactor could be built that would approach the Lawson criterion from a different direction, using extended confinement times rather than increased density. This was similar to the stellarator approach in concept, and although it would have lower field strength than those machines, the energy needed to maintain the confinement was much lower. Today this approach is known as the reversed field pinch (RFP) and has been a field of continued study.\n\nTaylor's study of the relaxation into the reversed state led to his development of a broader theoretical understanding of the role of magnetic helicity and minimum energy states, greatly advancing the understanding of plasma dynamics. The minimum-energy state, known as the \"Taylor state\", is particularly important in the understanding of new fusion approaches in the compact toroid class. Taylor went on to study the ballooning transformation, a problem that was occurring in the latest high-performance toroidal machines as large-scale waveforms formed in the plasma. His work in fusion research won him the 1999 James Clerk Maxwell Prize for Plasma Physics.\n\nDemolition \nCulham officially opened in 1965, and various teams began leaving the former sites through this period. A team kept ZETA operational until September 1968. Hangar 7, which housed ZETA and other machines, was demolished during financial year 2005/2006.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links \n Britain's Sputnik \u2013 BBC Radio 4 programme on ZETA first broadcast on 16 January 2008\n ZETA \u2013 Peace Atoms, contemporary newsreel story on the reactor.\n \n\nMagnetic confinement fusion devices\nNuclear power in the United Kingdom\nNuclear research institutes in the United Kingdom\nNuclear research reactors\nNuclear technology in the United Kingdom\nResearch institutes in Oxfordshire\nVale of White Horse", "Dps is a Japanese rock band under the Giza Studio label.\n\nHistory\nIn May 2016, Naoki participated in Zard's live tour session \"25th Anniversary Live\" as a guitarist.

Its name is derived from the Ancient Greek \u00f3nkos (\u1f44\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, 'barb') and pr\u00edstis (\u03c0\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2, 'saw' or 'sawfish'). It contains two valid species, O. numida and O. dunklei. Onchopristis first appeared in the Barremian and its latest occurrence dates to the Campanian, making it one of the oldest and longest-lived sclerorhynchoid genera.\n\nDescription\nSpecimens of O. numida, IPUW 353500 and IGR 2818, suggest a length estimate of  and , respectively; such individuals would have weighed . Like other sclerorhynchoids, it had a long rostrum with large denticles similar to sawfishes and sawsharks. This feature was convergently evolved and its closest living relatives are actually skates. Isolated rostral denticles are the most common fossils of Onchopristis, but rostra, chondrocrania, jaws, oral teeth, vertebrae, and dermal denticles have also been found.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nGigantichthys numidus was named by \u00c9mile Haug in 1905 for fragmentary rostral denticles from the Continental intercalaire of Algeria. Haug also named Platyspondylus foureaui for vertebrae from the same formation. Articulated specimens have confirmed that the rostral denticles and vertebrae belong to the same species. In 1917, Ernst Stromer named the new genus Onchopristis with \"G\". numidus as the type species. Although the spelling \"Onchopristis numidus\" is commonly used, it is grammatically incorrect and has been emended to O. numida. \n\nOral teeth from the Bahariya Formation of Egypt were named Squatina aegyptiaca by Stromer in 1927, and were later renamed as the separate genus Sechmetia by Christa Werner in 1989. Again, articulated specimens confirmed that these teeth belong to O. numida. In 1935, Wilhelm Weiler named Peyeria libyca for what he thought were sawfish rostral denticles from the Bahariya Formation. An associated specimen of Ischyrhiza mira, a close relative of Onchopristis, indicates that \"Peyeria\" are actually dermal denticles from O. numida. \n\nA second valid species from the Woodbine Formation of Texas, Onchopristis dunklei, was named by Charles McNulty, Jr. and Bob Slaughter in 1962. In 1971, John Thurmond named the subspecies O. dunklei praecursor, but it is probably not distinct from O. dunklei. Rostral denticles from New Zealand formerly referred to \"O. d. praecursor\" have been reassigned to their own genus and species, Australopristis wiffeni.\n\nReferences\n\nPrehistoric cartilaginous fish genera\nCretaceous cartilaginous fish\nPrehistoric fish of Africa\nSclerorhynchoidei", "The German Social Union (, DSU) is a small conservative political party mainly active in the new states of Germany. It was founded in 1990 as a right-wing opposition group during the Wende transition to democracy in East Germany, when it was part of the Alliance for Germany electoral coalition. After 1990, it fell into insignificance, only holding a few seats on the local level.\n\nIdeology\nAccording to its 2006 basic programme, the DSU refers to itself as a conservative, democratic and social party. Ideologically, the party's goals are to preserve and uphold Western-Christian civilization, and to dismantle the welfare state..\n\nThe party can thus be seen as right-wing (anti-socialistic) national-conservative. It strongly differentiates itself from the National Democratic Party (NPD) and German People's Union (DVU), who tend more towards national socialism. Its closest ideological ally among the right-wing parties is The Republicans. Historically, and as its name implies, it is modelled after the CSU in Bavaria, the more rightist of the two Union \"sister parties\". However it was not possible for the DSU to join the CSU, as the CDU and CSU do not compete in the same states.\n\nHistory\n\nEstablishment\n\nIn the chaotic world of 1989\u20131990 East German politics, several long-suppressed cultural and political movements (re)emerged, and numerous small parties sprang up. The German Social Union was one of these, then several comprising conservative, Christian-democratic and liberal opposition groups.\n\nThe party was founded in Leipzig on 20 January 1990 by the St. Thomas Church pastor Hans-Wilhelm Ebeling, modeled loosely on the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (Christlich-Soziale Union, CSU). Initially, the Bavarian CSU supported the DSU to the tune of millions, wishing to make it its East German branch, and thus revisiting Franz Josef Strau\u00df' mid-1970s plan to make the CSU a nationwide \"fourth party\".\n\nReunification period\n\nOn 5 February 1990, DSU joined the Alliance for Germany together with the centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the now-defunct Democratic Awakening (DA) to form the Alliance for Germany, a centre-right coalition which ran in the first (and only) free East German general election of 18 March 1990. The DSU polled 6.3% of the votes cast and 25 seats in the People's Chamber parliament. It achieved its strongest results in the southern districts of Karl-Marx-Stadt, Dresden and Leipzig (that later formed the state of Saxony), where the DSU polled two-digit percentages.\n\nIts most prominent politician was the lawyer Peter-Michael Diestel, who joined the last East German cabinet (Council of Ministers) under Lothar de Maizi\u00e8re as minister of the interior and deputy prime minister. The DSU also held the ministry of economic cooperation, led by Hans-Wilhelm Ebeling. However, both Diestel and Ebeling left the party in June and July 1990, respectively, Diestel joined the CDU a month later. Of all parties in the People's Chamber, the DSU was the keenest on a swift reunification of East and West Germany. Its delegates repeatedly proposed a motion for East Germany's \"immediate accession\" to the Federal Republic of Germany.\n\nHansjoachim Walther, a mathematics professor, was elected chairman of the DSU on the first regular party congress in May 1990. Under his leadership, the party took a turn to the right, hosting national-conservative and in some cases even far-right voices. Unlike the other parliamentary parties and a vast majority of the population, numerous DSU members did not accept the Oder\u2013Neisse line as Germany's eastern border (which was finally laid down in the reunification treaty and the Two Plus Four Agreement).\n\nAfter German reunification was accomplished on 3 October 1990, eight DSU People's Chamber deputies entered into the Bundestag (federal parliament), where they joined the CDU/CSU parliamentary group. The Alliance for Germany coalition dissolved after that. In Chancellor Helmut Kohl's third cabinet, the DSU was represented by Hansjoachim Walther as federal minister without portfolio from October 1990 to January 1991. In the October 1990 legislative elections in the new German states, the DSU did not pass the five-percent threshold, winning 3.6% in its former stronghold of Saxony and even less in the other states, and thus failed to enter into any Landtag (state legislature).\n\nAhead of the first post-reunification German federal election on 2 December 1990, the Bavarian CSU aimed for a deal with the CDU to save its East German offshoot from irrelevance: If the CDU had abstained from competing in a few constituencies in Saxony and Thuringia, thus winning the DSU at least three \"direct mandates\", the small party could have been spared from the five-percent threshold and might have survived as a regional party. However, the CDU under Helmut Kohl insisted on the unwritten CDU/CSU agreement that the CSU may only run in Bavaria, while all other states are CDU's territory. Many DSU members realised that the party had no future and switched to the CDU. Eventually, DSU achieved 0.2% of nationwide votes, 1.0% in the new states. After this disappointment, the Bavarian CSU reduced its benefits to the DSU, but continued to transfer six-figure sums annually until 1993.\n\nAfter 1990 \nThe DSU drifted further towards a nationalistic course, aiming for a position inbetween the centre-right CDU and the far-right Republicans. During the early-1990s, the party received support by the (West German) Neue Rechte (\"New Right\") movement, in particular by the Critic\u00f3n magazine of Caspar von Schrenck-Notzing, who also attended DSU meetings. The DSU's image was then characterised by financial misconduct, internal squabbles, resignations, and contacts with far-right groups. The cooperation of DSU and CSU was definitely ended after the Spring 1993 party conference, when Roberto Rink was elected chairman of the DSU.\n\nIn subsequent elections its share of the vote has remained under 1% of the vote in all Landtag elections held in the new states. Electoral coalitions with right-wing parties like the German Party, the Party for a Rule of Law Offensive or the Statt Party led to no avail. Nevertheless, the DSU has a loyal following of voters on the local level, especially in some districts of Saxony. In the western states, the party is virtually nonexistent.\n\nThe DSU had one member in the Landtag of Saxony from 2006 to 2009, after the NPD parliamentarian Klaus Baier had defected from his party after a series of disputes and joined the DSU.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nThe DSU from Chronik der Wende \n\n1990 establishments in East Germany\nConservative parties in Germany\nNational conservative parties\nPolitical parties established in 1990\nPolitical parties in East Germany\nRight-wing populism in Germany", "Meave G.

She named the find Kenyanthropus platyops (\"flat-faced man of Kenya\").\n\nPersonal life \nLeakey was married to Richard Leakey, a palaeontologist. They have two children, Louise (born 1972) and Samira (born 1974). Louise Leakey continues family traditions by conducting palaeontological research.\n\nLeakey initially studied zoology and marine zoology at the University of North Wales. Her first contact with the Leakey family was working for the Tigoni Primate Research Centre while taking her PhD at this time, the centre was being administered by Louis Leakey.\n\nShe received her PhD in zoology in 1968. In 2004, she was awarded an honorary D.Sc. from University College, London, for palaeontology. That same year, she received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. Leakey is currently a Research Professor for the Turkana Basin Institute (affiliated with Stony Brook University). On 30 April 2013, Leakey was elected as a Foreign Associate of the US National Academy of Sciences, with specialities of geology and anthropology. This made Leakey the first Kenyan citizen and also the first woman citizen of an African country to be elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences. She was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2017.\n\nPosition in the Leakey family\n\nSelected publications\n\nLothagam: The Dawn of Humanity in Eastern Africa by John Harris and Meave Leakey, Eds.

The division originally consisted of the 47th, 48th and 49th Indian Infantry Brigades. The divisions' first General Officer Commanding (GOC) was Major General Sir Jackie Smyth VC, who left in December to take command of the 17th Indian Infantry Division, then fighting in Burma. Between January and April 1942 all three brigades were reassigned and replaced by the 62nd, 64th and 98th Indian Infantry Brigades.\n\nAfter short periods under the command of Major General Geoffry Scoones and Douglas Stuart the division in October 1942 came under the command Major General Thomas Wynford Rees, who was to become GOC until December 1945. The division spent an extended period on internal security duties and in training before being committed to the Fourteenth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Sir William J. \"Bill\" Slim, on the Burma front in July 1944. From October the division concentrated on the Imphal plain under IV Corps and from November its brigades were involved in operations on the Chindwin River advancing to establish contact with the British 36th Infantry Division advancing from the north on their left. Concentrating once more at Sinlamaung the division came under Indian XXXIII Corps, and played the major role in the capture of Mandalay which was completed on 20 March. Transferred to IV Corps, it guarded the Fourteenth Army's lines of communication and mounted an offensive towards Mawchi, in the Kayah State.\n\nThe division's successes were due to its fitness and high morale. It had a high proportion of pre-war regular soldiers among its officers and senior Non-Commissioned Officers. The 19th Indian Division was occasionally referred to as the \"Dagger Division\", from its divisional sign, which was a hand thrusting a dagger overhand, in yellow on a red background.\n\nDuring the Second World War, a large number of brigades were assigned or attached to the division. The included at various points the 9th, 47th, 48th, 49th, 62nd, 64th, 98th and 99th Indian Infantry Brigades as well as the 22nd (East Africa) Infantry Brigade.\n\nOrder of Battle 1 March 1945\nGeneral Officer Commanding: Major General Thomas Wynford Rees\nCommander, Royal Artillery: Brigadier John Alexander MacDonald\nChief of Staff (GSO1): Lieutenant Colonel John Masters\n\n62nd Indian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier James Ronald Morris)\n 2nd Battalion, Welch Regiment\n 3rd Battalion, 6th Rajputana Rifles\n 4th Battalion, 6th Gurkha Rifles\n64th Indian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier John Godfrey Flewett)\n 2nd Battalion, Worcestershire Regiment\n 5th Battalion, 10th Baluch Regiment\n 1st Battalion, 6th Gurkha Rifles\n98th Indian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Charles Ian Jerrard)\n 2nd Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment\n 8th Battalion, 12th Frontier Force Regiment\n 4th Battalion, 4th Gurkha Rifles\nDivisional Troops\n 7th Light Cavalry (attached) Stuart Tanks\n 1st Battalion, Assam Regiment (attached)\n 1st Battalion, 15th Punjab Regiment (Divisional reconnaissance regiment)\n MG Battalion, 11th Sikh Regiment (Divisional Machine Gun Battalion)\n 134th Medium Regiment, Royal Artillery\n 4th Field Regiment, Royal Indian Artillery\n 5th Field Regiment, Indian Artillery\n 115th (North Midland) Field Regiment, Royal Artillery\n 20th Mountain Regiment, Indian Artillery\n 33rd Anti-tank Regiment, Royal Artillery (mixed anti-tank and light anti-aircraft batteries)\n Queen Victoria's Own Madras Sappers & Miners, Indian Engineers\n 64th Field Company, Indian Engineers\n 65th Field Company, Indian Engineers\n 327th Field Park Company, Indian Engineers\n Royal Bombay Sappers and Miners, Indian Engineers\n 29th Field Company, Indian Engineers\n 9th Bridging Platoon, Indian Engineers\n\nPostwar\n\nJust before the Indian/Pakistani war of 1965 began, 19th Infantry Division was at Baramula under XV Corps (India).

The Royal Marines are the only part of the British Armed Forces where officers and other ranks are trained at the same location, the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines (CTCRM) at Lympstone, Devon.  Much of the basic training is carried out on the rugged terrain of Dartmoor and Woodbury Common with a significant proportion taking place at night.\n\nSelection\n\nAll potential recruits take a psychometric test and are interviewed at the Armed Forces Careers Office (AFCO) to assess their suitability. A series of physical assessments are conducted including a sight test and medical examination. Then the Pre Joining Fitness Test: two 1.5-mile runs (2.4\u00a0km) on a treadmill, the first to be completed within 12 minutes 30 seconds, the second within 10 minutes and 30 seconds, with 1 minute of rest in between.\n\nRoyal Marines recruits must be aged 16 to 32 (they must be in Recruit Training before their 33rd birthday). Due to the July 2016 lifting on the ban on women in Ground Close Combat roles, females are now permitted to join all British military infantry units, including the Royal Marines Commandos.\n\nThe final selection assessment for potential recruits is either the Potential Royal Marine Course (PRMC) for ratings candidates, or the Potential Officer Course (POC) and Admiralty Interview Board for officer candidates. PRMC and POC last three days and assess physical ability and intellectual capacity to undertake the recruit training. Potential Officers must be aged 18 to 25.\n\nTraining\n\nBasic training\nThe first weeks of training are spent learning basic skills that will be used later. This includes much time spent on the parade ground and on the rifle ranges. The long history of the Royal Marines is also highlighted through a visit to the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea, Hampshire.\n\nPhysical training at this stage emphasizes all-round physical strength, endurance and flexibility in order to develop the muscles necessary to carry the heavy equipment a marine will use in an operational unit.  Key milestones include a gym passout at week 9 (not carried out with fighting order), a battle swimming test, and learning to do a \"regain\" (i.e. climb back onto a rope suspended over a water tank). Most of these tests are completed wearing fighting order of 31\u00a0lb (14\u00a0kg) of Personal Load Carrying Equipment. Individual fieldcraft skills are also taught at this basic stage.\n\nYoung officer (YO) training begins with Phase 1 which teaches the officers how to be Royal Marines.\n\nTraining modules\n\nFoundation \u2013 3 weeks\n\nIndividual Skills \u2013 7 weeks\n\nAdvanced Skills \u2013 5 weeks\n\nOperations Of War \u2013 10 weeks\n\nCommando Phase \u2013 6 weeks\n\nKings Squad \u2013 1 week\n\nYO Training Modules\n\nPhase 1: Initial Training\n\nThis 16-week training course will introduce the YO's to the core skills they need to be a Royal Marine, and assess their abilities in an intensive and progressive environment.\n\nPhase 2: Tactics and Doctrine Training\n\nFor the next 12 weeks the training will switch focus to Section and Troop level tactical development. Using what the YO's have already learnt, they will spend time preparing, delivering and receiving orders. This phase will incorporate a mixture of academic study and advanced physical training.\n\nPhase 3 \u2013 Defensive, Fibua, Special to Arms, and Commando Course Phase\n\nThis six-week phase will hone the YO's defensive skills, teaching  the principles of transitional operations, and introduce the YO's to the tactics of Fighting In Built Up Areas (FIBUA).\n\nPhase 4 \u2013 Advanced Military Management Training\n\nThis phase is designed to broaden the YO's experience and military knowledge. They will complete a two-week range qualification course, before further academic study at BRNC Dartmouth. Additional exercises will take place during a deployment to the United States.\n\nPhase 5 \u2013 Unit Management, Exercise Planning and Final Exercise.\n\nThis phase will provide the YO's with the essential ability to administrate and manage their men. Topics that they will cover, include:\n\nMilitary law\n\nReport writing\n\nUnit documentation\n\nStrategic studies\n\nA planning exercise in Normandy\n\nTraining exercises\n\nThroughout basic training, recruits must undergo many exercises testing what they have learnt up to that point.\n\n Early Knight \u2013 week 2\n First Step \u2013 week 4\n Quick Cover \u2013 week 5\n Marshal Star \u2013 week 7\n Hunters Moon \u2013 week 10\n Baptist Walk \u2013 week 13\n Baptist Run \u2013 week 14\n First Base \u2013 week 16\n Second Empire \u2013 week 18\n Holdfast \u2013 week 20\n Urban Warrior \u2013 week 21\n Violent Entry \u2013 week 22\n Field Firing exercise \u2013 weeks 26 & 27\n Final exercise \u2013 weeks 29 & 30\n Commando tests \u2013 week 31\n\nYO Training exercises\n\nThroughout YO training, Young Officers must undergo many exercises testing what they have learnt up to that point.\n\nPhase 1\n First Stop \u2013 This is designed to introduce them to life in the field, teaching them how to look after themselves and navigate by day and night\n Tenderfoot \u2013 Here they will put the skills they have developed into practice, progressing to basic fieldcraft\n Lost Tribe \u2013 This is a day and night navigation exercise on Dartmoor. They'll need to be able to cope with unfamiliar terrain and remain calm under pressure\n Eye Opener \u2013 Another navigation exercise, this will also test their day and night navigation skills. It takes place over a longer period of time, so they will need stamina to be successful\n Quickdraw I \u2013 This is a firing range exercise, which is designed to bring their marksmanship skills up to standard. At the end of the exercise, they will take the Annual Combat Marksmanship Test (ACMT)\n Softly Softly \u2013 Here they will be introduced to low-level soldiering skills and basic operating procedures, at the same time as developing an understanding of the Estimate and Orders process\n\nPhase 2\n Quickdraw II \u2013 They will make the transition from the firing range to live field firing, starting with Close Quarter Battle (CQB), before progressing to team firing and manoeuvres\n Long Night \u2013 Over the course of a week they will develop your tactical knowledge, and the ability to take the lead in different scenarios\n Eagle Eye \u2013 they will be taught to establish and run surface and sub-surface observation points\n Jagged Edge \u2013 This will teach them all about Troop level battle procedures and offensive operations\n Dragon Storm \u2013 Drawing on everything they've learned about offensive operations, they will complete a test exercise\n Quickdraw III \u2013 Tactical live firing training\n\nPhase 3\n Open Door \u2013 This exercise will focus on conducting FIBUA operations up to Troop level\n Special To Arms Week \u2013 Here they will have an introduction to the specialist weapons and equipment that they'll use throughout their career\n Endurance Course \u2013 they will need to complete this in less than 71 minutes\n A 9-mile Speed March \u2013 they will need to complete this uphill route in less than 90 minutes\n Tarzan Assault Course \u2013 This ropes and ladders course will need to be completed in less than 12 minutes\n The 30 Miler \u2013 they will have 7 hours to complete this cross-terrain challenge, unlike recruits they must navigate it themselves\n\nPhase 4\n Stone Post \u2013 they will conduct a number of visits that focus on the Army's land capabilities. This will broaden their Service knowledge\n Special To Arms Week \u2013 Here they will have an introduction to the specialist weapons and equipment that they'll use throughout their career\n Deep Blue \u2013 Similar to Stone Post, this exercise will provide them with an insight into the capabilities of the Royal Navy\n Virginia Tempest \u2013 This is a three-week deployment to the US, where they will forge closer links with the United States Marine Corps, and complete a number field exercises\n\nPhase 5\nFinal Exercise consists of:\n Wet Raider \u2013 Taking place on the West Coast of Scotland, this is where their amphibious training will conclude\n Counter Insurgency \u2013 This is one of the most realistic experiences in training, replicating a full-scale riot\n Final Nail \u2013 they will be integrated with trained marines and use VIKING vehicles\n Otter's Run \u2013 Use of a series of hypothetical scenarios to hone their decision-making skills\n\nThe Commando course\nThe culmination of training is the Commando course. Following the Royal Marines taking on responsibility for the Commando role with the disbandment of the Army Commandos at the end of World War II, all Royal Marines, except those in the Royal Marines Band Service, complete the Commando course as part of their training (see below). Key aspects of the course include climbing and ropework techniques, patrolling and amphibious warfare operations.\n\nThis intense phase ends with a series of tests which have remained virtually unchanged since World War II. Again, these tests are done in full fighting order of 32\u00a0lb (14.5\u00a0kg) of equipment.\n\nThe Commando tests are taken on consecutive days and all four tests must be successfully completed within a seven-day period; they include;\n\nA nine mile (14.5\u00a0km) speed march, carrying full fighting order, to be completed in 90 minutes; the pace is thus 10 minutes per mile (9.6\u00a0km/h or 6\u00a0mph).\nThe Endurance course is a six-mile (9.65\u00a0km) course which begins with a two-mile (3.22\u00a0km) run across rough moorland and woodland terrain at Woodbury Common near Lympstone, which includes tunnels, pipes, wading pools, and an underwater culvert. The course ends with a four-mile (6\u00a0km) run back to CTCRM. Followed by a marksmanship test, where the recruit must hit 6 out of 10 shots at a 25m target simulating 200 m. To be completed in 73 minutes (71 minutes for Royal Marine officers). Originally 72 minutes, these times were recently increased by one minute as the route of the course was altered.\nThe Tarzan Assault Course. This is an assault course combined with an aerial confidence test. It starts with a death slide (now known as the Commando Slide) and ends with a rope climb up a thirty-foot near-vertical wall. It must be completed with full fighting order in 13 minutes, 12 minutes for officers. The Potential Officers Course also includes confidence tests from the Tarzan Assault Course, although not with equipment.\nThe 30 miler. This is a 30-mile (48-km) march across upland Dartmoor, wearing full fighting order, and additional safety equipment carried by the recruit in a daysack. It must be completed in eight hours for recruits and seven hours for Royal Marine officers, who must also navigate the route themselves, rather than following a DS (a trained Royal Marine) with the rest of a syndicate and carry their own equipment.\n\nAfter the  march, any who failed any of the tests may attempt to retake them up until the seven-day window expires. If a recruit fails two or more of the tests, however, it is unlikely that a chance to re-attempt them will be offered.\n\nNormally the seven- to eight-day schedule for the Commando Tests is as follows:\nSaturday \u2013 Endurance Course\nSunday \u2013 Rest\nMonday \u2013 Nine Mile Speed March\nTuesday \u2013 Tarzan Assault Course\nWednesday \u2013 30 Miler\nThursday \u2013 Failed test re-runs\nFriday \u2013 Failed test re-runs\nSaturday \u2013 30 Miler re-run if required\n\nCompleting the Commando course successfully entitles the recruit or officer to wear the green beret but does not mean that the Royal Marine has finished his training. That decision will be made by the troop or batch training team and will depend on the recruit's or young officer's overall performance. Furthermore, officer training consists of many more months.  Training to be a Royal Marine takes 32 weeks. The last week is spent mainly on administration and preparing for the pass out parade. Recruits in their final week of training are known as the King's Squad and have their own section of the recruits' galley at Lympstone.  After basic and commando training, a Royal Marine Commando will normally join a unit of 3 Commando Brigade. There are four Royal Marines Commando infantry units in the Brigade: 40 Commando located at Norton Manor Camp near Taunton in Somerset; 42 Commando at Bickleigh Barracks, near Plymouth, Devon; 43 Commando FPGRM at HMNB Clyde near Glasgow; and 45 Commando at RM Condor, Arbroath on the coast of Angus.\n\nNon-Royal Marine volunteers for Commando training undertake the All Arms Commando Course.  There is also a Reserve Commando Course run for members of the Royal Marines Reserve and Commando units of the Army Reserve.\n\nYO Exams/Qualifications\n Map reading exam\n Signals exam\n Military Law exam\n Operations other than war exam\n Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Defence exam\n Strategic studies exam\n Part 1, Part 2 and end of course final exams\n The Commando tests\n Infantry range supervisor's qualification\n Helicopter Underwater Escape Training\n One-day Sea Survival Course\n Information Technology Level 2\n Defence Instructional Technique\n\nSpecialist training\n\nUpon completion of training, Royal Marine recruits spend a period of time as a General Duties Rifleman. They are assigned to one of the three Commando battalions or a Fleet Standby Rifle Troop on board a Royal Navy ship for up to two years before being sent for specialist training.\n\nCommandos may then go on to undertake specialist training in a variety of skills:\n\nRecruit Specialisations\nAircrewman\nAssault Engineer\nArmoured Support Group (Viking)\nArmourer\nClerk\nCombat Intelligence\nCommunications Technician\nDrill Instructor\nDriver\nHeavy Weapons \u2013 Air Defence\nHeavy Weapons \u2013 Anti-Tank\nHeavy Weapons \u2013 Mortars\nInformation Systems\nLanding Craft Coxswain\nMedical Assistant\nMetalsmith\nMilitary Police\nMountain Leader\nPlatoon Weapons Instructor\nPhysical Training Instructor (PTI)\nReconnaissance Operator\nSignaller\nSpecial Forces Communicator\nSwimmer Canoeist\nStores Accountant\nTelecommunications Technician (Tels Tech)\nVehicle Mechanic (VM)\nYeoman of Signals\n\nOfficer specialisations (recently decreased from 7 to 3)\nLanding Craft Officer\nMountain Leader\nSignals Officer\n\nTraining for these specialisations may be undertaken at CTCRM or in a tri-service training centre such as the Defence School of Transport at Leconfield, the Defence School of Electronic and Mechanical Engineering (DSEME) at MOD Lyneham, Wiltshire, Defence Helicopter Flying School (pilots/aircrew) or the Defence School of Policing and Guarding.\n\nSome marines are trained in military parachuting to allow flexibility of insertion methods for all force elements. Marines complete this training at RAF Brize Norton but are not required to undergo Pre-Parachute Selection Course (P-Company) training due to the arduous nature of the commando course they have already completed.\n\nSee also\n Royal Marines\n P company\n Special Boat Service#Recruitment, selection and training\n\nReferences\n\nSelection\nRoyal Marines training\nMilitary selection in the United Kingdom", "The  is a hybrid electric vehicle that is manufactured and marketed by Honda. Its first generation was a two-door, two passenger liftback (1999\u20132006) and in its second generation was a four-door, five passenger liftback (2009\u20132014). In its third generation, it became a four-door sedan (2018\u20132022). It was Honda's first model with Integrated Motor Assist system and the most fuel efficient gasoline-powered car available in the U.S. without plug-in capability \u2014 for the length of its production run.\n\nHonda introduced the second-generation Insight in Japan in February 2009 and in the United States on March 24, 2009. The Insight was the least expensive hybrid available in the US.\nIn December 2010, Honda introduced a less expensive base model for the 2011 model year. The Insight was launched in April 2009 in the UK as the lowest priced hybrid on the market and became the best selling hybrid for the month.\n\nThe Insight ranked as the top-selling vehicle in Japan for the month of April 2009, a first for a hybrid model. During its first twelve months after first available in the Japanese market, the second-generation Insight sold 143,015 units around the world. In July 2014, Honda announced the end of production of the Insight for the 2015 model, together with the Honda FCX Clarity hydrogen fuel-cell car and the Honda Fit EV electric car.\n\nAt the 2018 North American International Auto Show, Honda announced the third-generation Honda Insight prototype, based on the tenth-generation Honda Civic sedan. Unlike the previous Insight, it was a traditional sedan, not a five-door liftback. The third-generation Insight went on sale later that year.\n\nIn April 2022, Honda announced that the Insight would be discontinued after the 2022 model year, with production ending in June. It will be replaced by a new Civic Hybrid.\n\nFirst generation (ZE1; 1999)\n\nHistory\nBased on the Honda J-VX concept car unveiled at the 1997 Tokyo Motor Show, the Insight was introduced in Japan in November 1999 as the first production vehicle to feature Honda's Integrated Motor Assist system. In the following month, December 1999, the Insight became the first hybrid available in North America, followed seven months later by the Toyota Prius.\n\nThe Insight featured optimized aerodynamics and a lightweight aluminum structure to maximize fuel efficiency and minimize emissions. Until 2015, the first generation Insight ranks as the most fuel-efficient United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) certified gasoline-fueled vehicle, with a highway rating of  and combined city/highway rating of .\n\nDesign\n\nThe Honda Insight is a subcompact liftback  in length with a wheelbase of  a height of  and a width of . The first-generation Insight was manufactured as a two-seater, launching in a single trim level with a manual transmission and optional air conditioning. In the second year of production two trim levels were available: manual transmission with air conditioning, and continuously variable transmission (CVT) with air conditioning. The only major change during its life span was the introduction of a trunk-mounted, front-controlled, multiple-disc CD changer.\n\nIn addition to its hybrid drive system, the Insight was small, light and streamlined \u2014 with a drag-coefficient of 0.25. At the time of production, it was the most aerodynamic production car to be built.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe gasoline engine is a , 1.0-liter, ECA series 3-cylinder unit providing lean burn operation with an air-to-fuel ratio that can reach 25.8 to 1. The engine uses lightweight aluminum, magnesium, and plastic to minimize weight. The electrical motor assist adds another  (at 3000 rpm) and a maximum of 36 pound-feet (49 Nm) of torque when called on, resulting in  at 5700 rpm and  of torque at 2000 rpm, with the aim to boost performance to the level of a typical 1.5 L gasoline engine. It also acts as a generator during deceleration and braking to recharge the vehicle's batteries, and as the Insight's starter motor. (This improves fuel efficiency and extends the lifetime and fade resistance of the brakes, without adding unsprung weight). When the car is not moving, for example at a stop light, the engine shuts off. Power steering is electric, reducing accessory drag.\n\nThe Insight uses the first generation of Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid technology. (The next generation, used in the Honda Civic Hybrid, is much more space-efficient.) The Insight's electric assist is an ultrathin 60\u00a0mm (about 2.4\u00a0inches) brushless 10-kW electric motor located on the crankshaft. Located behind the seats are a series of 120 commercial grade \"D\" sized 1.2 V NiMH batteries wired to provide a nominal 144 V DC and a capacity of 6.5 AH. During heavy acceleration, the NiMH batteries drive the electric motor, providing additional power; during deceleration, the motor acts as a generator and recharges the batteries using a process called regenerative braking. A computer control module regulates how much power comes from the internal combustion engine, and how much from the electric motor; in the CVT variant, it also finds the optimal gear ratio. The digital displays on the dashboard display fuel consumption instantaneously. On the manual transmission up and down arrows suggest when to shift gears. Dashboard gauges monitor the current battery status, instantaneous fuel consumption, and mode of the electric motor \u2014 standby, engine assist or charging the batteries. High pressure ( / ), low rolling resistance tires and the use of low viscosity \"0W-20\" synthetic oil enhance fuel economy.\n\nThe original Insight had a conventional manual transmission. Starting with the 2001 model, a CVT variant of the Insight was available; the CVT is similar to that used in the Honda Civic Hybrid and the Honda Logo. A traditional transmission shifts between a fixed set of engine-to-wheel ratios; however, a CVT allows for an infinite set of ratios between its lowest gear and its highest. A feature shared by the two hybrids (and now appearing in others) is the ability to automatically turn off the engine when the vehicle is at a stop (and restart it upon movement). Since it is more powerful than most starters of conventional cars, the Insight's electric motor can start the engine nearly instantaneously. The Integrated Motor Assist is run by an \"Intelligent Power Unit (IPU)\", a desktop computer-sized box. The Intelligent Power Unit, the Power control Unit, the Electronic Control Unit, the vehicle's batteries, DC-to-DC converter and a high-voltage inverter are all located under the cargo floor of the vehicle, behind the seats.\n\nHonda increased the vehicle's fuel efficiency using aluminum and plastic extensively to reduce the vehicle's weight. The basic structure is a new, lightweight aluminum monocoque, reinforced in key areas with aluminum extrusions joined at cast aluminum lugs. Stamped aluminum panels are welded onto this structure to form an extremely light and rigid platform for the drivetrain and suspension. The Insight has a body weight less than half that of the contemporary Civic 3-door, with increased torsional rigidity by 38% and bending rigidity by 13%. Honda built the Insight with aluminum front brake calipers and rear brake drums, and with a largely aluminum suspension, in addition to standard aluminum wheels; reducing the ratio of un-sprung to sprung weight as well as the total weight. The fuel tank is plastic; the engine mounts are aluminum; and the exhaust is a small, thin wall pipe. Its compact spare is also aluminum. The Insight weighed  in manual transmission form without air conditioning,  with manual transmission and air conditioning, or  with CVT and air conditioning.\n\nThe Insight has a coefficient of drag of 0.25. The absence of a rear seat allows the body to taper just behind the driver and the rear track is 110\u00a0mm (approximately 4.3 inches) narrower than the front track.\n\nThe CVT-equipped Insight is classified as a super-low emissions vehicle. The Insight features low emissions: the California Air Resources Board gave the 5-speed model a ULEV rating, and the CVT model earned a SULEV rating \u2013 the 5-speed model's lean-burn ability traded increased efficiency for slightly higher NOx emissions.\n\nManufacturing\nThe Insight was assembled at the Honda factory in Suzuka, Japan, where the Honda NSX and the Honda S2000 were also assembled. The Insight and the NSX are aluminum-bodied, while the S2000 employs a steel body with aluminum hood.\n\nAt the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show, Honda introduced the concept car Honda IMAS, an extremely fuel-efficient and lightweight hybrid car made of aluminum and carbon fiber, which was perceived by most observers to be the future direction where the Insight was heading.\n\nWith its aluminum body and frame, the Insight was an expensive car to produce and was never designed for high-volume sales. Instead, it was designed to be a real world test car for hybrid technology and a gauge to new consumer driving habits. With an aerodynamic fuel-saving shape similar to its predecessor, the Honda CR-X, and some unconventional body colors it was a bit more than mainstream car buyers could handle, preferring more conservative styles. Production halted announced in May 2006, with plans announced to replace Insight with a new hybrid car, smaller than the eighth generation Civic, but not earlier than in 2009. Ahead of this announcement, Honda stopped selling Insight in the UK, for example, as early as December 2005.\n\nTo fill the market niche void, in 2002 Honda rolled out a hybrid version of the Honda Civic \u2013 Honda Civic Hybrid, followed by Toyota's redesign of the Prius in 2003 as a 2004 model.\n\nSales\nHonda had originally planned to sell 6,500 first generation Insights each year of production, but in the end achieved total global cumulative sales of 17,020 units over 7 years, split geographically as follows:\n\nUS market\nThe Insight was the first mass-produced hybrid automobile sold in the United States, achieving  per its then current United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) highway rating. Other hybrids soon followed, with the Toyota Prius arriving in June 2000.\n\nFuel efficiency\nThe first generation Insight was the most fuel efficient gasoline-powered car available in the U.S. without plug-in capability for the length of its production run and up until December 2015, when it was surpassed by the 2016 Toyota Prius Eco. The Insight earned an EPA fuel economy estimate of  in highway driving,  city. With air conditioning it was  and . With a CVT it was /.\n\nThe EPA changed the way it estimated fuel economy starting with the 2008 model year.  The revised fuel economy ratings for the 2000 Insight with manual shift 5-speed under the updated testing are  in highway driving,  city, and  combined city/highway.\n\nInsight owners who are \"hypermilers\" compete to achieve maximum travel distance with each refueling. Upon the Insight's release, Honda challenged several automotive magazines to a competition to see who could obtain the best fuel efficiency on the  drive from Columbus, Ohio to Detroit. The contest was won by Car and Driver magazine, which rigged a box behind a Ford Excursion, and had the Insight drive within the confines of the box. With much less wind resistance, the Insight made the trip with a fuel consumption of , while averaging . A two-year test of an Insight with air conditioning, driven , averaged . The New York Times noted that \"[if] you drive the car badly, you will get bad mileage.\"\n\nIn the EU fuel economy tests, the Insight achieved a combined efficiency figure  with an Extra-Urban figure of  and Urban figure of .) This remains unbeaten in the UK market for a gasoline car. The Insight has an official  emissions figure of 80\u00a0g/km which is still the lowest of any UK market car. It was also the only car to fall into the VED band A (up to 100g/km ), introduced in 2005, until 2008 when other manufacturers started developing cars to benefit from the tax free status.\n\nUsage incentives\nUnder the Energy Policy Act of 2005 in the United States, the Honda Insight was eligible for a US$1,450 tax credit.\n\nCars registered in the UK after 2001 qualified for free road tax because of their low CO2 emissions (2000 registered cars would be taxed on the lower rate of the old system based on engine size). As a hybrid, the Insight did also qualify for an exemption from the London Congestion Charge. However, in December 2010 this changed such that hybrids no longer gained automatic exception, instead cars emitting less than 100g/km CO2 and meeting the January 2005 Euro 4 emissions standard. The Insight being homologated as a 2000 vehicle, and hence not Euro 4 compliant, meant it no longer meets the criteria.\n\nMotorsport\nA Honda Insight won five races and the Class A championship in the Formula 1000 Rally in the United Kingdom in 2006. In 2011, the Insight was asked to step down from the Formula 1000 Rally Championship after dominating the first three rallies, it went on to compete and win the hybrid electric vehicle class of the RAC Future Car Challenge from Brighton to London by consuming just .\n\nReplacement battery pack\nAs of June 2008 in the U.S., according to Honda, there are fewer than 200 battery failures beyond warranty coverage out of more than 100,000 hybrids sold.\n\nAs of 1 June 2008, the replacement battery costs US$1,968 and installation is around US$900.\n\nBy 2010, multiple aftermarket large capacity replacement NiMH battery packs, including GreenTec Auto, YABO Power, BumbleBee Batteries and Hybrid ReVolt, among others.\n\nSafety \nRated by the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) in 2001\n\nSecond generation (ZE2/ZE3; 2009)\n\nIn 2009, Honda introduced its second-generation Insight based on an all-new, 5-passenger, 5-door, dedicated hybrid platform, which was also later used for the Honda CR-Z. The concept version of the Insight liftback hybrid electric vehicle had made its public debut at the 2008 Paris Motor Show. and its North American debut at the Los Angeles Auto Show. In the US, the new Insight is classified as a compact car based on its interior volume.\n\nHistory\n\nThe 2010 Honda Insight was specifically designed to make hybrid technology more affordable to a wide range of buyers. Departing from the first generation Insight's two-seat configuration, the 2010 Insight is a 5-passenger, 5-door dedicated hybrid vehicle that includes the fifth generation of Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid powertrain.\n\nThe Insight was facelifted in 2010 in the United Kingdom and in 2011 for the 2012 model year in the United States, with updates to the suspension, styling and interior. There are revisions to the recoil rate of the springs, change of the rear camber angles and alterations to the rear suspension brace and adjusting mounts. As a result, Honda promised better ride, handling and stability. Interior changes include revisions to the dashboard, seat fabric, and some plastics. The air vents received a chrome surround and a silver garnish now adorns the door sills.\n \nIn 2013, Honda of Japan offered for sale two Insights: base Insight and Insight Exclusive with a CR-Z engine with CVT transmission. The base Insight had the 1.3-liter LDA engine which was offered in 2010 Insight; the 1.5-liter LEA Engine was installed in the Insight Exclusive. The base Insight had the 1.3-liter LDA engine with two trim levels: G and L. The Insight Exclusive had the 1.5-liter LEA engine with two trim Levels: XG and XL. The 2013 Insight Exclusive received revised front bumper, side skirts, revised rear bumper lower valance and 16-inch alloy wheels with 185/55R16 V-rated tires.  The XG trim level had 15-inch steel wheels or 15-inch alloy wheels with 185/60R15 H-rated tires. The 2014 Insight Exclusive received two trims levels of XL with level one receives 15-inch alloy wheels and different colors. XL level two receives 16-inch alloy wheels, fog lights, navigation, and different colors.  The XG trim level received 15-inch steel wheels and different colors.  The 1.5-liter LEA engine is same as the Honda CR-Z with 4 valves per cylinder and has slightly less gas mileage when compared to the 1.3-liter LDA engine.\n\nDesign\nHonda chose a 5-door hatchback configuration for the second Insight. The wedge-shaped body assists aerodynamics and reduces drag for improved fuel economy. The 5-passenger accommodations enhance marketability and the overall vehicle shape, as Honda puts it, is \u201cclearly identifiable as a hybrid.\u201d\n\nThe wedge shape of the second-generation Insight has been praised by many automotive journalists for its similarities with the more successful and older second-generation Toyota Prius.\n\nThe Insight's exterior design merges design cues from both the first generation Insight (the tapered tail and triangular taillights) and Honda's production hydrogen fuel cell vehicle, the FCX Clarity (the low hood, six-point front grille, and wedge-shaped profile).\n\nThe interior of the new Insight includes a variation of the two-tier instrument panel first introduced on the 2006 Honda Civic. In this arrangement, a digital speedometer is mounted high on the instrument panel within the driver's normal line-of-sight for ease of visibility. An analog tachometer, fuel gauge, hybrid assist gauge, and Multi-Information Display are housed in the lower tier.\n\nPowertrain\nThe new Insight includes Honda's fifth generation of its Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid system. This system mates an internal combustion engine with an electric motor mounted directly to the engine's crankshaft between the engine and transmission. Honda states that this configuration is less complex, lower cost, and compact enough to accommodate a wide range of vehicle sizes when compared to competing hybrid powertrains. Honda has used previous generations of this IMA system on all of its production hybrid vehicles including the original Insight, Civic Hybrid, and Accord Hybrid. Advanced development has allowed the Insight's IMA system to be 19 percent smaller and 28 percent lighter than the previous generation IMA used in the existing Civic Hybrid.\n\nThe Insight's IMA includes a high-efficiency, lightweight, low-friction 1.3-liter SOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine rated for  at 5800 rpm and  of torque from 1000 to 1700 rpm. The high torque at low rpm is made possible by the electric motor which contributes up to  at 1500 rpm and  of torque at 1000 rpm to the powertrain, assisting in acceleration and some steady state cruising situations at low-to-mid vehicle speeds. The motor acts as a generator during braking, steady cruising, gentle deceleration and coasting in order to recharge the IMA battery. The motor also serves as the engine starter, quickly spinning the engine to idle speed after Idle Stop and during normal vehicle starting. The system will automatically switch to a back-up, conventional 12-volt starter to start the engine if the IMA system is disabled or if the car is started at extreme cold temperatures. As an additional safety feature, Honda's hybrid configuration allows the car to operate like a conventional, gasoline-engine vehicle even if the IMA hybrid-electric motor system is completely disabled.\n\nThe 2013-2014 Honda Exclusive Model Code-ZE3: is powered by a  i-VTEC SOHC inline-4 engine, designated as LEA, with Honda's Integrated Motor Assist (IMA) hybrid-electric system. the continuously variable transmission (CVT) is standard equipment. The system delivers a combined peak output of  at 6000\u00a0rpm and  at 1000 to 1500\u00a0rpm ( on CVT-equipped models). The gasoline engine contributes  at 6000\u00a0rpm and  at 4800\u00a0rpm. \n\nThe Insight's Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) provides infinite ratios to keep the engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward gear ratios are infinitely variable between 3.172\u20130.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted behind the steering wheel allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT's gear ratios are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor to stay in their most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT's variable gear ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.\n\nIn order to allow the powertrain computer to optimize performance under every driving condition, the Insight's accelerator pedal is a \u201cdrive-by-wire\u201d type that uses an electronic position sensor instead of the conventional metal cable that usually connects the pedal to the engine's throttle body. In the drive-by-wire system, the engine's throttle body is controlled by the powertrain computer in response to the accelerator pedal position\u2014allowing the computer to determine the optimal throttle body, fuel, and CVT settings based on the accelerator pedal position and its rate of travel.\n\nCar and Driver magazine performed a comparison between the 2010 Honda Insight and the 2010 Toyota Prius. In this test, the Insight achieved 0\u201360\u00a0mph in 10.3 seconds (Prius, 10.0 seconds), the quarter mile in 17.9 seconds at 78\u00a0mph (Prius, 17.6 at 79\u00a0mph), and 70\u20130\u00a0mph braking in 181 feet (Prius, 182 feet). The Insight's average fuel economy during a 600-mile controlled evaluation was  (Prius, ). Overall, Car and Driver selected the Insight as their preferred vehicle due to its \"fun-to-drive\" qualities including superior handling, steering, braking, and paddle-shifted transmission.\n\nIMA battery\nThe Insight's IMA is powered by a flat, nickel-metal hydride battery pack located below the cargo floor between the rear wheels. The 84 module battery is manufactured by Sanyo Electric and provides a nominal system voltage of 100.8 volts with a nominal capacity of 5.75 ampere hours. The power density of the modules is 30 percent greater than in the second generation Civic Hybrid. The battery is recharged automatically by scavenging engine power, when needed, and by regenerative braking when the car is decelerating. The power management electronics, battery modules, and cooling system are all self-contained within the IMA battery pack.\n\nHonda ECO ASSIST System\nThe system monitors and displays the positive or negative effect of a driving style on the vehicle's fuel economy.\n\nAs a visual aid, the background of the Insight's digital speedometer glows green when the car is being driven in an efficient manner. Somewhat less-efficient driving makes the meter glow blue-green. Aggressive starts and stops that consume extra fuel make the meter glow blue. By observing the color shift of the speedometer background, the driver receives assistance in developing driving habits that typically enhance fuel economy.\n\nIn addition, ECO ASSIST includes a dedicated ECON button that enables the driver to initiate a range of functions that increase the fuel economy of the IMA system via a single button press. In ECON mode, the driver trades off a measure of performance for enhanced fuel economy but gains the following advantages:\n Increases the potential for engaging the Idle Stop feature sooner\n Operates air conditioning more in recirculation mode\n Reduces automatic climate control blower fan speed\n Optimizes throttle angle input and CVT operation\n Limits power and torque by approximately 4 percent (full responsiveness is provided at wide-open-throttle)\n\nOverall, ECO ASSIST is designed to assist the driver in adopting a balanced approach between efficient highway commuting and efficient city driving. However, the EPA found during fuel economy testing that using the ECO ASSIST mode \"registered no effect\" on its fuel economy rating. \"It relaxes throttle response, so the test driver simply compensates with additional throttle to achieve the required speeds.\"\n\nThe multi-information display, located in the center of the tachometer, can be toggled through nine different screens of vehicle information including instantaneous fuel economy, hybrid system schematic, trip computer, and ECO Guide. The ECO Guide display includes a real-time graphic that provides a target zone for acceleration and deceleration in order to achieve maximum fuel economy. When the ignition switch is turned off, a summary screen displays a scoring function that encourages drivers to take an interest in developing fuel-efficient driving habits over the long term. In this manner, drivers can earn additional \u2018leaves\u2019 on a plant stem when practicing fuel saving strategies. Long-term fuel efficient driving habits ultimately earn the driver a \u2018trophy\u2019 graphic.\n\nChassis, suspension, and steering\nThe Insight's compact chassis is derived from components used in the Honda Fit. The structure of the engine compartment and front section of the chassis is almost identical to the Fit's, but with additional enhancements to aid crash protection. From the firewall aft the platform is unique to Insight.\n\nThe most significant difference between the Fit and the Insight platform is the position of the fuel tank. While the Fit locates the fuel tank under the front seats, the Insight positions the fuel tank under the rear seats. This allows the Insight's hybrid battery pack to be located in the cargo floor below the spare tire, to accommodate folding rear seats, lower roofline, and a more aerodynamic body shape.\n\nFront and rear suspension components from the Fit are used including MacPherson struts at the front and an H-shaped torsion beam at the rear to keep the load floor low. Front and rear stabilizer bars are also installed. On EX models, the 175/65-15 low-rolling resistance tires are mounted on lightweight aluminum wheels, each weighing  together with the tire.\n\nThe rack-and-pinion steering uses electric assist and allows the Insight to steer normally even when the engine is shut off in Idle Stop mode.\n\nThe braking system includes four-channel ABS, electronic brake distribution, and a creep aid system to prevent the car from rolling on a hill. A brake booster pressure monitoring system monitors vacuum when the engine is shut off during Idle Stop mode. Traction control and vehicle stability assist are also included. The front brakes are single-piston sliding caliper with a one-piece ventilated rotor. Drum brakes are used in the rear.\n\nEnhanced efficiency air conditioning system\nThe air conditioning system on the new Insight has an expanded thermodynamic range compared to conventional systems. Unlike the separate low pressure and high pressure refrigerant pipes used in conventional systems, the Insight has its low pressure cold pipe enclosing the high pressure hot refrigerant pipe that allows the cold refrigerant on its way back to the engine bay to cool the warm refrigerant traveling to the cabin. A unique, spiral groove along the outside of the inner pipe increases the surface area and therefore the efficiency of the heat transfer between the outer and inner tubes. This improves the thermal efficiency of the air-conditioning system and, as a result, less effort is required from the compressor, resulting in improved fuel efficiency.\n\nIn order to control costs, Honda decided not to include the electric-assist air conditioning compressor used in the Civic Hybrid. The Civic Hybrid's electric-assist allows the air conditioning compressor to continue running (using battery pack power) to maintain cabin temperature when the engine is shut off in Idle Stop mode. Instead, the Insight limits the duration of the Idle Stop mode during air conditioning use and restarts the engine, when needed, to maintain cabin temperature. However, when the Insight's ECON function is engaged, a longer Idle Stop time is invoked for improved fuel efficiency at the expense of rapid cabin cooling. In other words, the air conditioning stops whenever the car stops, as in stop-and-go traffic. During Idle Stop the blower continues to run albeit at a low speed.\n\n2012 facelift\n\nA facelifted Insight for Europe is shown at the 2011 Frankfurt Motor Show. Honda facelifted the Insight for 2012 model year. There are several significant changes to improve the car, including exterior, interior, driving and fuel economy.\n\nIn the exterior, Honda updates the front with larger air intakes on the lower front fascia, installs new headlights and tail lights, and has new wheel designs. The new grille comes with a blue stripe that Honda says represents the car's \u201chigh-tech hybrid identity.\u201d A thinner rear spoiler and a more compactly mounted rear wiper motor help to improve visibility through the rear window.\n\nEven though it now comes with wider 185/60R15 tires, a reduction in engine and CVT friction, improvements to the front and rear bumpers and underbody lead to a 1-mpg increase in EPA's city, highway, and combined mileage numbers.  in the city,  on the highway, and  mpg combined.\nThe aerodynamic efficiency is improved by two percent.\n\nIn the interior, the rear-seat and headliner are redesigned to add more rear legroom and headroom, improving comfort, additional sound insulation is added and the cupholders are larger. A rear camera and a 16-gigabyte flash card system now comes with the navigation system. Furthermore, the gauge cluster is refreshed.\n\nChanges in design led to excessive oil consumption that could require replacement of parts of the engine. In 2017, Honda addressed the concern in 2016 and, in 2017, extended the warranty to cover these flaws for eight years.\n\nFuel efficiency\nDespite technological advances, the fuel efficiency of the second-generation Insight was lower than that of the first because of significant increases in size, weight and power. Fuel efficiency rating according to the U.S. EPA testing methodology is: City , Highway , Combined . The 2012 model year U.S. version has minor improvements and its updated EPA fuel economy rating is: City , Highway , Combined .\n\nHonda UK state that the official UK fuel efficiency data for the Insight SE is: Urban , Extra urban , Combined  and the CO2 emissions rating is: 101 g/km, putting it in the second lowest UK vehicle excise duty band.\n\nSales and prices by country\nHonda sold 130,445 Insights worldwide in 2009.\n\nIn an interview in early February 2011, a Honda executive disclosed that Honda produced around 200,000 hybrids a year in Japan.\n\nThe Insight was removed from Honda Canada's website in November 2013. It was removed from sale in the UK mid 2014.\n\nJapan\nThe new Insight began sales in Japan on February 6, 2009. The reception in Japan exceeded Honda's original forecast of 5,000 monthly sales. This resulted as less availability to overseas markets and Honda has to start production on a second line at its Suzuka factory in mid-June to increase production from 700 units a day. In April 2009, the Honda Insight became the first gasoline-electric hybrid to be the best-selling vehicle in Japan for the month.\nAfter less than eleven months on sale, Honda sold 93,283 Insight in Japan in 2009, ranking it the fifth best-selling car for the year. In March 2010, Honda announced that the new Insight broke through 100,000 sales in the Japanese market in just one year after its introduction.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe car went on sale on March 24, 2009, in the U.S. as a 2010 model, making it the least expensive hybrid vehicle available in the United States.\n\nWithin less than ten months from its introduction, Insight total sales for 2009 in the U.S. market\nwere 20,572 units, selling more than the Fusion Hybrid (15,554 units) and the Civic Hybrid (15,119), but behind the Camry Hybrid (22,887 units) and the Toyota Prius (139,682 units).\nThe sales in the U.S. were below expectation, mainly due to the economic recession in 2008\u201309, stiff competition and a drop in gasoline prices of over one-third over the past year, eroding demand for fuel-efficient cars.\n\nIn December 2010, Honda introduced a less expensive Insight hybrid for the 2011 model year to help boost sales. For the 2011 LX model, center armrest, cruise control, USB connectivity for the audio system and floor mats are newly added. Electronic stability control and brake assist became standard across all trim levels. All models come with automatic climate control. Honda explained the move \"to make (the vehicle) more affordable for those younger customers who couldn't previously get into a hybrid.\" In 2009, Toyota promised a lower-priced version of the Prius to compete with Insight, but quietly dropped the deal for consumers.\n\nIn 2010, 20,962 Insights were sold in the country. The Insight ranked number two in all hybrid vehicle sales after the Toyota Prius, beating out the Toyota Camry Hybrid and the Ford Fusion Hybrid. From January 2011 to August 2011, cumulative sales of the Insight in the U.S. reached 13,106 units, ranking number two among hybrid sales for 2011 and outsold only by the Prius. By September 2011, cumulative sales reached 13,618 units, falling to the third place, surpassed by the Hyundai Sonata.\n\nFor the 2012 model year, upgraded upholstery, map light, and steering-wheel-mounted controls are added to LX trim; Bluetooth, automatic headlights, a premium fabric upholstery, plus a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob are added to EX trim. Rearview camera and a 16-gigabyte flash card system are added to the navigation system.\n\nIn October 2009, Consumer Reports named the Honda Insight the most reliable vehicle as it scored the highest of any vehicles in predicted reliability, according to its annual vehicles reliability survey.\n\nEurope\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nThe Honda Insight has been on sale from 4 April 2009 and early reports said it outsold its competitor by 15%. The Insight is no longer exempted from the London congestion charge. Starting from autumn 2010, revised suspension should improve ride and handling, parking sensors are added to ES model and higher trim models.\n\nAustralia\nThe Insight was launched as the lowest-priced hybrid car in Australia starting from December 2010. Its price was lower than the Civic Hybrid and the Toyota Prius.\n\nIts fuel economy is rated  in official Australian testing. Honda questions the green credentials of electric vehicles when electricity is generated from coal-fired power stations, \"For Australia, unless you're tapped into a green power source, the benefits are negligible\".\n\nThe Netherlands\nAs of March 2010, Honda has sold 2,661 units since the introduction of the Insight in April 2009 of which 847 were sold in the first three months of 2010. As of January 2010, the Honda Insight is exempt of road tax.\n\nThe sales of the Honda Insight, along with those of the Honda Civic Hybrid, helped Honda achieve their best sales result in the Netherlands since 1989.\n\nRepublic of Ireland\nBetween 2009 and 2015, The Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) 'Motorstats' (beepbeep.ie) show that there were 306 'Total New Registrations' of Honda Insights (including 27 and 5 in 2014 & 2015 respectively) with a peak of 108 in 2010 (10 in 2009). The 'Refreshed' model (new front etc.) was available in 2013.  Retail price in 2014 for the SE option was \u20ac23,495 and the ES \u20ac24,610 (kevinoleary.ie).\n\nOther Asian countries\nThe Insight was launched in South Korea in October 2010 as the lowest priced hybrid car offered by import automakers.\n\nIn Malaysia, Honda launched the Insight on December 2, 2010, at the Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show (KLIMS) 2010. It was priced slightly more than the top model Honda City. It is reported that a few hundred sales orders were received even before its launch.\n\nIn 2011, Insight was the best selling hybrid in the country with a total of 4,568 sold.\n\nReception\n\nEarly reviews praised the Insight's futuristic styling, handling, and price but noted that it was less powerful, less fuel efficient, and less comfortable than other more expensive hybrids. The Insight performed well in comparison tests administered by Motor Trend and Car and Driver. In their comparison test against the 2010 Toyota Prius, Car and Driver stated \"...the Insight proved more visceral, connected, and agile than the Prius. The Insight represents a lot of engineering bang for the buck, and the majority of its dynamics are more satisfying than the Prius\u2019s\" citing the benefits of the Insight's firm brake feel, accurate steering, and tight suspension (the latter borrowing heavily from the latest Honda Fit). It did not perform as well in Edmunds or Popular Mechanics tests. Despite a high reliability rating in Consumer Reports testing, the Insight was assigned a low score, stating that it fell short in ride quality, handling, interior noise, acceleration, refinement, rear seat access and rear visibility.\n\nAutoblog praised it for its fuel economy, tight handling, and good steering feedback, and stated \"the Insight is a shockingly fun car to drive in a spirited manner in spite of the comparatively modest thrust available.\", but criticized the Insight for its low passenger volume.\n\nAutomotive critic Jeremy Clarkson, known for his disdain for hybrid vehicles, criticized the Insight for its continuously variable transmission, engine noise, and build quality. He recognized that the price was low, but concluded that a Volkswagen Golf was a better deal.\n\nEdmunds.com praised the Insight for improving upon the formula of rival Prius and costing thousands less, but criticized it for excessive road noise, a tight back seat, and buzzy engine under hard acceleration. In addition, they state it \"is by far the most enjoyable hybrid hatchback to drive\" and praised the ride for being firm, the steering for being relatively responsive, and the seamless integration between the electric and internal combustion engine.\n\nIn 2009, Edmunds pitted a Honda Insight against other hybrids like Toyota Prius and Ford Fusion hybrid, a Volkswagen Jetta TDI automatic and a MINI Cooper with manual transmission over two days of mixed city and highway driving.\n\nIn October 2014, Top Gear magazine placed the Insight on its list of \"The worst cars you can buy right now\", describing the car as \"A \u00a320k hyper-efficient numbers merchant now surpassed by loads of diesel rivals in practically any measurement except urban quietness. The game has moved on.\"\n\nSafety\n\nDiscontinuation\nIn November 2013, Honda informed dealers in Japan that Insight production would stop. Its sales were in a \"slow death\" and its discontinuation was for the second time in ten years. On February 28, 2014, Honda officially announced ending production of the second generation Insight after the 2014 model year. With its \"unrefined powertrain and cheap interior\" the car had \"dismal sales\" especially when compared to its competition. Although it had a lower base price than the competing hybrid model, the Insight's 42 mpg estimate did not reach the 50 mpg Toyota Prius, the number that \"mattered most to potential customers.\" With a combined fuel economy rating that was now little more than that of some non-hybrid models available in the U.S. marketplace, in early 2014 there was 237 days worth of supply of Insights in contrast to the typical 60-day inventory held by automakers.\n\nThird generation (ZE4; 2018)\n\nThe third-generation Honda Insight prototype debuted at the 2018 North American International Auto Show, and the production version was unveiled at the 2018 New York International Auto Show. It is based on the tenth-generation Honda Civic sedan, and shares similar exterior and interior dimensions (although the Insight is about one inch longer than its non-hybrid counterpart). Unlike the previous Insight, it is a traditional sedan, not a five-door liftback.\n\nThe new Insight uses Honda's third generation two-motor hybrid powertrain, featuring a 1.5-liter gasoline engine that runs on Atkinson cycle combined with an electric motor and a lithium-ion battery pack.\n\nThe Insight shares the same trunk space as the tenth-generation Honda Civic sedan, as the batteries for the Insight do not impede on trunk space. The fully digital LCD instrument cluster was taken from the larger 2018 Honda Accord, and many interior styling features were taken from the tenth-generation Honda Civic Sedan, which is assembled at the same Greensburg, Indiana plant as the all-new Insight. Honda projects a  city,  highway fuel economy, and  combined rating for the 2019 Insight LX and EX trim levels, as compared to the  city,  highway, and  combined fuel economy ratings on the top Touring trim, which introduces leather seating to the Insight for the first and only time.  The difference in fuel economy between the versions is due to the higher weight and added equipment of the Touring version.\n\nThe third-generation Honda Insight went on sale at Honda dealerships in the United States in June 2018 as a 2019 model year vehicle with a retail price starting at $22,830 plus $895 destination charge. It was also launched in Mexico on September 6, 2018, and later in Japan on December 13, 2018, and went on sale on the next day.\n\nIn April 2022, Honda announced that the Insight would be discontinued after the 2022 model year, with production ending in June. A new Civic Hybrid will replace the Insight.\n\nAwards and recognition\nFirst generation\n The Insight's engine won the International Engine of the Year award for 2000, and continued to hold the \"Sub-1 liter\" size category for the next six years.\n It received the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's 2000 Climate Protection Award.\n It was named the Greenest Vehicle of the year for 2000, 2002, 2003 and 2006 by the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).\n The Insight was nominated for the North American Car of the Year award for 2001.\n Until the 2016 Toyota Prius Eco, the 2000 Insight was the most efficient EPA-certified gasoline-powered vehicle ever, with a highway rating of  and combined city/highway rating of .\n\nSecond generation\n The Insight is awarded 2009 Good Design Award from the Japan Industrial Design Promotion Organization\n The American Automobile Association (AAA) awarded the Honda Insight the Top Commuter Vehicle in 2010.\n The 2010 Insight EX was awarded Top Safety Pick 2009 from Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\n Selected among Kelley Blue Book Top 10 Green Cars for 2010.\n Selected among Kelley Blue Book Top 10 Green Cars for 2011.\n Selected among the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy Greenest Vehicles of the Year for 2010, 2011 and 2012.\n 2012 Total Cost of Ownership Award in the hybrid car category, granted by Kelly Blue Book for the lowest projected costs during initial five-year ownership period in its category.\n\nThird generation\n 2019 Green Car of the Year\n\nSee also\n Honda CR-Z\n Honda Civic Hybrid\n Honda Clarity\n List of hybrid vehicles\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Honda Insight official website\n\nInsight\nHybrid electric cars\nPartial zero-emissions vehicles\nVehicles with CVT transmission\nHatchbacks\nCars introduced in 1999\n2010s cars\nFront-wheel-drive vehicles", "Luiz Gonzaga Pereira dos Santos (aka. Gonzaga da Cacimba) was a Brazilian mass murderer who killed a family of seven in Princesa Isabel, Brazil, on June 29, 1979. He was killed on a siege on March 3, 1981.\n\nBackground\nSantos, who was enraged because his daughter had lost her virginity to one of the Jos\u00e9 Alves de Almeida family's sons, Jo\u00e3o Alves de Almeida. Jo\u00e3o was wanting to marry Santos's daughter, but the daughter had fallen in love with another man, and the engagement was undone.\n\nSantos was described as a bad character person, who lived on a group of rogues, and was interested in gambling. He was also credited with four other murders and other crimes in the states of Pernambuco and Para\u00edba.\n\nSantos was said to have a strong hatred for de Almeida family, having a quarrel on him for over five years, and had always said that he was going to have revenge.\n\nMurders\nOn approximately 6:30\u00a0p.m., June 29, 1979, Santos, armed with a revolver, entered de Almeida house in Princesa Isabel. The family was dining at the time. After he intruded Almeida's house, he ordered the family to lean against the wall, and then began shooting them, all of them fatally. Santos also searched for Jo\u00e3o, who had seduced his daughter, but was not in the house at the time. Santos then fled.\n\nOne child, Francisco de Assis de Almeida Santos, 13, hid behind a door, passed behind Santos, and escaped, running to the house of Aluisio Ferreira da Silva, circa 500 meters, Ferreira da Silva, went to the house to see what happened, and was threatened to be shot by Santos, Santos ordered to Ferreira da Silva get out of the house, saying \"se ficar na minha frente, morre tamb\u00e9m\" (If you keep standing in front of me, you die too.).\n\nEscaping with de Assis de Almeida, Ferreira da Silva contacted the authorities, on 9:15\u00a0p.m., 60 police officers, commanded by Colonel Mauricio Leite and by local Delegate Adelino Ferreira da Silva, began searching for Santos, with no success.\n\nThe victims were buried on Triunfo's Cemetery on 10:30\u00a0a.m., an employee of a bank establishment, requested donations for buying coffins for the victims, and was received by the population.\n\nAn extensive search for Santos was initiated, which finally ended on March 3, 1981.\n\nWorried because Santos was being searched for by 23,450 furious villagers, Judge Luiz Carlos Santos, who accumulated the district of Princesa Isabel, contacted Paraiba Public Security to give Santos the \"guarantees of justice\" fearing that Santos might be found and lynched by the population of the region, who were furious about the crime.\n\nSiege and death\nOn Po\u00e7\u00e3o, Pernambuco, March 3, 1981, Santos's house was surrounded by the 3rd Military Police Squad of Pernambuco and Para\u00edba state authorities, Santos resisted and began a shootout with the police, claiming that he had a child with him, and that he was not a violent criminal, that would not take his life, because he committed several crimes on regions of Pernambuco and Para\u00edba and had a preventive detention mandate, and for that reason, he wanted to leave the house dead.\n\nHe released one of his 25-year-old sons, whom he demanded to close the entire house, and said \"agora estou pronto, nunca me entregarei vivo.\" (Now I'm ready; I won't surrender alive.) For approximately 11 hours, Santos opened one of his house windows, and said he would only leave with Captain Medeiros, who approached Santos, Medeiros tried to convince the gunman to surrender to the police, Santos responded \"n\u00e3o havia jeito\" (There's no way.) and that in no way he would surrender.\n\nLearning that the gunman would not surrender with his life, Captain Medeiros ordered the Military Police Squad of Pernambuco in Garanhuns to tear gas bombs, at 14 o'clock, they requested again for Santos to surrender, but was again unsuccessful. According to seargeant Jo\u00e3o Gomes de Souza, it was finally resolved to thrown tear gas bombs onto Santos house, Santos responded the police and jumped the window of the house and began shooting at Jo\u00e3o Gomes de Souza, injuring him. This response caused the police to shoot at Santos, killing him with 20 bullets, but he couldn't be treated from his injuries.\n\nAftermath\nAfter the shootout, Santos was taken to Monteiro, Para\u00edba municipality, while Gomes de Souza was taken to the Hospital de Arcoverde, posteriorly to the Centro Hospitalar da Pol\u00edcia Militar de Pernambuco, on Derby, Recife.\n\nFor killing seven persons, Santos gained notoriety with the name \"Mata-Sete\" (Kill-Seven) or \"Monstro de Princesa\" (Princesa's Monster) given by the newspaper O Norte.\n\nA book, based on the murders of Santos, \"Mata Sete\" o monstro de Sert\u00e3o o assassino de um fam\u00edlia em Princesa Isabel, written by Antonio Patricio de Souza, was published in 1979.\n\nVictims\nJos\u00e9 Alves de Almeida, 56\nMarcionila Alves de Almeida, 56, Jos\u00e9 Alves wife\nMaria da Gloria, 18\nMaria de Fatima, 17\nMaria Aparecida, 12\nFrancisco de Assis, 10\nVital Jos\u00e9 Alves de Almeida, 7\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nExecutado em tiroteio o \"Mata Sete\", Di\u00e1rio de Pernambuco (March 6, 1981)\nBandido \u00e9 morto com 20 tiros, Di\u00e1rio do Paran\u00e1: Orgao dos Di\u00e1rios Associados (PR) - 1955 a 1983 (March 8, 1981)\n\nBibliography\nde Souza, Antonio Patricio: \"Mata Sete\" o monstro de Sert\u00e3o o assassino de um familia em Princesa Isabel; 1979.\n\nFurther reading\nQuestao de Honra, Renato Uch\u00f4a, Ana Paula Rom\u00e3o\nMata Sete: o outro lado de uma trag\u00e9dia pela honra, Miguezim de Princesa (October 26, 2008)\nNeta do Mata-Sete comenta cr\u00f4nica sobre o av\u00f4, Miguezim de Princesa (December 21, 2008)\n\n1979 in Brazil\nMass murder in 1979\n1981 in Brazil\n1981 deaths\nPeople shot dead by law enforcement officers in Brazil\nBrazilian mass murderers\nYear of birth missing\n1979 murders in Brazil", "Epistephium is a genus of flowering plants from the orchid family, Orchidaceae.

Qandil started his journalism career in the 1950s when he wrote for the Akher Sa'a (\"Last Hour\") magazine at the invitation of veteran journalist Mustafa Amin. In 1961 he began broadcasting a news show called Aqwal al-Suhuf (\"In the Press\") until 1969 when he was appointed director of the Arab Broadcasting Studios Union. In 1971 he left his post in protest at a government inspection of his technical staff. He later worked with UNESCO from 1974 to 1986, specializing in the field of international media. In 1987 he co-founded a satellite broadcasting company that later became known as MBC, where he worked for three months before leaving because of political differences with its management. Qandil briefly presented the show Ma'a Hamdi Qandil (\"With Hamdi Qandil\") for ART, but left amid disagreements between him and his managers regarding Qandil's planned interviews with Muammar Gaddafi and Tariq Aziz.\n\nHe returned to Egyptian television in 1998, hosting the current affairs and press review talk show Ra'is el-Tahrir (\"Editor-in-Chief\"). The program became one of the most popular and respected in Egypt. After apparent trouble with the state censors, Qandil moved the show to Dubai TV in 2004 under the name Qalam Rosas (\"Pencil\"). The new program was highly watched throughout the Arab world. He was forced to quit Dubai TV after criticizing Arab governments and subsequently hosted the show on the Libyan channel Al-Libiya for two months before the Libyan government cancelled it. He returned to Egypt and wrote for the Al-Masry Al-Youm newspaper and then Al-Shorouk, but his association with the latter ended as a result of a libel suit brought on by then-Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit in response to a column critical of Egyptian foreign policy written by Qandil in May 2010. The case was later dropped following the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.\n\nQandil was well known for his pan-Arabist discourse and fierce criticism of the Egyptian and other Arab governments.  According to Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies political analyst Diaa Rashwan, Qandil \"is a great Egyptian journalist and highly credible, he is bold and gives constructive criticism ... people listen to him and take what he says seriously, which is why he poses a threat\" to the government. Prior to the Egyptian revolution, Qandil co-founded the National Association for Change, a reformist group headed by Mohamed ElBaradei. From September 2012, Qandil had lent his support to the Egyptian Popular Current opposition movement.\n\nEarly life\n\nChildhood\nQandil was born in Cairo in 1936 to a father from Menoufia. He was the eldest of five children. Qandil spent much of his childhood and had his primary schooling in the Nile Delta city of Tanta. His father had moved the middle-income family to that city, where he owned a few feddans of land mostly planted with pears and grapes. Qandil's father primarily distributed them to neighbors and others close to him.\n\nDuring Qandil's boyhood, he borrowed and read books from a medical practice and a culture and sporting association in Tanta on a near weekly basis. He also learned field hockey there. Qandil was at the top of his class throughout his later school years and initially sought to enter the medical profession, a typical career aspiration for students with high marks. His mother particularly encouraged him to become a doctor. Qandil simultaneously took an interest in writing, Arabic calligraphy and foreign languages.\n\nJournalism career and education\nQandil was introduced to journalism when he began writing a secondary school research paper. During that time, he also wrote an article for the low-budget Tanta newspaper Al Ikhlas, criticizing King Farouk for spending one million pounds from the treasury to purchase a yacht called the \"Mahrousa\". He was fired soon after, but had since grown fond of journalism. Due to this new interest and his father's increasingly poor health, Qandil did not complete the first stage of his medical studies, causing his 1952 application to medical school to be rejected. He instead enrolled in the department of geology at Alexandria University. In July of that year, King Farouk was overthrown by a group of dissenting officers led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, leading to the subsequent establishment of a republican system under the presidency of leading officer Muhammad Naguib.\n\nQandil spent two months studying geology and decided to retake his high school examinations in order to enter into medical school. He performed well and was admitted to Cairo University's Qasr El-Ainy Faculty of Medicine in 1953. He continued in his studies until 1956, by which time Nasser had become president. During this period he also joined the National Guard. Together with some of his fellow students he founded his college's official magazine, which they printed through the Akhbar el-Yom publishing house. The magazine's first edition was confiscated due to an article Qandil wrote that was critical of university professors and regulations. Shortly after completing his final exams in 1956, Qandil was offered a writing position with Akher Sa'a (\"Last Hour\") magazine by its owners, the prominent journalists and brothers Mustafa Amin and Ali Amin. Mustafa employed Qandil with a salary of 15 Egyptian pounds and initially tasked him with writing the horoscope and a column that responded to letters from readers. Qandil was asked by Amin to serve as an editor for Akher Sa'a in 1961.\n\nThat year Qandil also attended the International Union of Students in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where he met Yasser Arafat, then the head of the General Union of Palestinian Students. Later in 1956 Qandil was accepted into the department of journalism, obtaining a license (bachelor's degree) in journalism in 1960. Four years later he received a diploma in journalism from the Berlin Institute. Throughout this period he wrote for the magazine Al-Tahrir, earning a salary of 25 Egyptian pounds, and also worked with Al-Jamahir magazine in Damascus.\n\nCareer in television and the UN\nIn 1961 Qandil began to work in broadcast television as the presenter of the program Aqwal al-Suhf (\"In the Press\"). In 1966 he became a media adviser to a television studio in Jordan, a role which ended after six weeks; the single broadcast of Aqwal al-Suhuf in Jordan was met with consternation from the Jordanian royal government and after Qandil was notified of this disapproval, he immediately returned to Egypt where he continued presenting the program. His position in Aqwal al-Suhuf ended in 1969 with his appointment as director of the Arab Broadcasting Stations Union (ABSU).\n\nIn early May 1971 Qandil left the ABSU after refusing to launch a disciplinary investigation of the technical team that recorded the Labor Day speech given by Anwar Sadat, who became president following Nasser's death in 1970. He left at a time when numerous broadcasters and media personalities were removed from their positions during Sadat's Corrective Revolution. However, he briefly returned to television in 1973 to announce Egypt's claimed victory in the Yom Kippur War with Israel in October of that year.\n\nQandil was appointed manager of the Department of the Free Flow of Information and Communication Policies for UNESCO in 1974. In an interview with Al-Ahram Weekly, Qandil stated that while at UNESCO he \"specialised in satellite communications and published several books and studies\" dealing with global media and broadcasting. During this time he strongly pushed to include Palestine as a member and attempted to remove the United States, the United Kingdom and Singapore from the organization. According to his own account, he was also able to master the English and French languages, and gain experience in diplomacy. He left UNESCO in 1986.\n\nTogether with partners from Egypt and the Arab world, Qandil co-founded the Eastern Satellite Communications Company in 1987. Its main purpose was to serve broadcasting station that would target Arabic-speaking communities in the Western world and to counter what Qandil perceived as Western bias in global media. However, in 1992, as a result of financial difficulties the company was sold and subsequently became the Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC). Qandil worked at MBC for roughly three months until he quit, citing political differences with the station's managers, who considered him a Nasserist. That same year, he was offered to host his own show at Arab Radio and Television (ART), but initially opted to work on a project setting up a private Egyptian station for Al-Ahram. The station was not launched and Qandil took up a position at ART in 1996 where he hosted his own show called With Hamdi Qandil. Qandil's arrangements to interview Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on the anniversary of the 1969 coup that brought him to power, and also Tariq Aziz, the vice president of Iraq at the time, aroused controversy among ART's managers. He quit thereafter.\n\nRa'is el-Tahrir and Qalam Rosas\nIn 1998 Qandil responded favorably to the invitation of Safwat El-Sherif, the Information Minister in Hosni Mubarak's government, to return to Egyptian television. In March his program Ra'is el-Tahrir (\"Editor-in-Chief\") began airing. Qandil stated he returned to Egyptian television because he felt he owed \"a debt of gratitude to the institution that built my fame when I was in my twenties. Also, working in Egypt is more immediately rewarding than anywhere else.\" With the relaxation of media restrictions during this period, Ra'is el-Tahrir became one of the most popular and respected television programs in Egypt. Describing the relative freedom afforded to the media, Qandil stated in 2001 that the situation was an improvement from when he first began the program, but \"as long as there remains a censor, we will continue to ask for more [freedom of expression].\"\n\nRa'is el-Tahrir was intended to serve as a weekly review of the pan-Arab press, but in practice the program became a medium through which Qandil expressed his opinions on various issues confronting Egypt and the Arab world, views which he claimed were representative of the popular Egyptian sentiment. Al-Ahram Weekly\u2032s Amina Elbandary wrote that during the show, Qandil spoke \"in histrionic style, his commentary replete with daring questions and remarks. Viewers are fascinated by his apparent lack of inhibition.\"\n\nIn the wake of the Second Intifada, the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation that began in 2000, the show became dominated by the conflict, which Qandil generally regarded as a campaign of Israeli aggression. He frequently broadcast the Israeli military's actions during the Intifada and called for viewers to support the uprising and boycott Israeli products. Qandil responded to a query regarding his extensive coverage of the Intifada by saying, \"How are news shows expected to react to events such as the Intifada? Are we supposed to keep silent?\"\n\nRa'is el-Tahrir later moved to Dream TV, an Egypt-based television station. Qandil continued to express his frustrations regarding the Israel and the Intifada, the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, and what he perceived as the United States' maligned intentions for the Middle East. According to author and researcher Andrew Hammond, \"The show's combination of current affairs, press reviews and talk-shows became the most talked-about television in Egypt since Al-Jazeera's al-Ittijah al-Mu'akis.\" His show on Dream TV was cancelled abruptly in early 2003 amid rumors that he had been crossing political red lines during his broadcasts, including stinging criticism of the government of Hosni Mubarak. This reasoning was dismissed by Dream TV manager Sanaa Mansour, who stated that Qandil had not been let go, was free to express himself and left the show without offering an explanation to management.\n\nIn 2004 Qandil moved to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) began hosting a program on Dubai TV called Qalam Rosas (\"Pencil\"). The program was virtually a continuation of Ra'is al-Tahrir, a highly watched show dealing with the Arab world's major political, economic and social affairs of the day. Qalam Rosas would normally open with Qandil interviewing an Arab intellectual and discussing a current event. The show would then continue to a round table discussion with other journalists analyzing various social and political events and movements concerning the citizens of the Arab world. At its closing, Qandil would summarize the show with a well-known maxim or saying. The London-based Arab Media Watch organization awarded Qandil the 2006 Media Accomplishment Award to commend him for his \"creativity and participation in the media world\" over the course of his five decade career. In 2008 Qandil was forced to leave Dubai TV for criticizing Arab leaders, while commending Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary-general of the Lebanese political party and paramilitary group Hezbollah.\n\nAfter his departure from Dubai TV he entered into a contract with Al-Libia, although he only remained with the Libyan channel for two months. Qandil's show was cancelled when the state-owned Al Jamahiriya Radio's General Authority took control of the channel. There was no official reason for the cancellation, but Qandil stated it was because of  \"instructions from high-ranking Libyan officials due to pressures from Egypt\". He was reportedly offered to present Qalam Rosas on the Hezbollah-linked Al-Manar TV in early 2009, but opted not to join citing an unclear situation regarding his contract with Al-Libia.\n\nPolitical activism and Aboul Gheit lawsuit\nAfter his brief stint on Al-Libia, Qandil returned to Egypt to write for the newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm in 2008 and later began writing for Al-Shorouk. He co-founded and served as the media spokesman for National Association for Change (NAC) headed by Mohamed ElBaradei in early 2010. The NAC's stated purpose is push for democratic and other reforms in Egypt. In May Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit brought a lawsuit for libel against Qandil in response to a critical column about Aboul Gheit and Egyptian foreign policy that Qandil wrote for Al-Shorouk, called \"The Homeland\u2019s Disgrace and that of the Citizen.\" In the column Qandil lambasted the contradictory statements made by Aboul Gheit and Egypt's ambassador to Israel, in which the latter said Israel was a friendly state, while Aboul Gheit had just previously stated that Israel was an enemy. Qandil wrote that the ambassador sought to cover up Aboul Gheit's statement, and that Aboul Gheit's words \"usually ... fall from his mouth like droppings of a torn rubbish bag\". The matter was transferred to the criminal court. His relationship with Al-Shorouk consequently ended as a result of the controversy.\n\nIn June 2010 Qandil quit his position as the NAC's media spokesman. He did not give an official reason for resigning, but was reportedly upset that ElBaradei was frequently outside of Egypt. In mid-December Qandil appeared in court and his defense team, which included his brother Assem and Gamal Eid requested that the \"biased\" court quit and that the case be transferred to a civil jurisdiction. On 24 January 2011 the court refused the referral and also refused to summon Aboul Gheit at the request of Qandil's defense team. On 25 January mass demonstrations demanding President Hosni Mubarak's downfall erupted across Egypt, eventually overthrowing the government, including Aboul Gheit, on 11 February. In April Aboul Gheit dropped the lawsuit. According to Hafez Abu Seada of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, the revolution was the clear reason Aboul Gheit withdrew the suit, and had it not occurred, \"the court could have handed [Qandil] a prison sentence.\"\n\nPolitical views\nQandil described himself as a supporter of Nasserism, which he defined not as a political affiliation, but rather an ideal of \"social justice\" and \"national liberation\" that \"goes beyond generation and class\". He did not join any of Egypt's Nasserist political parties or organizations, but viewed the era of late president Nasser as a period in which his \"generation was taught self-respect, national pride and the courage to stand up against the great powers\". Qandil was described by Hammond as a \"secular-nationalist ... embodying the 'conscience of the Arab nation'\".\n\nIn a 1999 interview Qandil stated his view that the pan-Arab media was not able to counter what he perceived as the influence of Zionism in American media and that the state of Arab media reflected the state of stagnation in the Arab world in general. Qandil was vociferously opposed to United States foreign policy in the Middle East. He referred to the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 as the \"biggest modern disaster for the Arabs since 1948,\" the year in which the newly established state of Israel defeated a coalition of Arab armies, causing a mass exodus of Palestinians from their homes.\n\nQandil supported the 2011 Egyptian revolution and called for Mubarak to step down from the start of the protests. In a lecture to students from the American University of Cairo in early March 2011, Qandil hailed the young protesters who started the revolution as \"brave\" and expressed hope that it would open an era of democracy and press freedom in Egypt. During the 2012 Egyptian presidential election, Qandil endorsed Nasserist candidate Hamdeen Sabahi after the Revolutionary Youth Coalition (RYC) announced their support for him. In late September 2012, during the post-revolution period in Egypt during Mohamed Morsi's presidency, Qandil announced his support for the Egyptian Popular Current movement founded by Sabahi. At the inaugural conference, Qandil stated that \"a major political battle\" would soon be launched for the next parliamentary elections and that Egypt's diverse make-up could never be changed.\n\nPersonal life and Death\nQandil met and married Egyptian actress Naglaa Fathi in 1992. He was married twice before. Fathi said of Qandil \"He is the first man who has fascinated me. It is not easy to bewitch me, but he did. I feel like a student when I'm with him: I discover new qualities in him every day,\" while Qandil said he felt an \"immediate chemical bond\" with Naglaa.\n\nQandil died on 31 October 2018 after a long illness, aged 82.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n1936 births\n2018 deaths\nAlexandria University alumni\nCairo University alumni\nEgyptian activists\nEgyptian Arab nationalists\nEgyptian dissidents\nEgyptian journalists\nEgyptian revolutionaries\nEgyptian socialists\nEgyptian television presenters\nNasserists\nMass media people from Cairo\nPeople from Tanta\nPeople of the Egyptian revolution of 2011", "The North Berwick Golf Club (NBGC), at North Berwick, East Lothian, was founded in 1832. It is the 13th oldest golf club in the world and only St Andrews hosts a club which has played continuously over the same course for longer. Although the NBGC was the first club in the world to allow female members, full membership rights were only granted to ladies in 2005. The club is based at the North Berwick West Links golf course.\n\nThe West Links Course at North Berwick is a true links course located on the edge of the Firth of Forth.  It is a championship course that has hosted many events over the years, including Final Qualifying for The Open Championship and the men's and women's Amateur Championships. Golf has been played over the historic West Links course since the 17th century. The 15th hole on the West Links, known as Redan, has been replicated at many courses around the world, with architects Charles B.

The town was only a short train ride from New York City, yet retained a rural character that appealed to artists. Many of Twachtman's friends came to visit him at his home; among them were Hassam, J. Alden Weir, Theodore Robinson, Henry Fitch Taylor, and Robert Reid.  For longer stays, they boarded at the Holley House (now known as the Bush-Holley House), a rambling old saltbox overlooking Cos Cob's small harbor.  \n\nDuring the winter, Twachtman and Weir taught at the Art Students League of New York.  Probably beginning in 1890, Twachtman established summer art classes in Cos Cob; Weir taught with him in 1892 and 1893.  Many of the summer students were enrolled at the Art Students League.  Among the artists who first visited Cos Cob as summer students were Elmer Livingston MacRae, Ernest Lawson, Allen Tucker, Charles Ebert, Mary Roberts Ebert, Alice Judson, and Genjiro Yeto.\n\nOther artists associated with the Cos Cob art colony include Leonard Ochtman, Mina Fonda Ochtman, Dorothy Ochtman, Edward Clark Potter, Emil Carlsen, George Wharton Edwards, and Kerr Eby.  The art colony also included many writers and editors, including Lincoln Steffens and Willa Cather. \n\nMembers of the Cos Cob art colony were deeply involved in organizing the Armory Show, the exhibition that in 1913 introduced modernist European art to a vast American audience.  The art colony formed its own hometown organization in 1911.  The Greenwich Society of Artists (now the Greenwich Art Society) held its first exhibition in 1912 at the Bruce Museum, which opened to the public for the first time on that occasion.\n\nSee also\nArt colony\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\nConnecticut Impressionist Art Trail\nGreenwich Historical Society\nBruce Museum\nGreenwich Art Society\n\nAmerican artist groups and collectives\nArtist colonies\nAmerican art movements\nAmerican Impressionism\nCultural history of the United States\nGreenwich, Connecticut\nConnecticut culture", "Anomalipes zhaoi (meaning \"Zhao Xijin's unusual foot\") is an extinct caenagnathid dinosaur discovered in China.

The annual match between Oxford and Cambridge Universities is the longest running Australian rules fixture outside Australia. The current competitions originated in 1989 and have grown to a number of local and regional leagues coordinated by AFL England. In 2018, these regional divisions were the AFL London, AFL Central & Northern England and Southern England AFL. \n\nThe sport's origins are said to be in England, specifically public school football games. Several of the sport's founders were born and educated there including J. B. Thompson, William Hammersley and James Bryant while Tom Wills held by many as the sport's founder, was educated at and played rugby with the Rugby School. The sport however struggled for decades to establish roots given the dominance of traditional football codes in rugby football and the growing popularity of soccer. Nevertheless, it was one of the first countries outside of Australia to commence regular competition during the 1920s.\n\nAustralian Football League (AFL) exhibition matches were held in London semi-annually between 1986 and 2006 (the last standalone event was held in 2012) and were well attended with attendances ranging from 4,500 to a record of 18,884 in 2005.\n\nEngland rarely competes in a standalone team, and is typically represented along with Scotland and Wales as the Great Britain team at the Australian Football International Cup (best result 6th) and AFL Europe Championship (2 titles). However, an English side has competed in several standalone tests and has been successful at the Euro Cup with 5 titles. Nevertheless, London has hosted several internationals, including the 2001 Atlantic Alliance Cup, 2005 and 2015 EU Cups and the 2016 and 2019 AFL Europe Championships.\n\nIn the AFL Bill Eason and Clive Waterhouse hold the record for the most games and goals with 220 and 386 respectively while current AFL Women's player Sabrina Frederick holds both records with 59 and 26.\n\nHistory of Australian rules football in England\n\nEnglish involvement in the game's establishment in Australia\n\nAccording to the AFL, the sport's origins were in England with public school football games being adopted by Australians in the 1850s leading to the creation of what is now known as Australian Football in Melbourne in the British Colony of Victoria in 1859. Several of the sport's founders were English including J. B. Thompson, William Hammersley and James Bryant, with Tom Wills having been educated at and played rugby football with the Rugby School.\n\nWriting to Wills in 1871, Thompson recalled that \"the Rugby, Eton, Harrow, and Winchester rules at that time (I think in 1859) came under our consideration, ... we all but unanimously agreed that regulations which suited schoolboys ... would not be patiently tolerated by grown men.\" The hardness of the playing fields around Melbourne also influenced their thinking. Even Wills, who favoured many rules of Rugby School football, saw the need for compromise. He wrote to his brother Horace: \"Rugby was not a game for us, we wanted a winter pastime but men could be harmed if thrown on the ground so we thought differently.\"\n\nWhile the game found its way to Ireland in the 1870s and there was also some awareness in England of the popularity of the game in Australia, it was not established locally until much later. This is primarily due to the growing popularity of locally developing football codes including rugby football and later British Association (soccer) which, like Australian Football, were also developing from public school football games.\n\nThe English were also heavily involved in the development of the code in the Colony of South Australia in particular John Acraman and Richard Twopeny.\n\nEarly efforts at introduction to England\nBetween 1870 and World War I many overseas students studied medicine in Scotland, and some went down to England to play the Australian Rules teams in that country.\n\nA Lancashire paper from 1881 mentions a local initiative to introduce \"Victorian Rules Football\" to England as an alternative to rugby and Association football.\n\nIn 1883, during a visit to Australia, English journalist and rugby player Richard Twopeny wrote of the game:\n\nA good football match in Melbourne is one of the sights of the world... The quality of the play... is much superior to anything the best English clubs can produce... there is much more 'style' about the play.\n\nIn 1884 H C A Harrison then known as the \"father of Australian Football\" visited London where he proposed unifying Australian rules with Rugby under a set of hybrid rules and suggested that rugby clubs adopt some of the Victorian Rules. English football officials expressed their insult at the suggestion that they \"abandon their rules to oblige an Antipodean game\".\n\nNevertheless when first proposing a football tour of Australia and New Zealand in March 1887, James Lillywhite, Alfred Shaw and Arthur Shrewsbury posited that the best way to ensure the success of the venture would be to play under the Australian rules where the sport was most popular.\n\nAustralians studying at Edinburgh University and London University formed teams and competed in London in 1888.\nSpurred on by the upcoming English football team's tour of Australia, a scratch match between Edinburgh Australians and London Australians was planned to be held at Balham on 14 April 1888. However the match was postponed citing lack of player numbers and suitability of the venue. It was finally played on 26 May 1888 at Balham, London won 4 goals to 2. There was little interest in the match outside of the Australian expat community. However the game was poorly organised and the selected ground was so out of the way that most spectators failed to find it, proving to be lost opportunity to promote the game. A return match was played on the same ground on the 30th May resulting in a draw. The match drew considerable praise in UK newspapers such as the Times and the Scotsman.\n\nBritish tours to Australia (1888\u20131914)\n\nAustralian rules football was played by a British representative rugby team which toured Australia in 1888. The team arrived in Hobart, Tasmania on 18 April. They attended a social function with the Southern Tasmanian Football Association, before going to New Zealand for a series of rugby matches.\n\nAfter they returned to Australia they again trained in Australian rules in Sydney, before leaving for Victoria in mid-June. The tour included 19 matches.  They played against several of the stronger football clubs from Melbourne including the Carlton Football Club, South Melbourne Football Club, Essendon Football Club, Fitzroy Football Club and Port Melbourne Football Club.  Additionally, they played against some strong regional Victorian clubs including two teams from the city of Ballarat: Ballarat Football Club and Ballarat Imperial Football Club, as well as two teams from the city of Bendigo: Bendigo Football Club and Sandhurst Football Club as well as playing against clubs from other regional towns including the Castlemaine Football Club, Maryborough Football Club, Horsham Football Club and Kyneton Football Club.\n\nThe team also played against several of the stronger South Australian teams including South Adelaide Football Club, Port Adelaide Football Club, Adelaide Football Club (no connection to the later Adelaide club), Norwood Football Club.  The only club from outside of Victoria or South Australia which played against them was the Maitland Football Club (from the Hunter Region in New South Wales). The British team won six matches, including a win over Port Adelaide at Adelaide Oval on 10 July 1888, and drew one.\n\nThe reigning Victorian premiers, Carlton defeated Great Britain at the MCG 14.17 to 3.8. At this stage goals and points were recorded but only goals counted in the score; for example, when Great Britain played Castlemaine under very heavy conditions they kicked 1 goal 2 points and the locals kicked 1 goal 4 points, but the match was declared a draw. Great Britain also played 35 games of rugby, making a total of 54 games in 21 weeks. A star of the team's Australian rules games was Andrew Stoddart, who captained the team for part of its tour and also captained England in cricket.\n\nThe 1888 tour had been organised by the English cricketer Arthur Shrewsbury but his involvement with Australian Rules football did not end there. He planned to have an Australian team sent to the United Kingdom to play a series of demonstration matches and to that end he looked to Scotland where he had identified possible opponents. Shrewsbury's plans are outlined in his correspondence with Alfred Shaw and Turner, the Nottingham Cricket Club Secretary.\n\nFirst Competitions \nShrewsbury suggested that the 'Edinburgh Australians' team at Edinburgh University should travel down to England to meet the Australian team in a series of demonstration matches in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Unfortunately his bold plan did not eventuate as the authorities in Australia aborted the venture and a possible expansion of Australian Rules in the UK was lost.\n\nIn 1894, a dramatic costume football match was played at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground involving prominent English celebrities Jennie Lee, Wallace Brownlow and Harry Musgrove.\n\nThere were reports from Australia that the game was being played in England between two clubs in 1903 and in 1904. By 1906 there were three clubs holding regular competition two of which were in London. The Oxford University Australian Rules Football Club was founded in 1906.\n\nAs early as 1911 the game was being played regularly at Oxford. In 1911 Oxford University captained by Alfred Clemens defeated Cambridge University captained by Ron Larking 13.9 (87) to 5.12 (42). In 1914, H C A Harrison reported that the game was being played regularly at both Oxford and Cambridge universities though few records exist of contests between 1911 and 1921.\n\nWorld War I \n\nIn 1915 a Victoria vs South Australia match was played at Portland Canteen ground at Weymouth, Dorset.\n\nIn 1916, one of the highest profile matches in the history of the game outside of Australia occurred when a match was held at the Queen's Club in London between Australian Army teams, representing the Combined Training Units and the 3rd Division, in which many senior Australian rules footballers from all over Australia took part. The match drew a large crowd and significant press coverage.\n\nAs a celebration of Australia Day January 1918, a match was held at Cambridge between London Headquarters and Australian Cadets, with London winning 80 to 63.\n\nHowever, the end of World War I saw the game outside of the universities go into hiatus.\n\nVarsity matches between Oxford and Cambridge \n\nAfter the war, in 1921, the Oxford University\u2013Cambridge University Varsity match between expatriate Australian students became an annual contest. This game is still played, and is the longest running Australian rules fixture outside Australia. The match is an official Varsity competition.  Over the years, some distinguished Australians to have played in the match include Mike Fitzpatrick, Chris Maxwell, Joe Santamaria, Sir Rod Eddington and Andrew Michelmore.\n\nMen's Results\n\nIn 2018, amid the growth of the sport in England, there was the first ever women's Australian Rules Football Varsity, ending in a tie.\n\nWomen's Results\n\nSecond World War matches\n\nThe AIF played a match in 1940 between the \"Impossibles\" and the \"Improbables\".\n\nWhen th RMS Moreton Bay returned to England after 1941 it played in advertised matches at Portsmouth.\n\nRAAF (Sunderland) vs RAF Mount Batten was played in 1943 in Plymouth. In November of the same year, a game was played in Sussex between No.11 Personnel despatch and Reception centre team based in Brighton vs RAAF Headquarters from London.\n\nTeams representing RAAF, Headquarters vs Sunderland, met in Hyde Park in 1944 in front of a sizeable crowd.  Headquarters defeated Sunderland 12.7 (79) to 5.4 (34).\n\nIn 1945, HMAS Australia defeated RAAF at Dulwich 11.12 to 10.5.\n\nIn 1948 Australia's champion axemen team announced its plans to introduce Australian rules football into England.\n\nIn 1952, a match was played at Rosslyn Park F.C. in South West London between HMAS Vengeance and English-Australians (\"the Wombats\"). The Wombats also organised a match at Cambridge.\n\nThe first local league\nIn 1967, Australian expatriates including Michael Cyril Hall and Ted Ford attempted to organise Australian Football in London. Ted engaged high-profile expatriate Australians including Rolf Harris, Alan Freeman, Barry Humphries, Neil Hawke, Keith Miller and former Australian prime minister Sir Robert Menzies to support the venture and raise publicity for it. Ford organised a charity match was played in Regent's Park in London, between local club Kensington Demons and established out of town club Oxford University. Athol Guy (who had played VFL reserves with St Kilda) also made a special appearance as a player. The match also featured England's first all-women's match between Aussie Girls and Wild Colonial Girls as a curtain raiser. The match attracted a crowd of 1,000 spectators. A follow up match between Earl's Court Magpies and Australian Dentists attracted 700 spectators. By May 7 established local teams were ready to form a local league these teams included: Australian Dentists, Australian Navy, Oxford University, Cambridge University, Kensington Demons, Earls Court Magpies and London House. In July, Royal Australian Navy (RAN) personnel played against a combined side drawn from the Earls Court Magpies; Kensington Demons and Australian Dentists in front of a crowd of 1,200 at Regent's Park. RAN personnel would go on to play against local school sides and local rugby clubs.\n\nAfter some time finding its roots, the Australian National Football League (UK) was formed which by 1970 had six teams, Victorians; Rest of Australia; Portsmouth Naval Base; Plymouth Naval Base; London Gaelic Football Club and Hampstead Rugby Club with matches played in the summer.\nThe later inclusion of two English rugby sides was helping them keep fit in the off-season. Later clubs to play in the league included the Kensington Demons, Earls Court Magpies, Oxford University Blues, Australian Dentists and Australian Navy (based in Portsmouth).\n\nIn 1972, the first exhibition match of the VFL was played at The Oval in London as part of the Carlton Football Club 1972 preseason World Tour. The match attracted 9,000 in a carnival like atmosphere. However the arrival of the spectacle of elite level VFL also saw the end of the game at the grassroots in England with no further organised competition.\n\nThe VFL/AFL annual exhibition \nBetween 1987 and 2006, VFL/AFL exhibition matches had become an almost annual event, but the only game since then being in 2012.\nWith a large number of ex-patriate Australians, interest in the game grew and small crowds of up to 10,000 were in attendance for the event in some years.\nInterest and crowds grew further with the change of the VFL to the Australian Football League. \nHighlights during this time included large crowds for the Australian Football League's West Coast Eagles v. Collingwood in 1997 with an attendance of 14,000 and the match between Richmond and Essendon in 2002 which drew 13,000.\n\nThe British Australian Rules Football League: 1989-Present\n\nIn 1989 the British Australian rules football League (BARFL) was formed. Serious competition began. A schools program was launched in 1991. One of the key people in the establishment of the competition was former professional Australian player Darren Ogier who helped introduce a rule that at least half of the club's players onfield must be non-Australian. As the competition became more popular, results were reported in Australia. From 1992, the AFL began contributing AUD $6,000 a year to the league, however withdrew its financial contributions in 1994, expressing a preference for grants to be spent on junior programs and school projects instead of the senior competition. Despite the lack of AFL support, local BARFL Grand Finals become a large event attracting attendances in the thousands, including a record crowd of 1,500 in 1999.\n\nIn 2002 a national team represented Great Britain at the Australian Football International Cup for the first time, finishing the tournament in 6th place. 2005 saw the British Bulldogs again compete in the International Cup, again finishing 6th overall.\n\nFollowing the 2005 International Cup, promising 22-year-old British Bulldog Luke Matias began playing with the Port Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League.\n\nAlso in 2005, the first Western Derby to be played outside of Australia, the West Coast Eagles v. Fremantle game was played as a pre-season test at The Oval in London, drawing a record crowd of 18,884.\n\nJunior Development programs\n\nIn 2005 the first junior development program, Aussie Rules Schools, commenced. The program, co-ordinated by the new development body Aussie Rules UK, part of Aussie Rules International was kicked off. This project has seen up to 10 English schools adopt Aussie Rules as part of the school curriculum to combat obesity.  Juniors teams have competed at the London Youth Games.\n\n2006 was a big year for Aussie Rules in England, with the admission of new clubs in Manchester, Middlesbrough and Thanet.\n\nOn 17 September 2006 history was made in Denmark when the England Dragonslayers took on the Denmark Vikings in Europe's first fully-fledged international junior Aussie Rules match.  England claimed the King Canute Cup, with England 6.10(46) defeating Denmark 0.6(6).\n\nIn July 2007, the AFL announced that the annual London exhibition match was likely to be abandoned for the year, after only the Western Bulldogs had expressed interest.\n\nIn a first in 2007, the GB Bulldogs including several past and future England players, soundly defeated Ireland in Dublin 11.15(81) to 2.9(21).\n\nAFL Britain\nIn 2008, a resolution to the divide between the two competing leagues saw a single national body, AFL Britain form, which formally affiliated to the AFL.  The BARFL was dissolved and became AFL London, while regional leagues including the Scottish Australian Rules Football League and the Welsh Australian Rules Football League affiliated with the new national body.\n\nAFL England\nIn 2012, AFL England was formed as the national governing body for Australian rules football in England, separate to AFL Scotland and AFL Wales.\n\nParticipation\nIn 2004, there were a total of around 435 senior players across 18 clubs in England.  The local league has a higher number of ex-patriate Australians compared to other countries that participate in the sport, however the league recently put in place caps on the number of expatriate players in certain divisions to improve the mix and encourage more local players.\n\nBy the end of 2007, the game had experienced substantial growth due to the placement of permanent development officers.

Afterwards, Dave King retained a record deal with Epic Records and began to work on a solo album, but began to reconsider his record deal when the label opposed his idea of bringing in traditional Irish instruments. King negotiated out of his record deal to go his own way musically soon after.\n\nIn 1993, King met guitarist Ted Hutt, bassist Jeff Peters, drummer Paul Crowder and violin player Bridget Regan and put together a rock band with a Celtic feel.  They began to play a mix of Irish traditional and rock.  Putting Dave's poetic lyrics to rocking melodies, they played at a Los Angeles pub called Molly Malone's weekly, building a small but loyal following. Together, they wrote songs such as \"Black Friday Rule\" and \"Selfish Man\", which was the beginning of Flogging Molly's sound. Ted and Jeff then left Flogging Molly because an earlier band of theirs, Reacharound, received a record deal.  Dave and Bridget began to find new members and the current band was formed.\n\nThey continued a routine of playing every Monday night at Molly Malone's. They put out a live album, Alive Behind the Green Door in 1997. In an interview with Kerrang! magazine, King stated that the band's name comes from the bar (Molly Malone's) that faithfully supported the band from the very beginning, \"We used to play there every Monday night and we felt like we were flogging it to death, so we called the band Flogging Molly.\" They were signed onto SideOneDummy Records after a show when the record company's owners attended a concert and noted their intensity.\n\nCareer\nFlogging Molly has released an independent (26f Records) live album titled Alive Behind the Green Door, as well as seven studio albums: Swagger, Drunken Lullabies, Within a Mile of Home, Float, Speed of Darkness, Life Is Good, and Anthem; and an acoustic/live DVD/cd combo Whiskey on a Sunday, which has gone platinum.  They have toured with the Warped Tour, Larry Kirwan's American Fl\u00e9adh Festival and contributed to the Rock Against Bush project. They have sold in excess of a million and a half copies of recorded output as of December 6, 2006.\n\nIn March 2007, the band released an exclusive EP through iTunes entitled Complete Control Sessions. The EP includes two new tracks, as well as acoustic versions of previously released songs.  A year later Flogging Molly released Float, an album dubbed \"one of the most important CDs of the year, if not the decade\" by Alternative Press.  Flogging Molly also recognized the album as influential to their career as their first album recorded in Ireland (though mixed in California) by producer Ryan Hewitt.  Fans met the release with great anticipation and enthusiasm, landing it at No.\u00a04 on the Billboard Top 200 Chart.  The album includes the band's first two chart singles, Requiem for a Dying Song (which hit No.\u00a035 on the Billboard Modern Rock charts) and Float (which hit No.\u00a040). Another accolade came to the band in June 2009 when their album \"Drunken Lullabies\" went gold.\n\nFlogging Molly released a live DVD/CD set called Live at the Greek Theater in March 2010.  The 3-disc set (double CD + full-length DVD) captures Flogging Molly's performance at the Greek Theatre on September 12, 2009, and includes content spanning the band's entire catalog. The band appeared in the 2011 season premiere of Austin City Limits.\n\nOn March 10, 2016, the band released their first new material in five years, a single titled \"The Hand of John L. Sullivan\", honoring the Irish-American boxer of the same name. It is also the first studio recording with new drummer Mike Alonso. Life Is Good was released the following year and the band's follow-up to that was 2022's Anthem.\n\nSalty Dog Cruises (2015\u2013present) \nFrom March 13 to 16, 2015, Flogging Molly began hosting a yearly Caribbean cruise. The 2015 Salty Dog Cruise Cruise featured shows by the band and many others, over three days leaving from Miami to Nassau and Great Stirrup Cay on the Norwegian Sky. All bands performed two times on the stages throughout the ship or on the special stage set on Norwegian's private island of Great Stirrup Cay.\n\nIn 2016, from March 18 to 21, the second yearly cruise took the same itinerary on the same ship and hosted, among others, Rancid, Fishbone, Frank Turner, Street Dogs and The Tossers.\n\nIn 2017, the Enchantment of the Seas hosted the third annual cruise that left on March 10 to Coco Cay and Nassau, until coming back to Miami on March 13. The guests invited by the band were NOFX, DeVotchKa, Less Than Jake, The English Beat, The Skatalites, The Bouncing Souls, Dylan Walshe and many others.\n\nOn August 21, 2017, the band announced that the 2018 cruise will take place April 20\u201323, leaving from Miami, sailing to Key West and to Great Stirrup Cay. Originally, the cruise was supposed to take place on the Enchantment of the Seas as in 2017; however, the ship was changed and the Norwegian Sky has been announced. The line-up includes The Offspring, Buzzcocks, The Vandals, Lagwagon, and Mad Caddies, among others.\n\nMusical style\nFlogging Molly's music is influenced by various artists, such as The Dubliners, The Pogues, Horslips, Johnny Cash, The Clash. The album Within a Mile of Home is dedicated to the memories of Cash and The Clash frontman Joe Strummer.\n\nTheir music ranges from boisterous Celtic punk, like the pirate-themed \"Salty Dog\", \"Cruel Mistress\", and \"Seven Deadly Sins\" or the defiant \"What's Left of the Flag\", \"Drunken Lullabies\", and \"Rebels of the Sacred Heart\" to more somber songs like \"Far Away Boys\", \"The Son Never Shines (On Closed Doors)\", \"Life in a Tenement Square\" and \"Float\". Lyrics typically touch on subjects such as Ireland and its history, drinking, poverty, politics, love, and death and include several references to the Catholic Church. \"What's Left of the Flag\" and \"The Likes of You Again\" were written as tributes to Dave King's father, who died when King was a child.\n\nMembers\n\nCurrent\n Dave King \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar, bodhr\u00e1n, banjo, spoons\n Bridget Regan \u2013 violin, tin whistle, backing and lead vocals\n Dennis Casey \u2013 guitar, vocals\n Matt Hensley \u2013 accordion, concertina\n Nathen Maxwell \u2013 bass guitar, vocals\n Spencer Swain \u2013 mandolin, banjo, guitar, vocals\n Mike Alonso \u2013 drums, percussion\n\nFormer \n John Donovan \u2013 guitar\n Tobe McCallum \u2013 mandolin\n Ted Hutt \u2013 guitar\n Jeff Peters \u2013 bass\n Paul Crowder \u2013 drums\n Gary Sullivan \u2013 drums\n George Schwindt \u2013 drums\n Bob Schmidt \u2013 mandolin/banjo, bouzouki, guitar, vocals\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n Swagger (2000)\n Drunken Lullabies (2002)\n Within a Mile of Home (2004)\n Float (2008)\n Speed of Darkness (2011)\n Life Is Good (2017)\n Anthem (2022)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nInterview with Dave King in the Irish Independent\nInterview with Bob Schmidt in 2007\nBurning Stars Interview with Flogging Molly \u2013 2006\nFlogging Molly Music Videos-Interviews-Live Performance at Roxwel\n\n1997 establishments in California\nCeltic punk groups\nIrish-American culture\nMusical groups established in 1997\nMusical groups from Los Angeles\nMusical groups from Dublin (city)\nPunk rock groups from California\nRise Records artists\nSideOneDummy Records artists", "Sorority recruitment or rush is a process in which university undergraduate women join a sorority. It is a procedure that includes a number of themed rounds in which different events are included. The rounds are followed by preference night and finally bid day in which a college student receives an invitation to join a certain sorority. The recruitment process is different at all universities and different universities have different sororities, meaning not all schools have the same chapters. Students are continually joining sororities more on college campuses as membership has gone up nationwide, growing more than 15 percent from 2008 to 2011, to 285,543 undergraduates, according to the National Panhellenic Conference, which represents 26 nationally recognized sororities. The National Panhellenic Conference also has the task of regulating sorority recruitment. The sorority houses follow specific rules to avoid infractions like staying silent before the doors are opened to the house. The week before and during recruitment, girls are not allowed to wear their Sororities Greek letters out of their sorority houses to avoid influencing a potential new member (PNM).\n\nHistory \nThe recruitment process has been around since the beginning of the formation of sororities, the first, Alpha Delta Pi being founded in 1851 at Wesleyan Female College. The recruitment into Greek life on college campuses has experienced failures that ultimately led to the adoption of a centralized matching procedure whereby a matching is determined by preference lists submitted by the potential new members. In the beginning of the formation of Greek organizations, seniors were the only ones who were eligible to join; however, more students from other grade levels desired to be a part of Greek life and it was opened to juniors, then sophomores, and finally freshmen. The process of \"lifting\", in which a Greek member would leave one chapter and join another, was not uncommon in the late 1800s and early 1900s during the start of fraternities and sororities; however, it was frowned upon. To solve this issue and others, the first intersorority conference was called to discuss interfraternity cooperation. Although resolutions were passed, they had little effect until 1928 when the National Panhellenic Council was ready to focus on a centralized system of matching and the first mention of the preferential bidding system began. This preferential bidding system has since been incorporated into the current recruitment activities of sororities.\n\nTerms \nThere are different terms used in the recruitment process, they may vary from university to university, but some of the general terms include:\n Active: A sorority woman who has been formally initiated by her chapter.\n Bid: A formal invitation to join a sorority.\n Chapter: The local group of a larger national organization, designated by a special Greek letter name.\n Legacy: A woman whose grandmother, mother or sister is an alumna or an active member of a sorority.\n House director: An adult who lives in a sorority house and cares for all chapter members like a mother-figure away from home.\n Recruitment guide: Often referred to as \u201cRho Gammas\u201d or \u201cPi Chis\u201d, lead girls through the week of recruitment, making sure they attend the correct houses, answer questions, and offer support. They are a part of a certain sorority but not allowed to reveal which one until the end of the week.\n Initiation: The formal ceremony when a woman takes an oath and becomes a full member of her sorority.\n New member: The preferred term for a pledge, a member of a sorority or fraternity who has not been initiated as an active member. \n Panhellenic: A term meaning \"all Greek.\" Refers to the local Panhellenic Council on campus.\n Pin: The sorority or fraternity membership badge.\n Potential New Member: Often referred to as PNM's, potential new member is the new term for rushee.\n\nPreparation \nSome potential new members begin preparing in the summer before the school year begins. They create a resume emphasizing community service, leadership, academics and teamwork; letters of recommendation from alumnae of each chapter, preferably on the campus in question; and learning of  letters before beginning the rush process. Some schools have no prerequisites, and girls can decide to go through the rush process weeks before. A potential new member will usually need to register for recruitment. Registration will vary by school and there may be a deadline and a fee for registration.\n\nRecruitment guides \nPNMs will be assigned a recruitment guide to lead them through the week\u2019s activities and assist the women by answering question and giving moral support. The program of recruitment guides was developed by the National Panhellenic Council to provide support for the potential new members before, during, and after the recruitment process. These guides are called \"Rho Gammas,\" \"Pi Chis,\" \"Gamma Chis\" or something similar, but all have the same task no matter the title.\n\nRecruitment rounds \nThe process includes a number of rounds that usually last around 5 days, with one round per day. Rush occurs at different times of years depending on the university it usually happens in early fall, mid January, and/or spring. There are different themes for each round, including philanthropy and skits. The first rounds are the shortest, getting longer each day. The beginning rounds include small conversations with sisters in the sorority, then comes philanthropy and skit rounds. Once the new member completes a round at a house she will go back to her recruitment counselor and make note of how she liked the chapter. The number of houses a new member visits narrows each day to preference night which is usually the longest and most serious round, in which a potential new member will visit only 1-3 chapter houses at a typical campus. Bid day is the final day of recruitment and can have several different outcomes: the PNM could receive a bid from her top choice, receive a bid from one of the other chapters she visited on preference night, not receive a bid, or receive a phone call offering a snap bid. Girls can either accept or deny the bids they are given, and the chapters have big celebrations welcoming the now new members into the sorority.\n\nCost \nSororities can often cost a considerable amount of money in order to join. Most schools make you pay for just rushing, as some sororities give out shirts and sometimes a little food. Once in the sorority there are more payments. There is a date function every semester, semi in the fall and formal in the spring. Each one of these events requires the sorority to rent  a place that can hold all sorority members, and potentially their dates. Every sorority has a sisterhood planner in charge of organising all  sisterhood activities. Each sorority is also required to pay some money to CPC, the head of sororities.\n\nCriticism \nSeveral sororities were criticized for their methods of recruitment. One notable incident was a recruitment video of Alpha Phi from the University of Alabama. The video was compared to Girls Gone Wild and was criticized by several for its lack of diversity and for its apparent sexism. The video was later removed from their YouTube channel. Another notable incident was a viral recruitment video of Alpha Delta Pi from the University of Texas where many individuals stack on top of each other behind their sorority house door. Many individuals on Twitter were horrified by the videos, some even comparing the recruitment method to the Gates of Hell. The sorority was also criticized for their lack of diversity.\n\nReferences\n\nSororities\nRecruitment", "Camelids are members of the biological family Camelidae, the only currently living family in the suborder Tylopoda. The seven extant members of this group are: dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, wild Bactrian camels,  llamas, alpacas, vicu\u00f1as, and guanacos. Camelids are even-toed ungulates classified in the order Cetartiodactyla, along with species like whales, pigs, deer, cattle, and antelopes.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nCamelids are large, strictly herbivorous animals with slender necks and long legs. They differ from ruminants in a number of ways. Their dentition show traces of vestigial central incisors in the incisive bone, and the third incisors have developed into canine-like tusks. Camelids also have true canine teeth and tusk-like premolars, which are separated from the molars by a gap. The musculature of the hind limbs differs from those of other ungulates in that the legs are attached to the body only at the top of the thigh, rather than attached by skin and muscle from the knee upwards. Because of this, camelids have to lie down by resting on their knees with their legs tucked underneath their bodies. They have three-chambered stomachs, rather than four-chambered ones; their upper lips are split in two, with each part separately mobile; and, uniquely among mammals, their red blood cells are elliptical. They also have a unique type of antibodies, which lack the light chain, in addition to the normal antibodies found in other mammals. These so-called heavy-chain antibodies are being used to develop single-domain antibodies with potential pharmaceutical applications.\n\nCamelids do not have hooves; rather, they have two-toed feet with toenails and soft foot pads (Tylopoda is Greek for \"padded foot\"). Most of the weight of the animal rests on these tough, leathery sole pads. The South American camelids have adapted to the steep and rocky terrain by adjusting the pads on their toes to maintain grip. The surface area of Camels foot pads can increase with increasing velocity in order to reduce pressure on the feet and larger members of the camelid species will usually have larger pad area to help distribute weight across the foot. Many fossil camelids were unguligrade and probably hooved, in contrast to all living species.\n\nCamelids are behaviorally similar in many ways, including their walking gait, in which both legs on the same side are moved simultaneously. While running, camelids engage a unique \"running pace gait\" in which limbs on the same side move in the same pattern they walk, with both left legs moving and then both right, this ensures that the fore and hind limb will not collide while in fast motion. During this motion there is a moment where all four limbs are off the ground at the same time. Consequently, camelids large enough for human beings to ride have a typical swaying motion.\n\nDromedary camels, bactrian camels, llamas, and alpacas are all induced ovulators.\n\nThe three Afro-Asian camel species have developed extensive adaptations to their lives in harsh, near-waterless environments. Wild populations of the Bactrian camel are even able to drink brackish water, and some herds live in nuclear test areas.\n\nComparative table of the seven extant species in the family Camelidae:\n\nEvolution\n\nCamelids are unusual in that their modern distribution is almost the inverse of their area of origin. Camelids first appeared very early in the evolution of the even-toed ungulates, around 50 to 40 million years ago during the middle Eocene, in present-day North America. Among the earliest camelids was the rabbit-sized Protylopus, which still had four toes on each foot. By the late Eocene, around 35 million years ago, camelids such as Poebrotherium had lost the two lateral toes, and were about the size of a modern goat.\n\nThe family diversified and prospered, but remained confined to the North American continent until only about two to three million years ago, when representatives arrived in Asia, and (as part of the Great American Interchange that followed the formation of the Isthmus of Panama) South America. A high arctic camel from this time period has been documented in the far northern reaches of Canada.\n\nThe original camelids of North America remained common until the quite recent geological past, but then disappeared, possibly as a result of hunting or habitat alterations by the earliest human settlers, and possibly as a result of changing environmental conditions after the last ice age, or a combination of these factors. Three species groups survived: the dromedary of northern Africa and southwest Asia; the Bactrian camel of central Asia; and the South American group, which has now diverged into a range of forms that are closely related, but usually classified as four species: llamas, alpacas, guanacos, and vicu\u00f1as.  Camelids were domesticated by early Andean peoples, and remain in use today.\n\nFossil camelids show a wider variety than their modern counterparts. One North American genus, Titanotylopus, stood 3.5 m at the shoulder, compared with about 2 m for the largest modern camelids. Other extinct camelids included small, gazelle-like animals, such as Stenomylus. Finally, a number of very tall, giraffe-like camelids were adapted to feeding on leaves from high trees, including such genera as Aepycamelus and Oxydactylus.\n\nWhether the wild Bactrian camel (Camelus ferus) is in fact a distinct species or a subspecies (Camelus bactrianus ferus) is still debated. The divergence date is 0.7 million years ago, long before the start of domestication.\n\nScientific classification\n\nFamily Camelidae\n \u2020Subfamily Poebrotheriinae\n \u2020Subfamily Miolabinae\n \u2020Subfamily Stenomylinae\n \u2020Subfamily Floridatragulinae\n Subfamily Camelinae\n Tribe Lamini\n Genus: Lama\n Llama, Lama glama\n Guanaco, Lama guanicoe\n Alpaca, Lama pacos\n Vicu\u00f1a, Lama vicugna\n Genus: Hemiauchenia\n \u2020Hemiauchenia macrocephala\n \u2020Hemiauchenia minima\n \u2020Hemiauchenia blancoensis\n \u2020Hemiauchenia vera\n \u2020Hemiauchenia paradoxa\n Genus Palaeolama\n \u2020Palaeolama mirifica\n Tribe Camelini\n Genus: Camelus\n Bactrian camel, Camelus bactrianus\n Dromedary, Camelus dromedarius\n Wild Bactrian camel, Camelus ferus\n \u2020Syrian camel, Camelus moreli\n \u2020Camelus sivalensis\nGenus: Camelops\n \u2020Camelops hesternus\nGenus: Paracamelus\n \u2020Paracamelus gigas\n\nPhylogeny\n\nExtinct genera\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Pictures of camelid species\n\n \nExtant Lutetian first appearances\nMammal families\nTaxa named by John Edward Gray\nTylopoda", "This Disaster: Live in London is New Found Glory's second DVD, and first live DVD. The DVD features a show that they performed at The Forum in London, England, on August 31, 2004, as well as many extras including a behind-the-scenes look on their tours and acoustic radio performances.\n\nThe DVD's title is derived from the song \"This Disaster\" off the band's fourth album, Catalyst (2004). It is most likely that the title was chosen, because in the middle of the band's set the main power to the venue went out.\n\nContent\n\nLive at the Forum, London, England\nWhat makes this show so unique is that during the show while the band was playing \"Dressed to Kill\", the main power to the venue went out. As a result, the band could not continue their performance. However, in an effort to keep the show going, the band played two acoustic songs while the power was being restored, namely \"My Friends over You\" and \"I Don't Wanna Know\". After finishing the song, the power was restored and the band continued their set as planned, including full band versions of both songs.\n\nSetlist\n\nThis Disaster\nThe cameras filming the concert were not affected by the blackout. Thus, the DVD's second section features a montage of the 45 minute footage of New Found Glory's efforts to continue the show.

Smith is known for supposedly being the player the Falcons drafted with the pick they acquired for Brett Favre in a trade with the Green Bay Packers. Contrary to popular belief, Smith was not drafted with the pick but rather another pick the Falcons had at their disposal.\n\nSouthern Mississippi \nA receiver turned running back, Smith rushed for 1,703 yards at Southern Mississippi and scored 12 touchdowns in three seasons. Favre was Smith's quarterback the first two seasons of his college career.\n\nNFL career \nSmith was chosen in the first round (19th overall) in the 1992 NFL Draft by the Falcons. Legend has it that Atlanta acquired this pick from Green Bay in exchange for Brett Favre, but Favre was actually traded for the 17th pick in the 1992 draft. Atlanta later traded this pick to the Dallas Cowboys. Atlanta received the 19th pick in the draft, which they used to draft Smith.\n Falcons Head Coach Jerry Glanville wanted the team to draft a defensive back and was unhappy with the choice of a running back.\n\nSmith got to his first training camp late, after a five-day holdout. He signed a $2.5 million contract, which was the richest in team history at the time. During his rookie season, he led the team with 87 carries and began returning kicks and punts.\n\nBut by his second year, still not in the favor of Glanville, Smith never played an offensive snap. The same thing happened the following season and Smith found himself a free agent after the 1994 season.\n\nSmith signed with the expansion Carolina Panthers, but broke his tibia and fibula in a preseason game against the Chicago Bears. He was placed on injured reserve and released the following offseason when his leg hadn't fully healed.\n\nSmith spent a season in the Canadian Football League with the Toronto Argonauts as an attempt to revive his NFL career. He was signed the following offseason with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1999, but Smith's career was officially over after he \"popped\" his hamstring and the Eagles released him on May 4, 1999,\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Smith claimed to be at peace with his NFL career being labeled a \"bust.\" \"I didn't go into the game to be a bust on purpose,\" Smith said. \"Sometimes, things just work out that way, you know.

That legislation established a state boating agency dedicated to all aspects of recreational boating and a special fund (Harbors and Watercraft Revolving Fund) to fund the division\u2019s activities. The division receives no General Fund support.\n\nThe division brings together a body of knowledge as the state\u2019s expert in recreational boating-related matters, including public access, safety and education, marine law enforcement, and consumer and environmental protection.\n\nFor example, DBW is responsible for planning, developing, and improving facilities on state-owned and state-managed properties, including those on State Parks and State Water Project properties.  It also provides funding so that local agencies can renew deteriorated facilities or develop new public access.  In addition, the division is heavily involved in furthering environmentally sound boating practices through its clean and green programs.\n\nDBW conducts and sponsors oceanographic research in marina pollution, sea level, wave measurement, modeling and prediction, beach processes, and coastal flooding and erosion, as they relate to boating facilities, access, safety, and education, and beach restoration and coastal protection. Close cooperation with Scripps Institution of Oceanography facilitate these activities.\n\nThe division serves all types of recreational boaters statewide.  California has about 2.6 million recreational boats and over 4 million recreational boaters.  Recreational boating annually contributes several billion dollars to the state\u2019s economy.\n\nThe current Deputy Director of California Division of Boating and Waterways is Ms. Lynn Sadler.\n\nUnits\nThe Division of Boating and Waterways is made of two Enforcement and Environmental units to coordinate the division's responsibilities. Between them, both units oversee 17 programs, ranging from boater safety rules to species control.\n\nPollution controls\nCalifornia Division of Boating and Waterways heavily regulates the use of carbureted and electronic-injection two-stroke engines manufactured prior to 1989 in California waters, considering them high-emission polluters. Due to emission standards, The division has banned their use on several lakes throughout the state. Direct injection two-stroke engines made since 1989, however, are permitted on the state's waterways with some non-emission standard exceptions.\n\nNon-native species removal\nCalifornia Division of Boating and Waterways' Aquatic Pest Control Program has since 1982 targeted to control water hyacinth from state waters. A native of the Amazon River in South America, the water hyacinth was introduced to the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta in the early 20th century.

Riahl has been declared one of the greatest art collectors since 1945.\n\nRiahi started out as an engineer and road-builder, eventually acquiring an apartment in France. He started collecting in the 1970s, in order to furnish the apartment in the grandest possible tradition. Riahi swiftly achieved notoriety among French dealers due to regularly outbidding them on the finest pieces at auction. Among the master craftsmen represented in the collection were Andr\u00e9 Charles Boulle, the \u00e9b\u00e9nistes Bernard II van Risamburgh and Martin Carlin; and carpets and tapestry from the Savonnerie and Gobelins manufactories. Some of his individual pieces included wall brackets from Marie Antoinette's bedroom and a cabinet made for the Comtesse de Provence. 59 pieces from the collection, including pieces with royal provenances, were purchased in 2000 by Christie's and estimated to raise 25 million dollars when auctioned off.

The painting currently hangs in a private home in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.\nIn speaking of his uncle, Captain Frederick, family historian William Frederick Parker notes:\n\"His voyages took him chiefly to the Indian and China seas and the Mediterranean, in the barque 'Walton.'

These enzymes are alternatively referred to as retinoid isomerases.\n\nThis enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically cis-trans isomerases.  The systematic name of this enzyme class is all-trans-retinol 11-cis-trans-isomerase. This enzyme is also called all-trans-retinol isomerase.  This enzyme participates in retinol metabolism.\n\nIn vertebrates, RPE65 is the active retinol isomerase in the visual cycle. A lack of RPE65 function results in congenital blindness in children (specifically Leber congenital amaurosis).

It is about  in diameter and was formed 31-32 million years ago during the Early Oligocene. The impacting object is estimated to have been approximately  in diameter. Devon Island itself is composed of Paleozoic shale and siltstone overlying gneissic bedrock. When the crater formed, the shale and siltstone were peeled back to expose the basement; material from as deep as  has been identified.\n\nDescription \n\nAt 75\u00b0 north latitude, it is one of the highest-latitude impact craters known. The temperature is below the freezing point of water for much of the year, and the limited vegetation is slow-growing, leading to very little weathering. For this reason Haughton retains many geological features that lower-latitude craters lose to erosion.\n\nBecause Haughton's geology and climatology are as close to Mars-like as can be had on Earth, Haughton and its environs have been dubbed by scientists working there as \"Mars on Earth.\" For example, the centre of the crater contains impact breccia (ejected rock which has fallen back into the impact zone and partially re-welded) that is permeated with permafrost, thus creating a close analogue to what may be expected at crater sites on a cold, wet Mars. The Mars Institute and the SETI Institute operate the Haughton\u2013Mars Project at this site, designed to test many of the challenges of life and work on Mars.

The traditional approach to the development of structures is to address the load-carrying function and other functional requirements separately. Recently, however, there has been increased interest in the development of load-bearing materials and structures which have integral non-load-bearing functions, guided by recent discoveries about how multifunctional biological systems work.\n\nIntroduction\nWith conventional structural materials, it has been difficult to achieve simultaneous improvement in multiple structural functions, but the increasing use of composite materials has been driven in part by the potential for such improvements. The multi-functions can vary from mechanical to electrical and thermal functions. The most widely used composites have polymer matrix materials, which are typically poor conductors. Enhanced conductivity could be achieved with reinforcing the composite with carbon nanotubes for instance.\n\nFunctions\nAmong the many functions that can be attained are electrical/thermal conductivity, sensing and actuation, energy harvesting/storage, self-healing capability, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and recyclability and biodegradability. See also functionally graded materials which are composite materials where the composition or the microstructure are locally varied so that a certain variation of the local material properties is achieved. However, functionally graded materials can be designed for specific function and applications.\n\nMany applications such as re-configurable aircraft wings, shape-changing aerodynamic panels for flow control, variable geometry engine exhausts, turbine blade, wind turbine configuration at different wind speed, microelectromechanical systems (micro-switches), mechanical memory cells, valves, micropumps, flexible direction panel position in solar cells, innovative architecture (adaptive shape panels for roofs and windows), flexible and foldable electronic devices and optics (shape changing mirrors for active focusing in adaptive optical systems).\n\nReferences \n\nComposite materials\nStructural engineering\nMechanics\nMechanical engineering\nEmerging technologies", "Marcos Ant\u00f4nio Costa (born 18 December 1978), simply known as Preto, is a retired Brazilian footballer who played as a defender.\n\nHonours\nSantos\nCampeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A: 2002, 2004\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPreto at playmakerstats.com (English version of ogol.com.br)\n\n1978 births\nLiving people\nSportspeople from Maranh\u00e3o\nBrazilian footballers\nAssociation football defenders\nCampeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players\nSantos FC players", "Hlengiwe Ntombela (born 12 April 1991), better known as HLE, is a South African gospel singer and songwriter.

He served as the head football coach at the University of Washington (1920), the University of South Dakota (1922\u20131926), at the University of California, Berkeley (1935\u20131944), compiling a career college football record of 80\u201366\u20135.  At California, Allison amassed a 58\u201342\u20132 record. In 1937 and 1938, he guided the Bears to back-to-back ten-win seasons, which was at the time the only such occurrence in school history. His 1937 squad, dubbed the \"Thunder Team\", won the 1938 Rose Bowl, was named the national champions by a number of selectors, and is considered by some sportswriters to have been the best team in school history.  While at Washington, Allison also coached the baseball team, in 1920 and 1921, and the basketball team, in 1920.\n\nEarly life\nAllison was born in Mazeppa, Minnesota and raised in Anoka, Minnesota by Alexander J. & Elizabeth Hauxhurst Allison.  He attended Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, where he played football. He graduated from Carleton in 1917. He also served for four years in the United States Army.\n\nCoaching career\nIn its obituary for Allison, The Milwaukee Journal called him a Knute Rockne disciple who mostly relied on the single-wing offense. Allison's first coaching experience came on the staff of his former college coach Claude J. Hunt, at the University of Washington in 1919. The following season, he took over as head coach, and his team amassed a 1\u20135 record. At Washington, Allison also spent time as the head coach of the baseball and basketball teams. In 1920, he led the basketball team to a 7\u20138 record, and in 1920 and 1921, he led the baseball team to 7\u20134\u20131 and 8\u20134 records, respectively.\n\nAllison served as head coach at the University of South Dakota from 1922 to 1926 and compiled a 21\u201319\u20133 mark. He then moved on to the University of Wisconsin, where he was the head boxing instructor, football line coach, and assistant athletic director from 1927 until 1931. That year, he went to the University of California, Berkeley to take a position as an assistant football coach.\n\nHe became the head coach at California for the 1935 season. The ESPN College Football Encyclopedia rates the 1937 California team as the best in school history. Allison led the \"Thunder Team\" (a play on California's \"Wonder Teams\" of the 1920s) to the Rose Bowl, where they defeated Alabama, 13\u20130, to finish with a 10\u20130\u20131 record. ESPN noted that team relied on \"power runs and a nasty, opportunistic defense that allowed only 33\u00a0points and shut out seven teams.\" Allison's final record at California was 58\u201342\u20132. Aside from being named national champions in 1937, under Allison, California captured a share of the Pacific Coast Conference title in 1935 and 1938, and outright in 1937.\n\nIn April 1945, after Allison declined the opportunity to resign, California notified him that they would not renew his expiring contract. The Pittsburgh Press noted that after peaking in 1937, \"five dismal years were climaxed last fall\" in 1944, and that his firing was \"no surprise since it was well known that an influential alumni bloc was lobbying against him on grounds that he shackled good material with a dull offense.\"\n\nLater life\nFrom about 1946 until his death, Allison was the director of industrial relations at the Oakland Naval Supply Center. Allison died on December 12, 1961, in the Alta Bates Hospital in Oakland, California hospital, to which he had been confined for three weeks because of a heart ailment. He was 69 years old and survived by his wife Ethyl.\n\nHead coaching record\n\nFootball\n\nReferences\n\n1892 births\n1961 deaths\nAmerican football ends\nCalifornia Golden Bears football coaches\nCarleton Knights football players\nSouth Dakota Coyotes athletic directors\nSouth Dakota Coyotes football coaches\nWashington Huskies baseball coaches\nWashington Huskies football coaches\nWashington Huskies men's basketball coaches\nWisconsin Badgers athletic directors\nWisconsin Badgers football coaches\nUnited States Army soldiers\nSportspeople from the Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul metropolitan area\nSportspeople from Oakland, California\nPeople from Anoka, Minnesota\nPeople from Wabasha County, Minnesota\nCoaches of American football from Minnesota\nPlayers of American football from Minnesota\nBasketball coaches from Minnesota\nUnited States Navy civilians\nPlayers of American football from Oakland, California", "Jorge Roberto D\u00edaz Price (born 27 July 1998) is a Mexican professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Liga MX club Le\u00f3n.\n\nCareer statistics\n\nClub\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nJorge Diaz at Debut Club Leon\n\n1998 births\nLiving people\nFootballers from Quintana Roo\nAssociation football midfielders\nMexican footballers\nMexican expatriate footballers\nClub Le\u00f3n footballers\nEverton de Vi\u00f1a del Mar footballers\nLiga MX players\nChilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players\nExpatriate footballers in Chile", "George Costanza (July 4, 1888 \u2013 November 27, 1952) was a state representative in Massachusetts serving from 1921 until 1922, representing the Fifth Suffolk District.

Lucas Formula Three British Championship, the mobile telephone company Cellnet, who were already sponsoring the Intersport Racing team, organised an invitation non championship, end of season race. This race was held at Brands Hatch, on 9 October.  Although Avon Tyres still supplied the tyres, Cellnet decided to increase interest by introducing a compulsory wheel change mid-race. They requested that the changes should be visible to spectators, so Avon came up with the idea of painting the whole side of the tyres.\n\nReport\n\nEntry\nA total of 39 F3 cars were entered for this event.

With a full grid of 28 cars, the start was quite a fraught affair as various drivers, with nothing to lose, took risks not usually attempted during a championship race. This ended in tears for some. Damon Hill didn\u2019t even finish the first lap and Kenny Br\u00e4ck and Jonathan Bancroft went out in the next lap. During the race, the wheel changing was full of drama as the teams finally put into practice what they had been learning, some successfully, others not!

He won fifteen British Classics in a 35-year career, the last ten years of which were spent as jockey to King George V. He was known for riding a slow, waiting race, and also for having a short temper which regularly saw him at odds with his trainers and owners.\n\nEarly life\n\nChilds was born in Chantilly into a racing family. His father had ridden successfully in France, and his grandfather had worked at the stables of Peter Price in Newmarket. There were also four brothers \u2013 Albert, Arthur, Charles and Henry \u2013 who all became jockeys. Joe would go on to be the foremost of these, but Charles would win the 1916 St. Leger on Hurry On, two years before Joe himself won it. Albert became a trainer in Marseilles, France.\n\nChilds was married to Emily Lavis (1887\u20131914) like Childs she was from a racing family, born in Chantilly and the daughter of racing trainer Alfred James Lavis, they had one child Joey who died in 1916.\n\nCareer\n\nApprenticeship (1900\u20131902)\n\nChilds spent his apprenticeship at Phantom House, Newmarket, the stables of trainer, Tom Jennings Jr. His first winner came for Jennings in 1900 at the now defunct Lincoln Racecourse on a horse called Lady Alicia. He was aged just 16. The following year he took a step up, winning the Royal Hunt Cup at Royal Ascot on Stealaway and the final November Handicap to be run at the New Barns course in Manchester before it was relocated. In 1902, he won the valuable Great Metropolitan Handicap at Epsom and the Goodwood Cup. Yet, despite these wins, he was beginning to struggle to get rides. He no longer qualified for the apprentice weight allowance, which made him a less attractive proposition as a jockey.  In response to this problem, Jennings arranged for him to spend some time in Europe.\n\nIn Europe (1903\u20131913)\n\nThe first French trainer for whom Childs rode was Maurice Caillault.  However, the quick temper which would come to mark his career cost him his job with Caillaut, as it would do with the owner Duc de Gramont and during a short lived spell at an Italian stable.\n\nHe was back and forth across the Channel for a couple of years before he finally found success on a third spell in France. Deputising for the sidelined George Bellhouse, he won the 1908 Grand Prix de Paris for owner William K. Vanderbilt on Northeast.  The following year he won the 1909 renewal on board Verdun for Prince Murat and he began to surge ahead with his career. In 1908, he had ridden 75 winners; in 1909, 90.\n\nHis next battle was with his weight. This problem was solved with a move to Germany to ride for the von Weinbergs, with a contract that was not dependent on his meeting a specific weight.  The Weinberg brothers' trainer was Fred Darling and Childs formed a partnership with that trainer which would provide him with some of his most memorable victories, although given Childs' temper the relationship was often stormy.\n\nHe was based back in France in 1912, when he won his first Classic on Mirska for his old trainer, Tom Jennings. His successful spell in Europe, though, was cut short by the advent of World War I. He escaped France on the last train before the Germans arrived and had to leave all his possessions behind.\n\nWar years and beyond (1914\u20131924)\nDuring the war, Childs initially joined the Royal Flying Corps but not taking to the disciplined regime he transferred to the 4th Hussars. Generously, they allowed him a good deal of leave so he could meet riding commitments.\n\nThis allowed him to partner the top class filly Fifinella in her classic year of 1916. It has been suggested he threw away a winning chance on her when she was 11/10 favourite for the 1,000 Guineas, hitting her as she played up in the stalls. As a result, she sulked during the race and failed to perform.  Her finest moments, however, were yet to come. In the substitute Derby of that year, into which she had been entered because that year's crop of colts was so weak, she again acted obstreperously. This time however, she deigned to respond to Childs and in the final furlong he poked through a gap to win by a neck.  She went on to be only the fourth, and to date, last, filly to do the Oaks-Derby double.\n\nIn 1918 even better was to come for Childs on the colt Gainsborough. Trained by Alec Taylor Jr. in Manton, Wiltshire, Gainsborough won the 2,000 Guineas, Derby and St. Leger with Childs as the jockey, becoming one of the few horses to have won the British Triple Crown. He would later repay the Hussars by donating his riding fees for 1918 to the regiment, including those for Gainsborough.  Taylor would be one of the trainers for whom Childs would continue to ride after the war.\n\nIn 1919 he rode Bayuda to victory in the Oaks for Lady Douglas. He also rode Buchan, the odds-on favourite, for Lord Astor in the 1919 St. Leger, but got beaten. A dispute with Astor's racing manager over the matter meant he never rode for Astor again.  In 1921, Childs became stable jockey to Cecil Boyd-Rochfort. The next few years were quieter by comparison with the big race victories of the war years, but in 1921 he won the Oaks on Love in Idleness and the Grand Prix de Paris on Lemonora, both for Joseph Watson (later Baron Manton), who had purchased the Manton estate. He also won a St Leger on Polemarch (1921) and a July Cup on Golden Corn (1923).\n\nRoyal Jockey (1925\u20131935)\n\nFrom 1925 until his retirement in 1935, Childs would be jockey to King George V whose horses were trained by William Rose Jarvis. Childs would refer to the King as 'My Guv'nor' and would toast him with champagne every time he won on one of his horses.  In the King's colours he would have 'the proudest moment of his life' when he won the 1929 1,000 Guineas on Scuttle. As a reward, the King presented Childs with a cane, which would become his most treasured possession. The 'best race he ever rode' was for the King too \u2013 the 1933 Hardwicke Stakes on Limelight.\n\nChilds won the 1926 Derby on Coronach for one of his long standing trainers, Fred Darling, one of the few trainers who could handle him.  The horse's aristocratic owner was Lord Woolavington. Childs and Coronach won the race with an uncharacteristically fast, front-running performance, Childs being known as a 'hold up' jockey. This resulted in a famous post-race comment, \"The bastard ran away with me\".  No jockey would win a Derby with the same front running tactic until Steve Cauthen on Slip Anchor in 1985.\n\nBy the end of his career Childs was often found riding for Cecil Boyd-Rochfort and it was for him he rode his last classic winner \u2013 Brown Betty in the 1933 1,000 Guineas. Childs had by this time mellowed considerably with age.  His final winner was at Derby in November 1935 and in December of that year he was invited to Buckingham Palace at the request of the King. In all, Childs had achieved 15 British Classic wins, two Grand Prix de Paris and one French Derby.\n\nRiding style\n\nChilds was a tall jockey, described as \"lithe and beetle-browed\"  These 'beetles' \u2013 his dark, bushy eyebrows \u2013 were said to give \"broody, bellicose expression to a hair-trigger temper.\"  In turn, the temper was one of the defining characteristics of his racecourse performances. He would regularly argue with officials, once reportedly accusing a steward of lying: \"You were not at the gate and could not have seen the incident as you stated you did.\"\n\nThe other characteristic of his racing was the way he tended to win a race with \"a well-timed rush\". He is described as \"The most fanatical exponent of waiting\". or, put less favourably, \"A waiting race was the only one he could ride\"  This \"lack of versatility\" is cited as the one thing that prevented Childs being a really great jockey.\n\nDespite this, he was renowned in some quarters for his horsemanship and judgement in a race. He is said to have ridden some of his best races at Newmarket\n\nRetirement\n\nOn retirement he managed Portsmouth Greyhound Stadium and dabbled in horse ownership with trainer George Digby.  He also kept a small stud at Nazeing in Essex.  He published an autobiography, My Racing Reminiscences in 1952 and died in Portsmouth in 1958. In 1999, more than 40 years after his death, he was ranked 11th in the Racing Post list of Top 50 jockeys of the 20th century. John Crouch was appointed as king's jockey when Childs retired.\n\nMajor wins\n\nClassic races\n Great Britain\n 1,000 Guineas \u2013 (2) \u2013 Scuttle (1928), Brown Betty (1933)\n 2,000 Guineas \u2013 (2) \u2013 Gainsborough (1918), Cameronian (1931)\n Epsom Oaks \u2013 (4) \u2013 Mirska (1912), Fifinella (1916), Bayuda (1919), Love in Idleness (1921)\n Epsom Derby \u2013 (3) \u2013 Fifinella (1916), Gainsborough (1918), Coronach (1926)\n St. Leger \u2013 (4) \u2013 Gainsborough (1918), Polemarch (1921), Solario (1925), Coronach (1926)\n France\n Prix du Jockey Club \u2013 Sourbier (1920)\n\nSelected other races (incomplete)\n Great Britain\n Ascot Gold Cup \u2013 Gainsborough (1918), Solario (1926), Trimdon (1931, 1932)\n Champagne Stakes \u2013 Golden Corn (1921)\n Cheveley Park Stakes \u2013 Brown Betty (1932)\n Coronation Cup \u2013 Solario (1926)\n Eclipse Stakes \u2013 Buchan (1919), Coronach (1926)\n July Cup \u2013 Golden Corn (1923)\n Ribblesdale Stakes \u2013 Sir Cosmo (1929)\n France\n Grand Prix de Paris \u2013 Northeast (1908), Verdun (1909)\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\nPathe News footage of Childs winning the 1926 Derby on Coronach\n\n1884 births\n1958 deaths\nBritish jockeys\nFrench jockeys\nPeople in greyhound racing\nFrench emigrants to the United Kingdom", "Anna Mei (10 July 1967) is a racing cyclist, mountain biker and a breaker of long-distance (24h) records.

It was first performed in 1887, seven years after his first quartet.\n\nBackground\nFaur\u00e9's previous work in the genre, the Piano Quartet No. 1, Op. 15, had been favourably received at its premiere in 1880, and was among the chamber works for which he had been awarded the Prix Chartier by the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in 1885. Little is known about the composer's reasons for writing another. It was not commissioned, and appears to have been written because Faur\u00e9 was interested in the possibilities of the piano quartet medium, and was wary of writing chamber music with no piano part. The Faur\u00e9 scholar Jean-Michel Nectoux comments that the choice of this unusual form showed the composer's desire to break new ground and be his own man. Nectoux adds that there was the advantage that the existing classical repertory contained very few top-flight piano quartets with the exception of Mozart's.\n\nIt is not certain when Faur\u00e9 began work on the Second Quartet, but writers are generally agreed that it was in either 1885 or 1886, and the work was completed in time to be premiered on 22 January 1887.  It was given at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique by Guillaume Remy (violin), Louis van Waefelghem (viola), Jules Delsart (cello) and the composer (piano).\n\nThe piece was published soon after the first performance, with a dedication to the conductor Hans von B\u00fclow.\n\nStructure\nFaur\u00e9 adopts the classical four-movement structure: an opening Allegro is followed by a scherzo, slow movement, and finale. This follows the pattern of German Romantic works such as  Schumann's Piano Quartet op. 47 and Brahms's Piano Quartet op. 25.\n\nI. Allegro molto moderato \nThe first movement, which is in classical sonata form, opens with a unison string melody accompanied by relentless piano figuration. The piano takes up the theme, after which the viola introduces an expressive variant of the main theme, and the violin transforms the variant into a more relaxed second subject. The exposition ends with a modified return of the opening theme and its pulsing accompaniment. Viola and cello introduce a new theme, molto tranquillamente, which provides a link into the central development section and returns, in its original form and then at double speed, towards the end of the section. The recapitulation begins with the first theme fortissimo, turns to G major with the viola melody, and the second subject returns on the cello and then the violin. The coda is primarily based on the opening theme but also reintroduces the molto tranquillamente melody now at double speed, and ends quietly in the major.\n\nII. Allegro molto \nThe C minor scherzo is the shortest of the four movements. It is in a fast 6/8 metre with a syncopated piano theme. Melodic material from the first movement \u2013 first its espressivo second subject and then the main theme \u2013 is transformed into a rondo. Cross-rhythms of 3/4 in a broad string melody give way to another smooth theme which forms a kind of \"trio\" interlude, although the perpetuum mobile of the main scherzo material continues behind it and carries the movement on to its conclusion.\n\nIII. Adagio non troppo \nThe third movement, Adagio non troppo, is in E-flat major. The gentle undulating piano figure with which it opens was, according to Faur\u00e9, \"a vague reverie\" inspired by a memory of the evening bells of the village of Cadirac near his childhood home. The viola solo that follows is a rhythmically modified version of the second subject from the first  movement, transformed into a gently oscillating siciliano. At the start of the middle section, the bell figure is played on the strings in a mixture of arco and pizzicato. The movement builds gradually to a fortissimo  climax  before the return of the bell motif leads the music back to pastoral quiet. At the beginning of the coda of the movement, the bell theme, given a more elaborate shape, given to the piano as an accompaniment to a cello melody. The music finishes quietly in the home key of E flat major. Nectoux says of this movement, \"The sense of space it creates, rapt and profound within a narrow range of notes, marks it out as being truly the music of silence\".\n\nIV. Finale\u2014allegro molto \nThe critic Stephen Johnson says of this movement, \"Passion and violence are again let loose \u2026 The relentless forward drive of this movement is quite unlike anything else in Faur\u00e9\". The movement sets off in fast triple time, with an insistent rising string melody together with piano triplets. The second subject, derived from the molto tranquillamente theme of the first movement,  is a vigorous theme reminiscent of a waltz. It is succeeded by a melody for viola and cello related to the trio section of the scherzo. After a development and recapitulation, there is a coda in which thematic elements from the entire quartet are glimpsed. The work ends in an emphatic G major.\n\nCritical reputation\nThe musicologist Robert Orledge comments in his 1979 biography of Faur\u00e9 that the Second Piano Quartet \"marks a significant advance on the First Quartet in the force of its expression, the greater rhythmic drive and complexity of its themes, and its deliberately unified conception\". Orledge adds that in this work \"Faure announces his full artistic maturity and the beginning of his second period\". Nectoux expresses reservations about the finale, finding the second theme \"rather on the heavy side\" and a later section \"unusually for Faur\u00e9, lacking in imagination\". Aaron Copland wrote that the Second Quartet shows the composer \"less carefree, less happy, more serious, more profound\" than in the First. To Copland the adagio was \"the crowning movement of the quartet\". He described it in a 1924 essay, as \"a long sigh of infinite tenderness, a long moment of quiet melancholy and nostalgic charm. Its beauty is a truly classic one if we define classicism as 'intensity on a background of calm'.\"\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nChamber music by Gabriel Faur\u00e9\nFaure\n1886 compositions\nCompositions in G minor", "Elba Verg\u00e9s Prats (born 24 October 1995) is a Spanish footballer who plays as a defender for Alav\u00e9s.\n\nClub career\nVerg\u00e9s started her career at Barcelona B.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nProfile at La Liga\n\n1995 births\nLiving people\nWomen's association football defenders\nSpanish women's footballers\nFootballers from Barcelona\nSportswomen from Catalonia\nFC Barcelona Femen\u00ed B players\nRCD Espanyol Femenino players\nASJ Soyaux-Charente players\nSD Eibar Femenino players\nPrimera Divisi\u00f3n (women) players\nSpanish expatriate women's footballers\nSpanish expatriate sportspeople in France\nExpatriate women's footballers in France\nFC Levante Las Planas players", "Dick Lee Hess (September 12, 1938 \u2013 September 6, 2013) was a Republican member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 78th District and was elected in 1986.

The bridge is paired with the Belle Chasse Tunnel which carries southbound LA 23.  Construction began in March 1967, and the bridge opened for traffic in September 1968. It has been plagued with mechanical issues since it opened. Commuters have had to back down off the bridge due to a malfunction.\n\nThe bridge was built to relieve traffic from the Belle Chasse Tunnel.  It was part of a parish project of four-laning Highway 23 throughout the road's entire length to Venice.  According to the Plaquemines Gazette, the $3.3 million structure was built by Plaquemines Parish using its Parish Royalty Road Fund without charge to local taxpayers.

The notoriety that resulted introduced him to his soon wife JoBeth Johnson and they moved to Klamath Falls, Oregon. Initially belonging to various denominations of Christianity, Ravellette and several of the family converted to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith between 1967 and 1970.\n\nLater divorced, Ravellette moved to Teaneck, New Jersey and then Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he rescued an elderly woman in a burning car and again won national recognition. His life is featured in a 2004 documentary, No Arms Needed: A Hero Among Us. Ravellette died in an auto accident in Eli Whitney, North Carolina three years later, in 2007.\n\nEarly life and education\nMarty Ravellette was the fourth child of the farm family of Ernest D. Ravellette and Laurene Ravellette (n\u00e9e Frohreich). He was born without arms. Faced with the challenge of this disability his family was convinced to place him at two months old at Good Shepherd Home, known today as Good Shepherd Rehabilitation Network, in Allentown, Pennsylvania. The main practice at Good Shepherd was mainstreaming, and they trained Ravellette to adapt the use of his legs, feet, arms, hand, and an early prosthetic arm he later stopped using. - who was an inspiration to Ravellette. Ravellette, while missing arms, favored his left foot like many do their left hand. Ravellete was known to entertain people with his use of feet and body to do tricks. \n\nWhile there, Ravellette attended Allentown public schools, starting with Jefferson Elementary School and then South Mountain Junior High. At age 11, Ravellette suffered burns from a fire accident. At age 16, Ravellette rejoined his family partly because he was a discipline problem but was initially barred from attending high school by an operating public school principle at the time that, as Ravellette understood it, physical handicaps were equated with mental handicaps. Ravellette's mother sued the school and produced transcripts from his public school years while living at Good Shepherd in Allentown. \n\nWhile attending an Allentown public high school, Ravellete's reputation was built by, despite lacking arms, his rebellious and confrontational attitude. He \"didn't back down\", as the 2003 documentary on him cited when fellow students picked on him. However, he said, \"For the first time, I felt like I was a cripple.\". He credited his rebelliousness with not being afraid of work, an attribute he said he developed from working on a farm, where his family did not have running water. At one point, it was Ravellette's job to fill water troughs from a hand pump. For the high school prom Ravellette recalled he was denied a date saying \"Marty, when I want to get married I want to marry a man, not half a one.\"\n\nAfter graduating circa 1957, the family moved to Oceanside, California and Ravellette ran away from home. In San Diego, Ravellette began to work in a variety of jobs. While he was unemployed in 1962, he drove from Los Angeles to his home on San Diego, where he was pulled over in a line of cars for speeding. After taking his driver's license, the officer noticed that he was handed the license by Ravellette's foot. After proving he had a valid driver's license, he let Ravellette go with a citation. The incident was covered nationally by Associated Press and was read by JoBeth Johnson in Florida, who struck up a long-distance relationship with Ravellette that grew to a marriage after Ravellette moved to Klamath Falls, Oregon in 1963. They lived there a number of years; he, a member of the Church of Christ and she a Baptist. Together they had a daughter, Nancy (who was born with arms.) and a son who died as a child in a car accident.\n\nIn 1967, after attending community college, Ravellette moved to San Diego, where he lived in a boarding house, and performed parlor tricks. There, he met Ray Estes, who pointed out he was being used for amusement by those who were not his friends. In the same period, Estes noticed he was much more agile with his feet and remarked, \"If God has seen fit to put you on earth without arms, it's up to the rest of us to accept you - not you to accept us.\" which Ravellette took as a turning point in his life. Estes and Ravellette would be long time friends. Estes had joined the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith in 1966 and Ravellette also converted to the religion in 1967. Soon his mother and wife were visible serving in the religion and the Ravellettes had a second child May 21, 1970, after they moved to Eugene, Oregon. Marcus Husayn Ravellette - \"Husayn\" is a name recognized in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed circles as the birth-name of the founder, Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. However, on June 11, 1975, Marcus was killed in an automobile accident and buried as a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed. Marty and JoBeth divorced some time afterwards. Ravellete moved to Teaneck, New Jersey, where he became a grounds keeper at the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed property there. It was near there in Paramus, New Jersey that he met the woman who would be his next wife - Maree.\n\nNorth Carolina incidents\nIn 1991, Ravellette moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where he won North Carolina's Disabled Citizen of the Year in 1994 while running a landscaping business, Hands on Landscaping. He again gained national fame when he rescued an elderly lady from a burning vehicle. He appeared on several national television shows, including Discovery Channel, which won an Award of Merit by Carolina Silver Reels and other shows though initially he had sought no publicity. Following this he had the opportunity to go back to Good Shepherd in Allentown, Pennsylvania for a reunion and began a period of reconnecting with his family while at the same time he met his future wife. He also began to speak publicly, including as a frequent guest at a journalism class of Chuck Stone at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and elsewhere, using stories of his life and physical challenges to underpin larger lessons on the benefits of diversity, justice, equality, and the unity of humankind. Inspired by his beliefs as a long-time member of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, he often quoted one of his favorite lines from Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed literature, \"Noble have I created thee; why hast thou abased thyself\" and observed that he was in a special position to serve humanity because of his differences, saying \"Why was I born? Why was I born with no arms? Now serve mankind with no arms and not yourself!\" he met Tony Melendez, a performer who similarly armless.\n\nOn November 12, 2007, Ravellette was in a car accident in southern Alamance County, North Carolina at Highway 87, where Eli Whitney, North Carolina is located. He failed to yield to an oncoming lumber truck and was ejected from the vehicle. He was not wearing a seatbelt because of his disability and died later that day at UNC Hospital just a few days after another Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed was similarly killed in an accident at the same intersection. He is buried at Maplewood Cemetery, Durham, North Carolina.\n\nAwards and special appearances\nIn 1988, he won the Governor's Trophy for an outstanding handicapped person in Oregon.\nIn 1990, he appeared on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.\nHe won the North Carolina's Disabled Citizen of the Year in 1994.\nIn 1998, he appeared on The Today Show twice (October and another date) and The Rosie O'Donnell Show. and won the Robert P. Connelly Medal for Heroism from Kiwanis.\n\nOn June 26, 1999, he was named the 28th honoree on the Wall of Honor at the Good Shepherd Home in Allentown, Pennsylvania and led the F\u00eate del la Musique parade in Carrboro, North Carolina.\n\nIn 2004, his life was featured in a documentary film, No Arms Needed: A Hero Among Us, produced and directed by Bill Hayes and written by Kirk Streb, and shown on the Discovery Channel on May 8, 2004 and elsewhere.\n\nFurther reading\n North Carolina Collection clipping file, 1990-2009 (Ravellette, Marty (1939 - 2007)), North Carolina People, Places, and Things, Wilson Library, University Library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nReferences\n\n1939 births\n2007 deaths\nAmerican Bah\u00e1'\u00eds\nAmerican people with disabilities\nConverts to the Bah\u00e1'i Faith from Protestantism\nPeople from Allentown, Pennsylvania\nPeople from Chapel Hill, North Carolina\nPeople from Oceanside, California\nPeople from San Diego\nPeople from Teaneck, New Jersey\nRoad incident deaths in North Carolina", "The Leinster League is the second tier of rugby in Leinster, behind the Leinster Senior League.

It is bounded on its north side by the nunataks south of Mount Edgell, on its south side by the Traverse Mountains and Terminus Nunatak, and at its head Prospect Glacier provides a route to the Wordie Ice Shelf. It was first surveyed in 1936 by the British Graham Land Expedition (BGLE) under John Rymill and resurveyed in 1948 by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey.

Situated within the Forth Valley, Clackmannan is  south-east of Alloa and  south of Tillicoultry. The town is within the county of Clackmannanshire, of which it was formerly the county town, until Alloa overtook it in size and importance.\n\nHistory and toponymy\n\nName and toponymy \nThe name Clackmannan may be of Brittonic origin. The first element is probably *clog, meaning \"rock, crag, cliff\" (c.f. Welsh clog), and the second is the personal name Manau, from the root man- meaning \"projecting''.\n\nThe name of the town has been said to allude to the Stone of Manau or Stone of Mannan, a pagan monument that can be seen in the town square beside the Tolbooth or Tollbooth Tower, which dates from 1592.\n\nHistory \nThe early growth of the town was due in large part to the port which lay on the banks of the tidal stretch of the River Black Devon at its confluence with the River Forth. There are now no visible signs of the port and Clackmannan now sits over a mile inland from the river. The locals tried in vain to keep their port viable by digging out the silt but to no avail. The silting of Clackmannan's port and the fact that boats could no longer access it meant that the port in Alloa came in to use instead and this led to an increase in the population of nearby Alloa see that town replace Clackmannan as the county town of Clackmannanshire in 1822.\n\nDuring the 12th century, the area formed part of the lands controlled by the abbots of Cambuskenneth. Later it became associated with the Bruce family, who, during the 14th century, built a strategic tower-house called Clackmannan Tower and in the 16th Century built a mansion alongside the tower. The mansion was demolished when local branch of the Bruces died out in 1791, although its stones may have been recycled to build the new parish church in 1815. It still stands above the town according to Historic Scotland, but entry is forbidden (because of subsidence).\n\nThe population of Clackmannan in 1841 was 1,077.\n\nA crater on asteroid 253 Mathilde is named after Clackmannan. Because Mathilde is a dark, carbonaceous body, its craters have been named after famous coalfields from across the world.\nThe Clackmannan Group is the name given to a suite of rocks of late Dinantian and Namurian age laid down during the Carboniferous period in the Midland Valley of Scotland. The war memorial was designed by Sir Robert Lorimer in 1919.\n\nArchaeological Excavation\nHeadland Archaeology completed an excavation of a prehistoric and medieval site at Meadowend Farm, Kennet which lies to the south-east of Clackmannan and was within the corridor for the new road and crossing (the Clackmannanshire Bridge) over the River Forth near Kincardine (this opened in 2008). Over two thousand fragments of prehistoric pottery were recovered from the site, the vast majority from a dense concentration of pits or postholes dated to the middle/late Neolithic period. Several structures were identified on site, the most substantial a large roundhouse with an outer ring-groove and an entrance to the south-east with an extended porch. Two large post-built roundhouses were found, and a third post-built structure contained a hearth-pit, which had been filled with fire-cracked stones and charcoal. It was hoped that radiocarbon dating would enable more precise phasing of the structures.\n\nSee also \nList of places in Clackmannanshire\nClackmannan (UK Parliament constituency)\nClackmannan F.C., ormer Scottish Football League members\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n  Clackmannan Library\n Clackmannan Tower: Clackmannan Towers Official Website\n\n \nTowns in Clackmannanshire\nGeological type localities of Scotland\nFormer county towns in Scotland\nParishes in Clackmannanshire\nLate Neolithic", "Sidney Willard (September 19, 1780 \u2013 December 6, 1856) was an American academic and politician who served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives, on the Massachusetts Governor's Council and as the second Mayor of Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nWillard was the Librarian of Harvard from 1800 to 1805.

The population was 26,377 at the 2020 census.\n\nHistory \n\nIt is believed that Burlington takes its name from the English town of Bridlington, Yorkshire, but this has never been confirmed. It was first settled in 1641, and was officially incorporated on February 28, 1799; several of the early homesteads are still standing, such as the Francis Wyman House, dating from 1666. The town is sited on the watersheds of the Ipswich, Mystic, and Shawsheen rivers. In colonial times up through the late 19th century, there was an industry in the mills along Vine Brook, which runs from Lexington to Bedford and then empties into the Shawsheen River.\n\nBurlington is now a suburban industrial town at the junction of the Boston-Merrimack corridor, but for most of its history, it was almost entirely agricultural, selling hops and rye to Boston and supplementing that income with small shoe-making shops. Early railroad expansion passed the town by (although the town was serviced by the Middlesex Turnpike), limiting its early development, and Burlington continued to cure hams for the Boston market and produce milk, fruit, and vegetables.\n\nThis picture changed drastically, however, as soon as Route 128 was built. The highway kicked off an enormous expansion, and between 1955 and 1965 Burlington was the fastest growing town in the state. In one five-year period, its population tripled as residential and commercial retail development exploded creating the town's present character. It is currently a residential and professional hub.\n\nGeography\nLocated in the Greater Boston Area of eastern Massachusetts, Burlington is bordered by Bedford on the west, Billerica on the north, Wilmington on the northeast, Woburn on the southeast, and Lexington on the south.

It borders Route 3 in Burlington to the east, Route 62 in Bedford to the north, conservation land in Lexington to the west, and Route 128 to the South. The main trailhead to the Forest is located at the intersection of Routes 3 and 62 in Bedford. A secondary trailhead can be found on Turning Mill Road in Lexington, under the power lines at the site of the future West Lexington Greenway. At the time of its purchase, the Landlocked Parcel was not protected land.  There were discussions in 2008 between the Town of Burlington and Patriot Partners to sell the land to the developer who would develop part of the forest to build a large biotechnology complex. A citizen group, Friends of the Burlington Landlocked Forest, was organized to prevent this sale and to make the Forest designated conservation land. In 2017, the Burlington Town Meeting voted to rezone the land as open space.\n Mary Cummings Park was envisioned as one of the great public parks of Greater Boston, but it fell into great neglect. This  public park on the Burlington-Woburn border was created by Mary P.C. Cummings in 1927 and was entrusted to the City of Boston to be kept forever open as a recreational park. In recent years, the City of Boston has tried to discourage public access and has investigated selling the park to fund the Rose Kennedy Greenway. The Burlington RC Flyers maintain a field in the park. The park is now managed by the Trustees of Reservation.\n The Kevin James movie Paul Blart: Mall Cop was filmed in the Burlington Mall, and scenes from the Ben Affleck movie The Company Men were filmed in an office building off of Wall Street, near Route 128.\n\nGovernment\nBurlington is governed by a 126-member representative Town Meeting (18 representatives elected per precinct) and a five-member executive Select Board.\n\nBurlington Cable Access Television (BCAT) is a non-profit Public-access television cable TV facility that was formed in 1987.

The Soviets accused Kudirka of theft of 3,000 rubles from the ship's safe. Ten hours passed. After attempts to get the U.S. State Department to provide guidance failed, Rear Admiral William B. Ellis, commander of the First Coast Guard District, ordered Commander Ralph E. Eustis to return Kudirka to the Soviets. Commander Eustis refused to subject his own crew to the task and instead permitted a detachment of Soviet seamen to board the Vigilant to return Kudirka to the Soviet ship. (The engineering crew had offered to hide Kudirka in the engine air intake shaft which could not be opened while the engines were running but the offer was declined.) This led to a change in asylum policy by the U.S. Coast Guard. Admiral Ellis and his chief of staff were given administrative punishment under Article 15 of the UCMJ. Commander Eustis was given a non-punitive letter of reprimand and assigned to shore duty.\n\nSubsequent investigations revealed that Kudirka could claim American citizenship through his mother and was allowed to come to the United States in 1974.\n\nA book detailing the incident, Day of Shame, by Algis Ruksenas, was published in 1973. The book helped spur further investigations into the incident that eventually led to Kudirka's release by the Soviets. It remains part of the reading curriculum in the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.\n\nThe incident was portrayed in a 1978 television movie, The Defection of Simas Kudirka, with Alan Arkin playing Kudirka and Donald Pleasence playing the captain of the Soviet ship. In the movie, the USCGC Decisive (WMEC 629) played the part of the Vigilant.\n\nThe incident is also portrayed in a 2020 documentary film The Jump directed by Giedr\u0117 \u017dickyt\u0117, with Simonas Kudirka as himself and Ralph E. Eustis as himself.\n\nNotable crew\nAdmiral Thomas H.

Starting with the music as a hobby in the late 90s and at the early age of 13 he became an enthusiast of the dance music genre of the moment, and passed to be a mere follower to become a producer even before starting his career as a DJ.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first years\n\nD-Mark begun in the field of the music production using a tracker production software. He led a now disappeared project called Vanian-UT to spread all of these tracks made with that software across all the Spanish territory. In 2002, Vanian-UT was known in Spain as a young producers' collective with a lot of talent, that also focused on DJing, something that caught the attention of D-Mark as well. This year, Vanian-UT released with D-Mark mixes a set of CDs for the magazine Solo Tuning.\n\n2003\u20132008\nYear 2003 was a new begin for D-Mark. Focused on his DJ side and with the Vanian-UT project running at its top, the collective begun to perform their music on several clubs and events in the zone, like regular parties at Future Club in Barcelona or the event Trancenight Summer Party at Girona in 2004.\n\n2005 was a year of changes. As new systems and computer production software became more affordable to everyone and the record deals were increasing into its members Vanian-UT was about to close, what took D-Mark to initiate and lead a new record label project called DanceDP Recordings. This idea was set up this year, but it would not come to light until the end of 2006. Meanwhile, D-Mark took his first appearance outside the zone of Catalunya, Spain, and moved to Madrid to perform a gig alongside DJ Precision and Menno de Jong, together with his friends and artists Shammu, DJ Row and the resident DJ at Future Club in Barcelona Pllo Future.\n\n2006 and 2007 were, without a doubt, the most active at the DJ and musical career of D-Mark. During this time, he carried his music through all the Spanish territory in the cities of Ibiza, Barcelona, Madrid or Valladolid, and the countries of Norway, England and Slovenia and performing together with some of the most influenced DJs of the dance scene at these years, like Above & Beyond, Lemon & Einar K or Inkfish. In 2006 he made his debut abroad, in a Ministry of Sound event at Sentrum Scene in the city of Oslo, Norway.\n\nThese years were also when D-Mark set the opening of his new record label project DanceDP Recordings. The first release of the record label and the first appearance of D-Mark in the music industry as well, Travelling EP, became unexpectedly a success: 10 weeks in a row at the top positions of the Technics/IDP/DMC Dutch Dance Charts and full reviews on the Spanish magazines Deejay and DJ1, that finally ended with the DJ Oner award No. 1 Spanish trance release and the appearance of Project Norway in the album of Dave Pearce Delirium on the label Ministry of Sound.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008 D-Mark teamed up with who would be now his best friend in the music field and his studio and DJ partner G-Sus. They two together released several remixes for artists like Tragida and Der Mystik, and their hit La Lamida del Gato Negro produced in 2008 and released in 2009 got the unexpected support of the world's top DJ Paul van Dyk.\n\n2008 is also the starting year of D-Mark's monthly radio/podcast project DanceDP Radio. The project begun with the appearances and the support of Ra\u00fal CC and David Amante the first year, until David left his music career. G-Sus joined the team in 2010, where he is currently an active part of the show.\n\n2009\u2013present\n\n2009 and 2010 were two difficult years to the personal life of D-Mark that forced him to stop the recording of his already announced album debut Driving Nowhere and to leave momentarily his musical activity, that was also affecting his record label. The album was finally discarded due to the crisis that is lately passing through the music industry, especially in Spain, and the world's economy. However, this did not stop D-Mark and G-Sus in 2009 to organize and perform a special event in Pineda de Mar, which was the one who had the biggest attendance for them of all the times in Spain, 5500 attendees.\n\n2011 is the year, as he said, of the coming back, with a new EP release and an amateur official videoclip made for what is his favourite city, Barcelona.\n\nDiscography\n\nSingles and Remixes\n\n 2011: Physical Phase \u2013 Inception (D-Mark & G-Sus Remix) \n 2011: Barcelona EP including Barcelona, Surfing the Waves and I See The Light\n 2011: Edu NRG \u2013 Return Flight (D-Mark & G-Sus Remix)\n 2010: Chimo Bayo \u2013 La Fiesta del Fuego (D-Mark's Ibiza One Night Stand Mix)\n 2009: La Lamida del Gato Negro ft.

After 1760 it was made of copper. In south Germany the kreuzer was typically worth 4 pfennigs and there were 60 kreuzers to a gulden.\n\nEarly history\nThe kreuzer goes back to a groschen coin minted in Merano in South Tyrol in 1271 (the so-called Etscher Kreuzer). Because of the double cross (German: Kreuz) on the face of the coin, it was soon given the name Kreuzer. It spread in the 15th and 16th centuries throughout the south of the German-speaking area. The Imperial Coinage Act of 1551 made them the unit for small silver coins.\n\nIn 1559 a value of 60 kreuzer to 1 gulden had been adopted throughout the southern states of the Holy Roman Empire, but the northern German states declined to join, and used groschen instead of kreuzer. The kreuzer in turn was worth about 4.2 pfennigs (\"pennies\"). Thus one (golden) gulden was worth 60 kreuzers or 252 pfennigs. Later currencies adopted a standard relationship of 240 pfennigs = 60 kreuzers = 1 gulden.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the  in 1754, two distinct Kreuzer came into being. The first, sometimes referred to as the , was worth 1/120 of a , valuing the gulden at half a . This was used in Austria-Hungary. However, the states of southern Germany adopted a smaller Kreuzer  worth 1/144 of a , thus valuing the Gulden at 5/12 of a .

It created a Supreme Court of Judicature, comprising the High Court of Justice in Ireland and the Court of Appeal in Ireland. It mirrored in Ireland the changes which the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 had made in the courts of England and Wales.\n\nProvisions\nThe Act marked the fusion of the administration of common law and equity in Ireland, although not a merger of the jurisdictions themselves. Prior to the Act coming into force a litigant had to sue in equity in the Court of Chancery and at common law in the common law courts of the Common Pleas, the Exchequer, and the Queen's Bench. Mirroring earlier legislation applying to England and Wales, the Act merged these four courts to become a single High Court of Justice in Ireland; the old courts continued as divisions of the new court. Amending legislation later abolished all but the King's Bench Division and Chancery Division of the High Court.\n\nThe Act also created a new Court of Appeal in Ireland.\n\nPartition and subsequent developments\nThe \"Supreme Court of Judicature in Ireland\" that was created by the 1877 Act was abolished by the Government of Ireland Act 1920, s. 38; in its place were established a separate Supreme Court of Judicature for each of Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, together with an overarching \"High Court of Appeal for Ireland\" with appellate jurisdiction for the whole of Ireland.  The two new Supreme Courts of Judicature were constituted on a similar basis to the court they replaced, with both being made up of a High Court of Justice and a Court of Appeal (ss. 39, 40).\n\nIrish Free State and the Republic of Ireland\nThe Irish Free State was established on 6 December 1922, comprising the territory which had been designated as Southern Ireland. Article 75 of the Constitution of the Irish Free State carried over the existing court structure for Southern Ireland; this included the courts established under the 1920 Act, with the exception of the High Court of Appeal for Ireland, which was abolished by the Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922, an act of the United Kingdom Parliament. Subsequently, the Courts of Justice Act 1924 transferred the jurisdiction of the High Court of Justice to the court of the same name created by that Act, and the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice. Both these jurisdictions have been continued by subsequent legislation.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Ireland) 1877 has not been repealed in the Republic of Ireland and thus remains part of its law; the Act was expressly preserved by the Statute Law Revision Act 2007.\n\nNorthern Ireland\nIn Northern Ireland the Act was repealed by the Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978.  However, that Act established a new Supreme Court of Judicature that is of largely the same shape as that established under the 1920 Act, although it also includes a Crown Court in Northern Ireland (which tries indictable offences). Since the establishment of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland's Supreme Court has been known as the Court of Judicature in Northern Ireland.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nCitations\n\nFurther reading\nWilliam Dwyer Ferguson and George Napier Ferguson.

He played college football at Alabama State University.\n\nEarly years\nPowe attended Mattie T. Blount High School, where he lettered in football, basketball, track and baseball. He accepted a football scholarship from Alabama State University.\n\nAlthough he was considered the fastest player on the team, he spent most of his career as a backup wide receiver, because he chose to compete in track instead of participating in spring football practice. He practiced the 100 and 200 metres.\n\nAs a sophomore in 1982, he led the team in receiving with 16 catches for 319 yards and 2 touchdowns, including a 61-yard touchdown reception and a 53-yard catch. As a junior in 1983, he posted 8 receptions for 184 yards and 2 touchdowns (62 yards and 48 yards).\n\nAs a senior, he registered 16 receptions for 314 yards and 2 touchdowns, while leading the Southwestern Athletic Conference in kickoff returns with 11 for 300 yards and a 27.3 average. In three seasons he recorded 40 receptions for 817 yards and 6 touchdowns, averaging 20.5 yards per catch.\n\nProfessional career\n\nDallas Cowboys\nPowe was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the seventh round (178th overall) of the 1985 NFL Draft, because of his speed and athletic ability. He made the team as a backup wide receiver after having a notable camp. On December 15, he had a critical 28-yard reception on a third-and-15 situation in the fourth quarter against the New York Giants, which proved to be the winning touchdown drive that clinched the division-title.\n\nHe started the season finale against the San Francisco 49ers in place of Tony Hill, posting 7 receptions for 127 yards. He finished the season with 14 receptions for 237 yards and a 16.9-yard average. He was seen as a promising player, as his 14 catches were the most by a Cowboys rookie receiver since Drew Pearson's 22 in 1973.\n\nOn September 9, 1986, he was placed on the injured reserve list, after suffering nerve damage in his neck during the season opener against the New York Giants. \n\nOn September 1, 1987, he was placed on the injured reserve list with a sprained shoulder. After the players went on a strike on the third week of the 1987 season, those contests were canceled (reducing the 16-game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. On October 7, he crossed the picket line and joined the replacement team. It was later reported that Powe was told by the Cowboys to resign from the NFL Players Association in order to receive physical therapy. He was cut on October 20, at the end of the strike, after not being able to fully recover from his previous injuries. He never played during the season.\n\nGreen Bay Packers\nOn April 23, 1988, he was signed as a free agent by the Green Bay Packers.

It was a separate municipality, but became administratively a part of Cieszyn in 1973. It lies in the Silesian Foothills in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia.\n\nThe name of the village is cultural in origins and literally means pastures in Polish, clearly suggesting the origin of the name and a role it served to citizens of Cieszyn.\n\nHistory \nThe village was first mentioned in 1565 as Pastwysky, when a dukal folwark was located here. Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Teschen, a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became part of the Habsburg monarchy.\n\nAfter Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed to the political and legal district of Cieszyn. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality dropped from 880 in 1880 to 1,680 in 1910 with a growing majority being native Polish-speakers (from 87.4% in 1880 to 97.7% in 1910) accompanied by a small German-speaking minority (at most 104 or 11.9%, then dropping to 36 or 2.2% in 1910) and Czech-speaking people (at most 6 or 0.7% in 1880). In terms of religion in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (75.4%), followed by Protestants (22.4%) and Jews (21 or 2.2%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Cieszyn Vlachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect.\n\nAfter World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish\u2013Czechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, it became a part of Poland. It was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II.

Trained by Meiko Satomura, Okuda started her career in the Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling promotion in 2006, where she originally worked under her real name and later under the ring name . In 2009, Okuda quit Sendai Girls' and affiliated herself with Team Makehen under the new ring name . After returning from a year-long hiatus due to a knee injury in March 2012, Okuda became a freelancer and began working for promotions such as Apache Pro-Wrestling Army, Universal Woman's Pro Wrestling Reina and World Woman Pro-Wrestling Diana under her real name.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\nSendai Girls' Pro Wrestling (2005\u20132009)\nOkuda first became interested in professional wrestling, when her elementary school class made a field trip to an All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) event, where she met Taka Michinoku. After deciding to become a professional wrestler herself, Okuda contemplated entering Michinoku's Kaientai Dojo wrestling school, before opting to instead train at a dojo, which concentrated entirely on training female, or joshi, wrestlers. On October 2, 2005, Okuda took part in an audition held by Meiko Satomura, and, after passing it, was admitted to the first training class of Satomura's new Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling promotion, and began training under her in Sendai the following December. Sendai Girls' held its first event on July 9, 2006, during which the promotion's first four trainees all made their debuts against joshi veterans. While the other three trainees were all defeated in their matches in five to six minutes, Okuda's debut match with Mayumi Ozaki lasted fifteen minutes, but, in the end, also ended in the trainee suffering a defeat. During the rest of the year, Okuda also suffered defeats against Chikayo Nagashima, Devil Masami and Hiroyo Matsumoto, before gaining her first win on January 10, 2007, by defeating fellow trainee Sachiko Kanari. On April 8, Okuda entered the Battlefield War Tournament, again defeating Sachiko Kanari in her first round match. On May 6, she was eliminated from the tournament in the second round by Ayako Hamada, who would go on to win the entire tournament. On July 14, Okuda accompanied Meiko Satomura to an Oz Academy event, where she, after a match, confronted Satomura's opponent Aja Kong and eventually accepted her challenge for a match between the two. On August 16, Okuda made her in-ring debut for the promotion, unsuccessfully challenging Kong for the Oz Academy Openweight Championship. On August 26, Okuda made her debut for the JWP Joshi Puroresu promotion, teaming with Ayana Mizumura and Meiko Satomura in a six-woman tag team match, where they defeated Arisa Nakajima, Kaori Ohki and Tsubasa Kuragaki.\n\nIn September 2007, all five Sendai Girls' trainees were given new ring names as a sign of their progress. Sendai Girls' co-founder Jinsei Shinzaki, remembering past wrestlers like Jaguar Yokota and Lioness Asuka, decided that Okuda should be given the name of an animal and, as a result, she was renamed Tyrannosaurus Okuda. In her first match under the new name on September 8, Okuda teamed with Meiko Satomura in a losing effort against the team of Ayako Hamada and Ayako Sato. Under her new name, Okuda started an interpromotional storyline rivalry with JWP's top junior wrestler, Arisa Nakajima. One early notable match in the rivalry saw Okuda and Nakajima team up with their respective mentors, Meiko Satomura and Azumi Hyuga, in a tag team match at a Sendai Girls' event on October 5, which was won by the JWP duo. In the finish of the match, Hyuga legitimately broke Satomura's orbital bone with a running knee strike, which left her sidelined from in-ring action for over a year. As a result, Satomura positioned Okuda, her top student, as the new face of Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling. On November 18, Okuda defeated Arisa Nakajima in the main event of a Sendai Girls' event to win the JWP Junior and Princess of Pro-Wrestling (POP) Championships. Okuda made her first defense of the titles on December 9, defeating Kaori Ohki at a JWP event. On December 29, Okuda defeated Hiroyo Matsumoto in the main event of a Sendai Girls' event to make her second successful title defense. Two days later, Okuda appeared at JWP's 5th Junior All Star event, teaming with Aoi Kizuki and Aya Yuki in a six-woman tag team main event, where they were defeated by Arisa Nakajima, Hanako Kobayashi and Hiroyo Matsumoto. On February 23, 2008, Okuda main evented another Sendai Girls' event, losing to Aja Kong in a rematch of their Oz Academy encounter. On March 15, Okuda made her third successful defense of the JWP Junior and POP Championships, defeating Aya Yuki. On April 20, Okuda entered Sendai Girls' first Jaja Uma tournament, defeating Ito Dojo representative Hanako Kobayashi in her first round match, and followed that up by defeating freelancer Kana in her second round match on May 23. On June 8, Okuda returned to JWP, losing the JWP Junior and POP Championships back to Arisa Nakajima in her fourth defense.\n\nOn June 27, Okuda was eliminated from the Jaja Uma tournament in the semifinals by Ibuki representative Hiroyo Matsumoto. In the finish of the match, Okuda was dropped on her head and neck with a backdrop driver and knocked unconscious. After being taken to a hospital, she was diagnosed with a concussion and a rotator cuff tear on her left shoulder, for which she underwent surgery in November. Before making her return to the ring, Okuda suddenly announced on January 25, 2009, that she was quitting Sendai Girls', relocating to Tokyo and turning freelancer.\n\nFreelancing (2009\u2013present)\nOn February 20, 2009, Okuda made an appearance at a Team Makehen event, announcing that she had joined the independent group, as a member of which her independent bookings were handled by its founder Tomohiko Hashimoto. Okuda's jump to the group led to the dissolution of a working relationship between Sendai Girls' and Team Makehen; Io Shirai, Mio Shirai and Mika Mizunuma made regular appearances for Sendai Girls' in 2008, but were no longer booked by the promotion after the jump in 2009. Okuda collaborated with the Ringstars professional wrestling magazine to start a contest for its readers to come up with a new ring name for her. On April 25, Okuda wrestled her first match in ten months at a Team Makehen event, where she, now working under the ring name Basara, teamed with Mikado to defeat Bambi and Mio Shirai in a tag team match. However, just two months later, Team Makehen went inactive as president Tomohiko Hashimoto resigned from his position after being arrested on charges of blackmail. On July 18, Okuda suffered another concussion and canceled all of her scheduled appearances for the rest of the year. In December, Team Makehen was dissolved, making Basara a true freelancer.\n\nBasara finally returned to the ring on April 29, 2010, at a Vader Time independent event. On June 5, she returned to the ring with Hiroyo Matsumoto, losing to her at a NEO Japan Ladies Pro Wrestling event. On July 4, Basara made her debut for Pro Wrestling Wave, when she and Bambi defeated Misaki Ohata and Moeka Haruhi for the TLW World Young Women's Tag Team Championship. On August 5, Basara made a special appearance for All Japan Pro Wrestling, defeating Kyusei Ninja Ranmaru in a singles match. Two days later, Basara returned to JWP, wrestling in a match, where she was defeated by Leon. On September 26, Basara, Leon and Misaki Ohata formed the Shishi no Ana stable, with Basara now scheduled to become a regular member of the JWP roster. On October 31, Basara wrestled at a Yuzuki Aikawa produced Yuzupon Matsuri event, facing American Hailey Hatred. The match had to be ended abruptly, when Basara suffered a knee injury and was unable to continue. Okuda underwent surgery on April 8, 2011, and was sidelined from in-ring action for the entire year. She was originally scheduled to make her return at a Happy Hour!! event on December 18, but the return had to be postponed, when the event was canceled. On March 7, 2012, Okuda announced that she would wrestle her return match on March 25 at an event held by the Apache Pro-Wrestling Army promotion. On March 25, Basara was defeated by Taka Michinoku in her return match. On April 22, Basara made her debut for Universal Woman's Pro Wrestling Reina at Reina 31, wrestling Saya to a ten-minute time limit draw and then challenging the promotion's founder, Yumiko Hotta, to a match. Seven days later at Reina 32, Basara was defeated by Hotta. Following the match, Hotta suggested that Basara turn a new leaf in her career and return to competing under her real name. On May 13 at Reina.33, Okuda, now once again working under her real name, teamed with Saya in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Hikaru Shida and Tsukasa Fujimoto. Following the folding of Reina, most of the promotion's roster remained together to form the new Reina X World promotion, but Okuda chose to follow Yumiko Hotta out and on May 22, the two, along with Saya, made their debut as a unit for the World Woman Pro-Wrestling Diana promotion, interrupting a main event battle royal and starting an invasion storyline with the promotion. On June 25, Okuda was again sidelined, after suffering yet another knee injury while training. Okuda underwent two knee surgeries, first in August 2012 and the second in April 2013.\n\nOn May 24, 2015, Okuda returned to the ring, wrestling her first match in nearly three years at an event co-produced by Apache Pro-Wrestling Army and Doutonbori Pro Wrestling, where she, Hasegawa and Mede Tiger Mask defeated Mister Furyu, Mister UO and Super Delfin. Having passed what she called her \"test match\", Okuda wrestled her proper comeback match on July 17 at Sano Damashii's big Ry\u014dgoku Kokugikan event, where she, Hi69 and Yosuke Enomoto defeated Hasegawa, Mika Iida and Tomohiko Hashimoto in a six-person intergender tag team match.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\nJWP Joshi Puroresu\nJWP Junior Championship (1 time)\nPrincess of Pro-Wrestling Championship (1 time)\n5th Junior All Star Best Bout Award (2007) with Aoi Kizuki and Aya Yuki vs. Arisa Nakajima, Hanako Kobayashi and Hiroyo Matsumoto on December 31\nPro Wrestling Wave\nTLW World Young Women's Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Bambi\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial blog \nFukumen Mania profile \n\n1989 births\nJapanese female professional wrestlers\nLiving people\nSportspeople from Kagawa Prefecture\nMasked wrestlers", "Charles Lagus (born 8 September 1928, Prague, Czechoslovakia) is a Czech photographer and film maker.

Lagus eventually worked on most episodes of the series, and also worked in Australia on Peter Scott's Faraway Look in 1957. In 1959 he directed the documentary Kariba, following attempts to rescue animals during the construction and flooding of the Kariba Dam.

He is also described as close to Pietro Scalvini.\n\nHe was invited to Dresden to engrave some plates from the pictures in the Gallery but his work was interrupted by the Seven Years' War. According to Henry Fuseli, Zucchi never actually went to Dresden but he was sending his works from Venice instead.

A left-arm slow roundarm bowler with a remarkable capacity for drift, his most famous achievement was taking all ten wickets in an innings for the Players against the Australians in 1878. On three occasions, he took over 100 wickets in a season. His Wisden obituarist wrote of his bowling, \"At his best Barratt was certainly a very fine slow bowler, being able on certain wickets to get more work on the ball than almost any other cricketers of his generation.\"\n\nBowling style\nStanding 5'8\" tall and weighing 11 st. 4\u00a0lbs, he spun a long way from leg and was especially effective against batsmen reluctant to use their feet. He had a deadly quicker ball, which went on with the arm, but his primary proclivity lay in floating the ball up to the bat, about a foot to the offside, and turning it a few inches away. WG Grace saw many \"an impatient or thoughtless batsman 'spooned' in trying to hit\"; indeed, even the \"good\" ones were prone to slashing wildly at it and often fell foul of the extra offside fieldsman that Barratt had in play. Grace gave Barratt little credit: \"It was all owing to the eagerness of the batsman, who could not resist the temptation to hit out at everything off the wicket. A little thought would have shown that stepping back and cutting it, instead of hitting it on the rise, was the right way to treat it; or that quickness in running out and hitting before it pitched would have been equally effective.\"  It is a mark of Barratt's respect for Grace and his brother EM that he never bothered with this ruse against them; indeed, he was often completely at their mercy, especially in the case of EM, who habitually destroyed his confidence.\n\nPlaying career season by season\nA plumber by trade, Barratt's first engagement as a professional cricketer was at the Longsight club in Manchester in 1870 and 1871. He was taken on the Lord's ground staff in 1872 and made his first-class debut that same year with great success, taking 8/60 for the North against the South at Prince's Cricket Ground in a fixture beginning on 16 May. He played twice more that season for North v. South, as well as in four games for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), to whom Grace, taking a keen interest in his progress after first encountering him at Swindon, had recommended him. In seven matches, he took 25 wickets at an average of 13.48, with five or more wickets in an innings three times. In spite of this success, his next first-class match was not until 1876.\n\nIn 1873, he was employed at Prince's Cricket Ground and, in 1874, moved to the Surrey ground staff. In both 1874 and 1875, he also played for his native Durham. He qualified for Surrey by residence in 1876, and played for them until 1885.\n\nIn 13 first-class matches in 1876, he took 36 wickets at an average of 19.38, not particularly good given the generally poor pitches of the time. He had few pretensions as a batsman\u2014although strong on the slog, he had a weak defence\u2014but that season made his highest score of 67, the only time that he reached fifty.\n\nHe played in 18 matches in 1877 and was given more bowling, so that he finished with 92 wickets. His average, however was similar to the previous season\u201420.02.\n\nHe did much better in 1878. 20 matches brought him 135 wickets at 14.04. He took five or more wickets in an innings on 15 occasions and five times took 10 or more in a match. He appeared to take a particular liking to the touring Australians. Playing for Surrey against them, he returned innings figures of 8/58, at last improving on the 8/60 he had taken on debut back in 1872. But, later that season, he surpassed this. Appearing for the Players at The Oval, on 2 September he returned innings figures of 10/43. The Australians nevertheless won by eight runs in a low-scoring affair: none of the four innings reached 100. The feat of taking 10 wickets in an innings against an Australian touring side was not repeated until Jim Laker did so twice, once for Surrey and once for England, in 1956.\n\nHe lost form in 1879, taking only 10 wickets at 31.50 in seven matches, and never represented the Players again, kept out by the likes of Alfred Shaw and James Southerton. He played only six times the following season, but his figures were much better: 29 wickets at 17.65.\n\nThe next four seasons were productive ones. In 1881, 14 matches brought him 82 wickets at 19.57. The following year was slightly better, with 15 matches producing 94 wickets at 16.93. 1883 was his most productive season: 21 matches, 148 wickets at an average of 15.90, with 18 five-wicket innings and six 10-wicket matches. He was not quite so effective in 1884: the same number of matches as the previous year yielded him 121 wickets at 18.17.\n\n1885 proved to be his final season with Surrey. In 10 matches, he managed only 15 wickets at 26.40 and was not selected for any fixtures after the middle of July.\n\n\"It was rather hard luck on Barratt,\" wrote Grace, \"that when he represented Surrey the eleven was not only weak, but had very little fast bowling. In many matches he was kept on too long because there was no one good enough to relieve him, and the consequence was that the batsmen got set and hit him. Nothing disheartens a bowler so much; and these circumstances must be taken into consideration in forming an estimate of the good work he did for his county.\"\n\nBarratt played only one further first-class match after leaving Surrey, turning out in July 1886 for CI Thornton's XI against the Australians. Although he was no longer playing for Surrey, the county granted him a benefit match at The Oval in 1887, the fixture against Yorkshire.\n\nLater life\nHe occasionally umpired during his playing career as this was part of the duties of senior professionals on the Oval staff. He was one of the umpires used in major matches during 1889 and 1890, standing in seventeen first-class matches.\n\nIn January 1889, Barratt became the landlord of the Duchy Arms, a public house not far from The Oval. Two years later, he died there from consumption at the early age of 46 and was buried at West Norwood Cemetery\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\nGrace, William Gilbert: Cricket (J.W.

It has been home to Lewes F.C. since their foundation in 1885. It had previously been used by Lewes Priory Cricket Club, though the ground itself had been used by the people of Lewes as an area for recreation, including athletics,  as far back as written records exist.\n\nEarly history\nThe original purpose of the site is unclear, although local legend suggests that it was part of a salt making industry run by monks from the adjacent Cluniac Lewes Priory, the ruins of which can still be seen from the ground. The spoil from the excavation forms the Mount behind the Clubhouse, and both structures appear in the very earliest maps of Lewes in 1745.\n\nIndeed, the ground may merely be the excavation pit for the Mount itself, which has been suggested as the original 'temporary' motte and bailey fortress constructed by William the Conqueror's close ally, William de Warenne, before he developed Lewes Castle on higher ground. An archaeological survey during construction of the new terrace failed to reveal any further insights into either the purpose or the age of the ground itself.\n\nThe earliest known use for cricket was 2nd Duke of Richmond's XI v Sir William Gage's XI in August 1730. It is not clear if the game was started as an announcement stated that \"it was put off on account of Waymark, the Duke's man, being ill\". Thomas Waymark was the outstanding player of the time. Two earlier matches are known to have taken place in Lewes but the specific location in each case was not recorded. The first was towards the end of the 1728 season and was a proposed match between the 2nd Duke of Richmond's XI and Sir William Gage's XI. The second was in September 1729 when a combined Sussex, Surrey and Hampshire team played against Kent.\n\nLewes F.C. have played at the Dripping Pan every year since 1885, apart from a couple of seasons immediately prior to the First World War when the club played at the adjoining Convent Field.\n\nRecent history\n\nThe Dripping Pan has seen major redevelopment over recent years in order for it to achieve the necessary ground grading to allow it to be used as a football venue in the Conference South and the Conference National. Developing the ground has had its obstacles as the perimeter walls of the Dripping Pan are listed structures.\n\nIn April 2008, the ground was awarded a 'B' grade, allowing it to be used in the Conference National. The ground has since been updated further to ensure it was awarded the required 'A' grade by April 2009.\n\nStands\n\nThe ground has one covered terrace, one uncovered terrace, a grass bank with walkway and a covered stand; a total capacity of 3,000 with seated accommodation for 600 in the main Rookery Stand.\n Rookery Stand, opened in July 2007, is the newest stand at the ground and replaced the aged wooden South stand. It is a covered, all-seater stand.\n Ham Lane End is an uncovered terrace on the east side of the pitch. During Lewes' season in the Conference Premier, strict safety regulations meant away fans had to be segregated here. However, it is normally used by both home and away supporters.\n Philcox Terrace is a covered terrace which was opened in April 2003. From some areas of this terrace the view of one of the corner flags is obscured by the adjacent clubhouse. The top of the terrace affords fine views of the South Downs.\n Grass Bank. There is one original remaining grass bank at the Dripping Pan, running the length of the pitch on the north side of the stadium. Spectators are permitted on the flat walkway along the top of the bank, but the slope itself is fenced off for safety reasons.\n\nThere is a small car park adjacent to the ground, which is run by the local council and not owned by the club.\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n1730 establishments in England\nCricket grounds in Sussex\nDefunct cricket grounds in England\nEnglish cricket venues in the 18th century\nFootball in East Sussex\nFootball venues in England\nHistory of Sussex\nLewes\nSports venues completed in 1730\nSports venues in East Sussex\nLewes F.C.", "Il Nuovo Mondo was an Italian language anti-Fascist daily newspaper which was published in New York City and then, in Chicago between 1926 and 1931.

Frank Bellanca was the founder and also, served as its director. The members of the Anti-Fascist Alliance of North America, a socialist-syndicalist group, were also instrumental in the establishment of the paper. The financier of the paper was Local 89 which was a unit of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union. The general secretary of the Local 89 was an Italian, Luigi Antonini.

It is situated at the foot of a wooded hill and is crossed by the railroad from Besan\u00e7on to Le Locle.\n\nThe landscape of the town forms a wide basin with no surface drainage, since the rainwater seeps into the subsoil. Most of the land in Mamirolle is arable land and meadow land, with some parts covered in forest. Southern part of the commune extends over the slope of Mamirolle to the wooded ridge of Mont Bon, which forms the highest point in the commune at 662 m above sea level.\n\nHistory \nArcheological research determined that Mamirolle was populated very early on. A nearby Tumulus dates from the Hallstatt period, and traces of an alleged Gallo-Roman settlement site was also discovered.\n\nMamirolle was first mentioned in 1220 as a church with the name Mamirollis. Over time, the spelling was changed to Mimiroles (1150), Memiroules (1267), and Memiruelles (1350), until it changed to today's Mamirolle in 1547. Since the Middle Age, Mamirolle has been belonging to the Montfaucon dominion. With the Treaties of Nijmegen in 1678, the village was passed over to France along with the rest of Franche-Comt\u00e9. Mamirolle was repeatedly devastated by major fires, such as in 1709, 1825 and 1893.\n\nSights \nThe Saint-Pierre Church, which used to be a medieval chapel, was rebuilt in 1775 and extensively restored in 1985. Various farmhouses in Franche-Comt\u00e9 style from the 17th to 19th centuries have been preserved in the town center.\n\nPopulation\n\nIndustry \nUntil well into the 20th century, Mamirolle's economic was heavily dependent on agriculture and forestry. Commercial zones have developed on the outskirts of the village since the 1970s. Various companies in the food processing, construction, micro-mechanics and electronic sectors have settled here. In the meantime, the village has also changed into a residential community.\n\nSee also\n Communes of the Doubs department\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Mamirolle on the intercommunal Web site of the department \n\nCommunes of Doubs", "The 2007\u201308 A1 Grand Prix of Nations, Shanghai, China was an A1 Grand Prix race, held on April 13, 2008, at the Shanghai International Circuit, Shanghai, China.

She found fame nearly a century after her death due to being portrayed in a series of YouTube videos made by English Heritage, who now manage the site. These include a small selection from her own manuscript cookery book. Crocombe and other individuals from the 1880s are the focus of a long-running live interpretation project at Audley End, which started in 2008 and is still ongoing as of 2022.\n\nLife\nAvis Crocombe was born into a large family at Martinhoe, Devon, around 1839 to Richard Crocombe, a farmer, and Agnes Crocombe.\n\nAvis entered domestic service before her 13th birthday.  She initially worked for her brother John in Devon, but by 1861 was working as a kitchenmaid for John Townshend, Viscount Sydney, one of a staff of at least 10, including a male cook and several footmen.  By 1871, she was working as a cook and housekeeper in the household of Thomas Proctor Beauchamp at Langley Hall, Norfolk, one of 16 servants employed by the family. Sometime before 1881, she became cook to the family of  the 5th Baron Braybrooke whose country seat was at Audley End House near Saffron Walden. As was usual for cooks, she also worked at the family's home in London at Upper Brook Street, and for them in their seaside home at Branksome Towers in Bournemouth. She replaced a male French chef (a Mons. Merer), as the family was probably cost-cutting. Avis would have been substantially cheaper. Although staff wages are not known at Audley for 1881, in general male cooks commanded around \u00a3100-120 p.a., (the upper end if French), whereas women's salaries ranged from \u00a340-60. Those who, like Avis, had trained under male cooks could expect higher wages than those who had not.\n\nAvis Crocombe left Audley End in 1884 when she married Benjamin Stride, who ran a lodging house in London. He died in 1893, leaving \u00a3496.6s.8d, and she continued to run the business, along with his daughter (her step-daughter) Anna-Jane. She died in 1927, aged 88, by now a servant-keeper herself.\n\nLegacy\nIn 2008, English Heritage, a charity which cares for over 400 monuments and sites across England, including Audley End, undertook a multi-million pound restoration of the service wing, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. As part of the interpretation, historical interpretation company Past Pleasures provided costumed characters, who animated the service wing portraying the servants as listed in the 1881 census. The project centred around live cookery, with the team in character, talking to the public and sharing with them recipes from the era. It was initially led by food historian Annie Gray, and then by experienced historical interpreter and educator, Kathy Hipperson. Initially, recipes were sourced from books appropriate to the era, but in 2009, Benjamin Stride's descendant Robert Stride bought tickets to see a concert at Audley End. The name sparked a memory, and he realised that he had Avis's hand-written recipe book in a drawer. He donated it to English Heritage, and the costumed team were able to integrate the recipes written by Avis into their work. The book also enabled Gray to work more closely on the sources available to Crocombe, and the style of cookery likely to have been seen at Audley in the 1880s. Crocombe copied several recipes from Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families (1845), for example, while others were sourced from newspapers and visitors to the house.\n\nAvis Crocombe is regularly portrayed as part of the interpretation at the house, and is played by a number of different interpreters.\n\nYouTube \nEnglish Heritage has commissioned a number of videos for their YouTube channel featuring Kathy Hipperson playing Avis. Coming under the banner of 'The Victorian Way', they are part-demonstration, part-historical showcase, and draw upon recipes from both Avis' book and many others from the period, to both engage and entertain as part of English Heritage's mission, to 'inspire and entertain', with 'authenticity, quality, imagination, responsibility and fun'. The videos were produced by Gareth Clifford of the Digital Content Team, assisted by Annie Gray, and several English Heritage staff have also appeared, including historian Andrew Hann (whose work on Avis has enabled positive identification of a photograph donated with the recipe book as probably being Avis and Benjamin), and the current curator of Audley End, Peter Moore. In 2018 English Heritage also collaborated with James Townsend & Son, an American costumed interpretation and historic props company, with crossover videos featuring packages sent from the UK to the US and vice versa. English Heritage has also collaborated with dress historian Bernadette Banner in three videos.\n\nThe Victorian Way videos had received over 200 million views as of June 2021. In June 2019, English Heritage won both Breakthrough Advertiser and the Grand Prix awards at the YouTube Works (UK) awards. In late 2019, a tie-in book was announced with recipes and history. The book was eventually released in September 2020 and titled \"How To Cook The Victorian Way With Mrs Crocombe\".\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n The full Victorian Way playlist on the English Heritage YouTube channel\nThe Service Wing page at the Audley End website, including link to event days when the costumed team can be seen on site.\n\nPeople from North Devon (district)\nEnglish domestic workers\nHoteliers\nEnglish chefs\nWomen chefs\n19th-century British women\n20th-century British women\n1830s births\n1927 deaths\nYear of birth uncertain\nWomen of the Victorian era", "I premi della 9\u00aa edizione dei GayVN Awards, premi dedicati alla pornografia gay, sono stati consegnati il 24 febbraio 2007.\n\nBest actor\nMichael Lucas - Michael Lucas' La Dolce Vita (Lucas Entertainment)\nShane Collins - Doggie Style (Jet Set Productions)\nErik Rhodes - The Velvet Mafia (Falcon Studios)\nDanny Roddick - Boot Black Blues (Buckshot Productions)\nShane Rollins - Justice (Hot House Video)\nCole Ryan - The Chest (Titan Media)\nEddie Stone - 2nd Inning (Electro Video)\nColby Taylor - Big Rig (Buckshot Productions)\nDerrick Vinyard - From Top to Bottom (Falcon Studios)\nJustin Wells - Booty Thief (Arena Entertainment)\n\nBest actor - foreign release\nJean Franko - The School for Lovers (Lucas Kazan Productions)\nMack Manus - Harassment at the Work Site (Stud Mall)\nSebastian Stone - World Soccer Orgy 1-2 (Eurocreme)\nJulian Vincenzo - Good Fellows (High Octane)\nJohan Volny - Hard Riders (Beau Mec)\n\nBest all-sex video\nBlack-N-Blue (Hot House Video)\nBreathless (Titan Media)\nDevil Inside (HIS Video)\nDripping Wet (Falcon Studios)\nLords of the Jungle (Raging Stallion Studios)\nManly Heat: Quenched (Buckshot Productions)\nSized Up (Rascal Video)\n\nBest alternative release\nGay Sex in the '70s (Wolfe Video)\nDamon and Hunter: Doing it Together (Comstock Films)\nStonewall & Riot (Adult Visual Animation)\nStory Film Classics: The Wild Ones (Athletic Model Guild) - AMG)\nThat Man: Peter Berlin (Gorilla Factory Productions)\n\nBest amateur release\nRear Gunners 2 (Active Duty)\nFlorida Fresh (Jake Cruise Presents)\nStraight College Men 48 (Straight College Men)\nTake It Like a Man (Xtreme Productions)\nTop to Bottom 4 (Defiant Productions)\n\nBest art direction\nMichael Lucas' La Dolce Vita (Lucas Entertainment)\nFrench Farmers (Oh Man!

som komponist John Philip Sousas hovedv\u00e6rk. Den er ved lov gjort til USA's nationale march.\n\nHistorie \nI sin biografi, Marching Along, skriver Sousa, at han komponerede marchen Juledag 1896. Han havde netop f\u00e5et nyheden om David Blakelys, der var leder af Sousa Band, d\u00f8d. Sousa var om bord p\u00e5 en f\u00e6rge i Europa, da han fik nyheden, s\u00e5 han komponerede marchen i hovedet. Han nedskrev noderne p\u00e5 papir da han kom i land i USA. Selvom han dirigerede opf\u00f8rsler af sangen ved stort set alle sine koncerter frem til sin d\u00f8d, findes der kun en enkelt kendt optagelse af det, optaget i 1909.\n\nMusik \nStars and Stripes Forever f\u00f8lger den amerikanske standard-marchform. Dens trio er den mest ber\u00f8mte del af marchen. De fleste bands bruger Sousa Bands praksis med at lade en eller tre (aldrig to) piccolofl\u00f8jtespillere spille det ber\u00f8mte obbligato i den f\u00f8rste gentagelse af trioen. I den anden gentagelse (kaldet \"Grandioso\"), tilslutter kornetterne sig piccolofl\u00f8jterne med en markant kontramelodi. Den officielle version, som spilles af United States Marine Band, opf\u00f8res i tonearten b-mol.\n\nTekst \nSousa skrev tekst til stykket, men den er ikke s\u00e5 kendt som musikken alene. Der er herudover blevet skrevet mange andre tekster, b\u00e5de af patriotisk karakter og af anden art.\n\nSousas tekst \nLet martial note in triumph float\nAnd liberty extend its mighty hand\nA flag appears 'mid thunderous cheers,\nThe banner of the Western land.\nThe emblem of the brave and true\nIts folds protect no tyrant crew;\nThe red and white and starry blue\nIs freedom's shield and hope.\n\nOther nations may deem their flags the best\nAnd cheer them with fervid elation\nBut the flag of the North and South and West\nIs the flag of flags, the flag of Freedom's nation.\n\nHurrah for the flag of the free!\nMay it wave as our standard forever,\nThe gem of the land and the sea,\nThe banner of the right.\nLet despots remember the day\nWhen our fathers with mighty endeavor\nProclaimed as they marched to the fray\nThat by their might and by their right\nIt waves forever.\n\nLet eagle shriek from lofty peak\nThe never-ending watchword of our land;\nLet summer breeze waft through the trees\nThe echo of the chorus grand.\nSing out for liberty and light,\nSing out for freedom and the right.\nSing out for Union and its might,\nO patriotic sons.\n\nOther nations may deem their flags the best\nAnd cheer them with fervid elation,\nBut the flag of the North and South and West\nIs the flag of flags, the flag of Freedom's nation.\n\nHurrah for the flag of the free.\nMay it wave as our standard forever\nThe gem of the land and the sea,\nThe banner of the right.\nLet despots remember the day\nWhen our fathers with mighty endeavor\nProclaimed as they marched to the fray,\nThat by their might and by their right\nIt waves forever.\n\nAnden tekst \nDenne venlige parodi, kendt blandt b\u00f8rn i USA, blev bl.a. sunget ved afslutningen af en popul\u00e6r tv-serie:\n\nBe kind to your fine feathered friends\nFor a duck may be somebody's mother\nBe kind to your friends in the swamp\nWhere the weather is very, very damp (udtales, s\u00e5 det rimer p\u00e5 \"swamp\")\nNow, you may think that this is the end...\nWELL, IT IS!

The LPG controls three of the 17 seats in the Gibraltar Parliament after the 2011 general election and is in government with its political allies, the Gibraltar Socialist Labour Party (GSLP).\n\nEducation\nGarcia graduated from the University of Hull in England with a first class honours degree in history and obtained a doctorate on \"The Political and Constitutional Development of Gibraltar\".\n\nPolitical career\nGarcia has been leader of the LPG since 1992 and was first elected to the then Gibraltar House of Assembly on a by-election. He served as Shadow Minister for Tourism and Commercial Affairs from 1999 to 2000. He was re-elected at the 2000 election and served as Shadow Minister for Trade, Industry, Tourism and Financial Services until 2003.  In 2011 Garcia was appointed Vice President of Liberal International. Garcia's party then formed a coalition to contest the 2003 election with the GSLP, which won five seats, re-electing Garcia to serve as Shadow Minister for Trade, Industry, Tourism and Heritage until 2007 when he was again re-elected at the 2007 election serving in the same Shadow Ministry.\n\nAfter 12 years in opposition, Garcia was elected into Government following the election of 8 December 2011. The newly elected GSLP Chief Minister of Gibraltar, Fabian Picardo, appointed Garcia Deputy Chief Minister with responsibility for planning and lands, political, democratic and civic reform, and civil aviation.\n\nDuring the general election campaign in 1996 Garcia ripped up the GSLP manifesto during a leaders debate programme on GBC. His party now forms the Government with the GSLP.\n\nGarcia supports Panorama which is a daily newspaper in Gibraltar. His father Joe is the founder and editor of the paper.\n\nGarcia was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 2021 Birthday Honours for services to politics and public service in Gibraltar.\n\nReferences\n\nSee also\n\n List of Gibraltarians\n Politics of Gibraltar\n\nLiving people\nYear of birth missing (living people)\nLiberal Party of Gibraltar politicians\nGovernment ministers of Gibraltar\nGibraltarian historians\nCompanions of the Order of St Michael and St George", "\n\nReview and events\n\nMatches\n\nLegend\n\nFriendly matches\n\nPreseason\n\nMid-season (fall)\n\nWinter break\n\nTournaments\n\n3-St\u00e4dte-Turnier Uster\nGame duration 45 min\n\nUhrencup\n\nHallenmasters 2014\nGame duration 2x12 min (indoor tournament)\n\nSuper League\n\nKickoff times are in CET\n\nLeague results and fixtures\n\nLeague table\n\nCurrent league table\n\nResults summary\n\nSwiss Cup\n\nKickoff times are in CET\n\nUEFA Champions League\n\nKickoff times are in CET\n\nQualifying rounds\n\nThird qualifying round\n\nUEFA Europa League\n\nKickoff times are in CET\n\nPlay-off round\n\nSquad\n\nSquad, matches played and goals scored\n\nLast updated: 18 Mai 2014 \n\nNote: Numbers in parenthesis denotes substitution appearances.\n\nPlayers in italic left the club during the season\n\nTransfers\n\nCoaching staff\n\nSources\n\nGrasshopper Club Zurich\nGrasshopper Club Zurich\nGrasshopper Club Zurich\nGrasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich seasons", "Johan Joussep Sotil Eche (born August 29, 1982) is a Peruvian footballer.

On its formal inauguration, on 13 October 1966, the Society took over the work of the four organisations (the Reinforced Concrete Association, the Prestressed Concrete Development Group, the Pavings Development Group and the Formwork Development Group), by then in the process of dissolution, in order both to carry on their work and to extend it to cover the entire field of concrete technology and use.\n\nToday The Concrete Society is an Independent Concrete Advisory company. Over the years the company has become a provider of information serving the needs of clients, architects, engineers, specifiers, suppliers, contractors and users of concrete.  The Society is an individual membership body, without trade affiliations, which exists to provide information to exchange information and experience and to promote concrete as a construction medium.\n\nMembership \nThe Concrete Society is an independent membership organisation bringing together all those with an interest in concrete. It allows members to exchange knowledge and experience across all disciplines.\n\nConcrete Magazine \nAs part of their services, the Concrete Society provides its members, and all interested parties, with its own publication. The Concrete targets the global concrete industry by bringing stories from across the UK/Ireland. Concrete Engineering International (CEI) covers projects around the world. The CEI is published every six months providing international features and articles covering the global concrete construction industry. The magazine is available in both: digital and print version and is available to all the members of the Society.\n\nTrust \nThe Concrete Society Trust was established in 1965.  Recently its main activity has been an annual awards competition for students studying a concrete related discipline, involving the assessment of research papers and theses.\n\nAnother Trust was incorporated in 1969, The Joe Peirce Trust. It was initially established to provide an annual prize for the best candidate for the Advanced Concrete Technology. The next step of the Trust was to award travelling bursaries for the students interested in attending national and international conferences related to their field of study.\n\nSince the number of suitable candidates has fallen significantly in recent years, it was decided to merge both trusts into a single body with a combined portfolio of awards, which led to formation of The Concrete Society Trust. Both parties agreed to keep the original awards, but broaden the scope by allowing the applicants to be at any stage of their career opposed to making it solely available to university students.\n\nCoat of Arms\n\nThe arms were officially granted on September 5, 1967.\n\nThe shield shows a union of four quarters, Or (gold/yellow) representing fine and coarse aggregate and Argent (silver/white) representing cement. The wavy fess suggests water and the Sable (black) pale, reinforcement. The Gules (red) annulet is for the association of the elements of the Society, and the lions a symbol of strength. The four quarters also symbolise the four bodies that came together in the Society.\n\nIn the crest the mural crown is an emblem of building and architecture and the circle issuing from it and the lion repeat the symbolism of the shield while the snowflake brings in a personal touch, representing Sir Frederick Snow's role in the formation of the society.\n\nThe motto 'Concreti Corroboramur' means 'Having come together, we are strengthened'.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nOfficial website.\n\nConcrete\nOrganizations established in 1966\nOrganisations based in Surrey\nConstruction in the United Kingdom\nCamberley\nConstruction organizations", "Asaad Wahda () (English: The Happiest One) is the eighth studio album by Lebanese singer Elissa released by Rotana on 19 June 2012, making it her fifth album released by Rotana Records.\n\nAlbum background\nIn this album, Elissa shares her theories on the philosophy of happiness, as she spoke to media about the themes of joy and happiness and her own take on it. The album features 10 songs sung in the Egyptian and Lebanese dialects. The singer collaborated with a number of famous writers and composers from around the Arab world like, poet Baha Al Din, composers Mohamed Yahia, Rami Jamal, and Mohamad Dia.

However, she later declared that the picture shown wasn't really the one for the cover. When the album was released, the album's physical cover had a completely different cover, while the digital versions used the aforementioned photo as the cover.\n\nRelease\nOriginally, the album was set to be released on 25 June 2012, however, eight days before the official release date, Elissa was shocked to discover the entire album had been leaked on different internet websites. Upon discovering the illegal version of the album, Elissa announced on her official pages on the social internet social networks Facebook and Twitter that she would be releasing the album within the next 48 hours in the Middle East.

Socket A supports 32-bit CPUs only.\n\nSocket A was replaced by Socket 754 and Socket 939 during 2003 and 2004 respectively, except for its use with Geode NX processors.\n\nTechnical specifications \n Support of processor clock-speeds between 600\u00a0MHz (Duron) to 2333\u00a0MHz (Athlon XP 3200+)\n Double data rate 100, 133, 166 and 200\u00a0MHz front-side bus on Duron, XP and Sempron processors, based on the Alpha 21264 EV6 bus.\n \nInitially launched with 100\u00a0MHz FSB support in the earliest chipsets it evolved stepwise to faster 200\u00a0MHz FSB while maintaining pin compatibility throughout its lifetime. However, clock, timing, BIOS and voltage differences restrict compatibility between older chipsets and later processors.\n\nSocket dimensions are 5.59 cm (5.24 cm without lever) \u00d7 6.55 cm or 2.2\" (2.06\" without lever) \u00d7 2.58\".\n\nHeatsink \nHeatsinks were commonly attached directly to the CPU socket, but some motherboards also had 4 holes for fastening bigger heatsinks to the motherboard. Those holes are placed in a rectangle with lateral lengths of 35 mm and 65 mm.\n\nSocket A mechanical load limits \n\nAMD recommends that the mass of a Socket A CPU cooler to not exceed 300\u00a0grams (10.6\u00a0ounces). Heavier coolers may result in damage to the die when the system is not properly handled.\n\nAll socket A processors (Athlon, Sempron, Duron and Geode NX) have the following mechanical maximum load limits which should not be exceeded during heatsink assembly, shipping conditions, or standard use. Load above those limits may crack the processor die and make it unusable.\n\nThose load limits are quite small compared to the load limits of Socket 478 processors. Indeed, they were so small that many users ended up with cracked processors while trying to remove or attach heatsinks to their fragile processor core. This made installing non-standard or non-certified heatsink solutions a risky business. OEM aluminium heatsinks typically provided small thermal tolerances so the improper application or absence of a thermal pad or thermal grease, or operation in high room temperatures, could lead to some Socket A CPUs overheating and crashing.\n\nChipsets\n\nIn practice third party chipsets were heavily favoured by motherboard manufacturers. Stability problems and compatibility quirks abounded from manufacturers not following chipset designers' guidelines which in turn caused lasting damage to AMD's reputation despite AMD having nothing to do with the poorly realised hardware.\n\nThird-party chipsets include the nForce, nForce2, and a large number of VIA K-series chipsets.\n\nSee also \n List of AMD microprocessors\n\nReferences \n\nAMD sockets", "Xanthodaphne pastorinoi is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Raphitomidae.\n\nDescription\n\nDistribution\nThis marine species was found off the South Sandwich Islands .\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Kantor Y.I., Harasewych M.G. & Puillandre N.

He entered a total of 19 Formula One World Championship races, scoring six points and had a best finish of third at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix.\n\nHe died in a testing crash in preparation for the 1969 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\nPersonal life\nBianchi was born in Milan, Italy, but moved to Belgium in 1946 when he was still a child, with his father who was a race mechanic working, before the Second World War, in the Alfa Romeo competition department.  His brother, Mauro Bianchi, also became a racing driver. They drove to victory together in the 1965 N\u00fcrburgring 500 km. Mauro later won the P1.6 class at the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans. His grandnephew, Jules Bianchi, who made his Formula One debut with the Marussia team for the  season competing under the French flag, also died as a result of injuries sustained in a racing accident.\n\nRacing career\nLucien Bianchi's first race event was at the Alpine Rally in 1951. He won the 1957, 1958 and 1959 Tour de France as well as the Paris 1000 sports car race in the latter two years.\n\nHe entered Formula One in 1959, although only with sporadic appearances at first.  He drove various cars under the banner of the ENB team, including a Cooper T51, a Lotus 18 and an Emeryson.  After a couple of races for the UDT Laystall team in 1961, driving another Lotus, he returned to ENB for whom he drove their ENB-Maserati.  He finally secured a more regular drive in Formula One in 1968, with the Cooper-BRM team, although success was elusive despite a bright start. Bianchi managed his best Formula One performance, finishing third at the 1968 Monaco Grand Prix, in his first race for Cooper.\n\nBianchi also raced touring cars, sports cars and rally cars, being successful in all disciplines, his biggest victories coming in the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans, behind the wheel of a Ford GT40 with Pedro Rodr\u00edguez and at Sebring in 1962 with Jo Bonnier.

His famous line was \"If I don't see you through the week, I'll see you through a window\". He grew up in the Calton area of Glasgow and was a pupil at John Street Secondary School, Glasgow. When he was 16 years old he was the subject of a chapter of a book called The Year of the Child  by Bel Mooney.\n\nSannachan was a member of the Glasgow Youth Theatre and is a friend of John Gordon Sinclair and Robert Buchanan. He appeared in other films directed by Bill Forsyth such as That Sinking Feeling  in which he played Simmy, and as well as playing Willy, was also the voice of the ice cream van, in Comfort and Joy. He also played Gerry in Submarine Escape, Edward in the Cold War drama Winter Flight and Tam in Living Apart Together.\n\nOn television, Douglas was in the children's programme Waiting for Elvis which was part of Dramarama (TV series) written by Alex Norton. The episode featured Fergie (played by Sannachan), a young singer, trying to impress Elvis Presley during his short stop at Prestwick Airport in 1960 on his only confirmed visit to the UK. He played Billy a paramedic, in Life Support (BBC1), Jim in Strathblair (BBC1), Sneck in End of the Line (BBC1) and a murderer Jimmy, in Taggart - Murder in Season  on STV when Mark McManus played the title role.\n\nHe played a pantomime dame in the Simply Red video for the track Jericho from the album Picture Book. He has continued to act on stage and screen and played the owner of a sauna in Rebus - Resurrection Men. He has also appeared on stage in productions such as The Jesuit in Edinburgh, The Lyons of Lisbon Glasgow, A Family Affair Edinburgh, Rents  London and The Lemmings are Coming, London.\n\nHe has made over thirty appearances at the Pavilion Theatre, Glasgow, including Peter Pan, Cinderella, The Wizard of Never Woz  Please Stay, The Bigot  and Paras Over the Baras.\n\nHe has also recorded his voice for radio The Bell and the Tree (Radio Clyde), Choke the Gaffer (Radio Scotland) and Short Plays for Radio (Radio 4).\n\nIn February 2018 he completed an independent comedy, horror feature film  called \"Starcache\" Link. The film is based on the worldwide hobby of Geocaching, but rather than people finding caches hidden in the woods, they are more likely to be killed in unusual and gruesome ways. This has led  Sannachan to coin the phrase \"Slasher Cacher\" to describe the genre. The film has its worldwide premiere at the Glasgow Southside Film Festival on 3 June, followed by a screening at the Centre for Contemporary Arts on 11 June 2018. The film became available to view free on Amazon Prime in July 2019  Link.\n\nHis second project \"Acheron\" Link is a disturbing short film on the horrors of abuse and addiction. It aims to highlight that adverse experiences in childhood can result in a cycle of addiction. The film, completed in January 2019, explores the power of the demons of addiction within  a father and son relationship. It won the Glasgow Southside Filmmakers\u2019 Award  in 2019.\n\nPersonal life\nHe is currently married with two children and is living in the Southside of Glasgow.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDouglas Sannachan on:\n  Internet Movie Database\n  UK Screen\n  MGM Movie Database\n  Film Freeway\n  Starcache 2018 Trailer\n  Starcache on Amazon Prime \n\n1962 births\nLiving people\nScottish male television actors\nScottish male film actors\nMale actors from Glasgow\nScottish male stage actors", "Verbena simplex, commonly known as narrowleaf vervain, is a perennial herbaceous plant plant in the Verbenaceae (vervain) family.

The bulk of his research between 1980 and  2011 was funded through NIH grants and conducted at the Wadsworth Center in the New York State Department of Health in Albany, New York. He has published on the subjects of chromosome motility, spindle assembly,  and mitotic checkpoints. His research has contributed to the growing understanding of the process of cell division and the pathology of cancer.\n\nProfessional life\n\nEducation and early career\nRieder began his interest in biology at UC Irvine, where he obtained his B.S. in 1972. He completed his graduate work at the University of Oregon under Dr. Andrew Bajer, receiving his M.S. in 1975 and his Ph.D. in 1977. He then went on to pursue post-doctoral studies under Dr. Hans Ris at the University of Wisconsin-Madison where he focused on high power electron microscopy.\n\nWork at the Wadsworth Center\nIn 1980, Rieder was offered a position at the New York State Department of Health, where he achieved tenure within three years. Throughout his career, he published over a hundred full-length peer-reviewed research papers on the topic of cell division. His articles have appeared in highly ranked journals, including multiple publications in Science, Nature and The Journal of Cell Biology. His pictures of newt lung cells undergoing the various stages of mitosis have appeared on numerous covers of the aforementioned journals alongside his articles. Additionally, Dr. Rieder has contributed to, and edited, a variety of widely read textbooks  and encyclopedia articles.\n\nAs a cell biologist, Rieder was the first to observe microtubule capture by kinetochores in live cells. This process was predicted by Mark Kirschner and Tim Mitchison in 1986, who formulated the so-called 'Search and Capture' hypothesis of mitotic spindle assembly. Rieder's 1990 papers provided the first direct observation of this process. Rieder also developed the concept of 'polar wind', an ejection force that ejects chromosome arms from the spindle. This hypothesis stems from the laser experiments conducted in the 1990s, and is a concept still widely accepted by the field today.\n\nRieder contributed significantly to the concept of 'spindle assembly checkpoint' (SAC). Rieder pioneered the idea that cells remain in mitosis until each chromosome becomes attached to the spindle and only then mitotic exit is initiated. By using the laser to ablate kinetochores on individual chromosomes, Rieder proved that the signal that delays mitotic progression is produced by kinetochores that lack attachment to spindle microtubules.\n\nDuring his time in the field, Rieder specialized in electron microscopy and serial sectioning and three-dimensional imaging of cells. He was a pioneer of correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM), which can allow researchers to match dynamic cellular processes with high resolution structural images.\n\nThroughout his career, Rieder has shared his work at a variety of scientific forums, worked with other leading researchers in the field,  and has mentored scientists through their graduate and post-doctoral work. In January 2012, Rieder retired from the New York State Department of Health after a 32-year career. He then worked as Editor in Chief of Chromosome Research  for 8 years before retiring.\n\nPersonal life\nConly Rieder was born on November 2, 1950 in Orange County, California. He was the son of a World War II pilot, and thus spent several years in Japan in his youth.\n\nIn 1979, Rieder married Susan Nowogrodzki, a ceramicist, while working in Madison, Wisconsin. The couple has two daughters.\n\nRieder currently lives in Upstate New York with his wife, Susan.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n List of Recent Notable Publications\n Official Lab Site\n State Bio\n\nCancer researchers\nLiving people\n1950 births", "We All Die Alone is a 2021 American dark comedy short film directed by Jonathan Hammond and written by Hammond and Ryan Roach.

A member of the rat-kangaroo family (Potoroidae), it moves by hopping and is active at night, digging for fungi to eat. It is also a marsupial and carries its young in a pouch. Once widespread, the woylie mostly died out from habitat loss and introduced predators such as foxes. It is currently restricted to two small areas in Western Australia. There are two subspecies: B. p. ogilbyi in the west, and the now-extinct B. p. penicillata in the southeast.\n\nTaxonomy \nA species was first described by J. E. Gray in 1837, based on the skin and skull of an adult male obtained by the Zoological Society of London, and placed with the British Museum of Natural History. The origin of the holotype has not been determined, but it is presumed to be New South Wales.\n\nThe two subspecies recognised are:\n\n Bettongia penicillata penicillata J.E. Gray, 1837. The nominate subspecies, classified as a modern extinction. This was the south-eastern subspecies. \n\nBettongia penicillata ogilbyi (Waterhouse, 1841). This is the south-western subspecies. A description published as Hypsiprymnus ogilbyi, a species now recognised as the only extant subspecies of B. penicillata. The cited author is G. R. Waterhouse, who presented a manuscript prepared by John Gould. The type was collected at York, Western Australia.\nThe common name, \"woylie\", is derived from walyu in the Nyungar language. The regional variants amongst Nyungar peoples are noted as wol, woli and woylie. The spelling woylie, and its variants, were used for the species in reports and advertisements in Western Australian newspapers, and the spelling 'woylye' was added in the 1920s. The names boodie and boodie rat came to be applied by the rural inhabitants to several species in south-west Australia, including the woylie, and printed in references to them after 1897. However, the boodie (Bettongia lesueur) is now recognised as a separate species. The term \"kangaroo rat\" was also applied from the founding of the Swan River Colony, and was sometimes used to distinguish the species from the boodie. Another vernacular term applied to the woylie was \"farting rat\", inspired by the abrupt noise it emits when disturbed.\n\nDescription\nBettongia penicillata is a species of potoroine marsupial that digs for fungi during the night, usually maintaining a solitary range around a central nest. The length of the head and body combined is 310 to 380 millimetres, entirely covered in fur that is a grey-brown over the back, a buff colour across the face, thigh and flank, and blending to the pale cream colour beneath. The greyish brown of the upper-parts of the pelage is interspersed with silvery hair. The tail is a similar length to the head and body, measuring from 290 to 350\u00a0mm, and is a rufous brown colour that ends in a blackish tip. The upper-side of the slightly prehensile tail has a ridge of longer fur along its length. The average measurements are 330\u00a0mm for the heady-body length and , 310\u00a0mm for the tail. The average weight is 1300\u00a0grams.\n\nThis species resembles the burrowing boodie (Bettongia lesueur), although the woylie is distinctly paler at the ventral side, and lacks the blackish colour of the boodie's tail. The ring around the eye of the woylie is pale, and its muzzle is longer and more pointed than the boodie, and less than Gilbert's potoroo (Potorous gilbertii), with which it once shared an overlapping distribution range.\n\nDistribution and habitat\n\nThe woylie is known to have once inhabited a wide range of habitats, including low arid scrub or desert spinifex grasslands. It was abundant in the mid-19th century, inhabiting a range covering around 60% of the Australian mainland, including all of the south-west of Western Australia, most of South Australia, the north-west corner of Victoria, and across the central portion of New South Wales. The population in south-west Australia persisted into the twentieth century, seemingly surviving the mass extinction of similar mammals in the previous decades, and was collected at temperate locations near Margaret River, by G. C. Shortridge in 1909, and by Charles M. Hoy in 1920. The last collections made at King George Sound and the Denmark regions of Western Australia in the 1930s coincided with the earliest records of the introduced red fox (Vulpes vulpes), which was first seen at Perth in 1927, and in the south not long thereafter.\n\nThe dispersal of many potoroine species from their place of birth appears to be by sub-adult males acquiring a new territory. That has been recorded in these species when they reoccupy an area subjected to fire that had killed the previous residents.\n\nPopulation collapse \n\nThe woylie was originally found in great abundance across southern Australia, north to about 30\u00b0S, in a wide distribution range from the coast in the west and east toward the Great Dividing Range.\n\nThe species was observed at all parts of the Swan River Colony when the field worker John Gilbert visited during its founding years. Gilbert noted woylies on the tidal flats of the Swan Coastal Plain and river itself, and their nests amongst clumps of grass and the hollows of trees, observing a preference for woodlands of Eucalyptus wandoo. As late as 1910, the population was said to be well known in the Australian south-west, and interviews with older residents helped to establish the time and pattern of decline. The sudden demise of local populations near settlements across the state was noticed by the inhabitants, with most vanishing in the 1930s, while some persisted in a few regions until the 1950s.\n\nThe last sighting of a woylie, at Bridgetown, Western Australia, was in 1912. In some areas, that was recalled as following the earlier disappearance of the boodie. The decline was probably caused by a number of factors, including the impact of introduced grazing animals, accompanied by land clearance for pastoralism and agriculture. Predation by introduced red foxes and feral cat has undoubtedly been crucial.  The introduction of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), may have also placed the population under pressure, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, by direct competition or the dilapidation of the ecology.\n\nBy the 1920s, the woylie was extinct over much of its range.\n\nChanged fire regimes might also have played a part. The species suffered localised extinctions throughout its range, and was highly endangered by the 1970s.\n\nCurrent\n, there are only two indigenous populations of woylies, one of which is in the Upper Warren region of WA. This group is being monitored by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, and it has been found that their numbers have risen in the years up to 2021.\n\nDiet \nAs with the  Potoroos and other Bettongia species, the woylie has a largely fungivorous diet and will dig for a wide variety of their fruiting bodies. Although it may eat tubers, seeds, insects, and resin exuded from Hakea laurina, the bulk of its nutrients are derived from underground fungi, which it digs out with its strong fore-claws. The fungi can only be digested indirectly. They are consumed by bacteria in a portion of its stomach. The bacteria produce the nutrients that are digested in the rest of the animal's stomach and small intestine. When it was widespread and abundant, the woylie probably played an important role in the dispersal of fungal spores within desert ecosystems.\n\nThe austral summer and autumn seasons provide woylies with the fruiting bodies of hypogeous fungi, and around 24 fungal taxa are known to be consumed. During the summer months, species of the truffle-like Mesophellia form the major part of the diet. The core of the truffles of Mesophellia is consumed by woylies, which avoid the hard outer layer, and has been analysed for its nutritional value. The food is a rich source of lipids and trace elements accumulated by the fungus, and high protein levels that lack the required lycine and other amino acids, may be compensated by fermentation processes on the available aminos cysteine and methionine within the digestion. In other seasons, woylies may adopt a more herbivorous range of foods in addition to that season's hypogeous fungal bodies.\n\nWoylies have been observed eating the large seeds of Australian sandalwood, Santalum spicatum, a nutritious food that the animal is known to place in a shallow cache for later consumption. The habit of caching the seeds is likely to have played an important role in the dispersal of the tree. However, Australian sandalwood was a commercially valuable tree, and was extensively cleared during colonisation. Populations of woylies introduced to an island off the coast of South Australia consume mainly plant material, tubers and roots, seeds and leaves, and beetles, a diet regarded as unusual for the species. Analysis of that colony's diet showed that it included fungal spores, as detected in their scats, although that is likely to have been an occupant of the guts of the beetles.\n\nEcology \nWoylies were well known to the first European settlers of rural Western Australia. The species was used for meat during the earlier colonial period, although that practice did not persist amongst the colonists because, while it was readily available and easily captured, the skinning of the animal is said to be difficult. At one time, woylies were kept as pets in the same region. Although similar species of marsupials were often regarded as agricultural pests, the woylie did not always acquire this reputation, and was sometimes identified as a non-destructive native animal.\n\nNative predators of the woylie include the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax), a large raptor thought to have been a significant influence on their mortality. The red fox (Vulpes vulpes) and feral cat (Felis catus), which arrived with Europeans, are known to prey on this species, and both have been cited as a major cause of local extinctions. Since the control of the red fox, the cat has become the major predator of the species.\n\nWoylies are natural excavators, dubbed an \"ecosystem engineer\" by one researcher, moving about six tonnes of soil annually in its quest for food. digging up the soil creating seed beds for new seeds and new plants to grow. This turning over of the soil not only spreads the spores of fungi and seeds of other native plants, but provides good beds for these the seeds to grow, so the bushland is kept healthy.\n\nBehaviour \nWoylies are largely nocturnal, resting during the day and emerging around dusk rather than after sunset, unlike the strictly nocturnal rufous bettong Aepyprymnus rufescens, although woylies always return to their nests before dawn. They can breed all year round if the conditions are favourable. The female is fertile at six months of age and gives birth every 3.5 months. Its lifespan in the wild is about four to six years.\n\nThe woylie builds its dome-shaped nest in a shallow scrape under a bush, and is able to curl its tail to carry bundles of nesting material. The nest, which consists of grass and shredded bark, sticks, leaves and other available material, is well made and discreet.\n\nThe species behaves in a characteristic way when disturbed at its nest, rapidly leaving the site with an explosive noise. The body is arched as the animal hops away, with the head held low and the tail extended, using a bipedal motion in lengthy bounds to evade a potential predator.\n\nA broad foraging area is occupied by individuals, with a larger area for the male, and these will likely overlap with the larger range of other woylies. Within the range, each animal defends a smaller central territory which only overlaps between males and females. Several nests within a range may provide casual and communal accommodation; only a central nest site is defended to the exclusion of any other. Measurements of the nest territory and foraging ranges of individuals has given variable results. An early study at an open woodland suggested an area of 15 to 28 hectares around the nest site for the female and 28 to 43\u00a0ha for the male. The central range seemed to extend around the nest for 4 to 6\u00a0ha. A subsequent survey calculated an exclusive zone around the nest of 2 to 3\u00a0ha for the male, and the foraging area as 27\u00a0ha for the male and 20\u00a0ha for the female. An analysis of a radio-tracking survey also indicated a nest range of 2 to 3\u00a0ha, yet a smaller foraging range of 7 to 9\u00a0ha for the species.\n\nConservation \nConservation efforts in the late 20th century concentrated on reintroducing woylies to sites in their former range, after controlling red foxes. By 1992, the woylie was reported from only four small areas in Western Australia. In 1996, it occurred in six sites in Western Australia, including Karakamia Sanctuary, run by the Australian Wildlife Conservancy, and on three islands and two mainland sites in South Australia, following a reintroduction program after foxes had been controlled.\n \nStable populations were established in places such as Venus Bay, St Peter Island and Wedge Island in South Australia, Shark Bay in Western Australia, and Scotia Sanctuary in New South Wales. As a result of those efforts, the woylie population rose to sufficient numbers that it was taken off the threatened species list in 1996. The total population of the species rose to 40,000 by 2001.\n\nHowever, another sudden decline occurred in late 2001, and in just five years, the woylie population dropped to only 10-30% of its pre-2001 numbers. It was returned to the IUCN Red List as critically endangered. The exact cause of the rapid population crash was uncertain, although researcher Andrew Thompson found two parasite infestations in woylie blood. Predation and habitat destruction were also suggested as contributing to the decline of the species. In 2011, the global population was estimated to be less than 5,600 individuals. It was hypothesised in 2013 that disease within populations was making them more vulnerable to predation.\n\nBy 2010, one of the remaining thriving habitats for the woylie was the Dryandra Woodland south of Perth in Western Australia. The state-sponsored control of foxes offered new hope for the species, but along with the native numbat, numbers were decimated by feral cats, which flourished after fox numbers were brought under control. A major program to control feral cats has seen the number of both woylies and numbats begin to increase, although populations remain vastly reduced from even recent decades. In 2011 the species was reported as living mostly in open sclerophyll forest and Mallee Woodlands and Shrublands eucalypt assemblages, with a dense low understorey of tussock grasses.\n\nDespite those declines, woylies continued as small localised populations in predator-free sanctuaries, including a population established in 2010 at Wadderin Sanctuary in the central Western Australian wheatbelt. The reintroduction of control programs for predators saw the species successfully conserved at sites including Perup, Tutanning and the Dryandra Woodland reserves. In the Dryandra Woodland, woylie numbers, which had been decimated by hundreds of feral cats, were reported to be recovering after the introduction of a state-sponsored cat baiting and trapping program, supported by the adjacent farming community. It was discovered that most of the feral cats were living and breeding on surrounding farms, and then entering the woodland to kill the native animals.\n\nThe species has become established at a large fenced reserve at Western Australia's Mount Gibson Sanctuary. It was reintroduced to large fenced landscapes at Newhaven in the Northern Territory in August 2021 and to Mallee Cliffs National Park in NSW in September 2021. \n\n, plans were in place to reintroduce the species to the Pilliga Forest in NSW, and to Dirk Hartog Island in WA.\n\nIt is a key species in the faunal reconstruction project on South Australia's Yorke Peninsula, formerly named the Great Southern Ark (2019), renamed Marna Banggara in June 2020 in honour of the Narungga people, who are the traditional owners of the region. As part of this project, the woylie's reintroduction is being supported by large-scale fencing and the baiting of feral cats and foxes. In August 2021, 40 woylies were translocated from Wedge Island to the Dhilba Guuranda\u2013Innes National Park on the Yorke Peninsula. Surveillance trapping in 2022 confirmed population survival and breeding. In July 2022, 36 woylies were translocated from WA for the first time, with the permission of the Noongar traditional custodians, in a move that will boost genetic diversity.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Australian Wildlife Conservancy woylie fact sheet\n\nBettongia\nMammals of the Northern Territory\nMammals of Western Australia\nMammals of South Australia\nMammals of Victoria (Australia)\nEndemic fauna of Australia\nMammals described in 1837\nTaxa named by John Edward Gray", "Pawling is a village in Dutchess County, New York, United States.

The film was produced by the Fox Film Corporation (later 20th Century Fox) and directed by Emmett J. Flynn based on a screenplay by Bernard McConville. It is notable as the first film adaptation of Twain's novel and as the second film about time travel to the past (after The Ghost of Slumber Mountain).\n\nThe film stars Harry Myers as the titular Yankee Martin Cavendish. After reading Twain's novel, Cavendish dreams that he, like Twain's protagonist Henry Morgan, is transported back to the time of King Arthur (Charles Clary), where he must use modern know-how to outwit the king's foes Morgan le Fay (Rosemary Theby) and Merlin (William V. Mong). The screenplay modernizes the novel with many contemporary references, including mentions of Ford Model Ts, the Volstead Act, and the Battle of the Argonne Forest. The film was popular, and its success likely encouraged Fox to produce the later sound film adaptation of the novel, A Connecticut Yankee. According to author Barbara Leaming, the film's hanging scene inspired Tom Hepburn, brother of Katharine Hepburn, to commit suicide in 1921.\n\nThe film is incomplete in the Library of Congress, and only reels 2, 4 and 7 survive.\n\nPlot summary\n\nCast\n Harry Myers as Martin Cavendish (as Harry C.

The organization addresses hunger and homelessness and poverty on Long Island by providing food, shelter, long-term housing, and supportive services. It is estimated that the INN feeds about 5,000 Long Islanders each week.\n\nHistory \n\nThe INN was founded as a soup kitchen in Hempstead, NY in 1983 by a group of volunteers headed by Patricia O'Connor and Michael Moran, then a chaplain at Hofstra University. Thirty people responded to their call for volunteers to create a soup kitchen; the effort was a success and news about the soup kitchen spread through word of mouth.\n\nIn 1984, the organization expanded to offer solutions for homelessness. The group opened an emergency shelter. The INN subsequently developed into a comprehensive organization with a variety of programs to aid the hungry and homeless on Long Island.\n\nAs of 2013, INN operations had grown to include 14 soup kitchens, three emergency shelters, and one long-term housing program. The INN is composed of people from many ethnic and faith communities and does not discriminate toward members of any religion, race, or ethnicity.\n\nOne of the initial volunteers, Jean Kelly, now serves as Executive Director of the organization. The group hosts an annual dinner, called the INNkeepers' Ball, to honor INN volunteers, to raise awareness and to raise funds for the organization. Over $1 million was raised at the 2013 event.\n\nServices Offered \n\nThe INN offers five services:\n Soup Kitchens: The INN currently operates 10 soup kitchens in 14 locations across Long Island. Soup kitchens are available for those who need immediate food.\n Emergency Housing: The INN operates three emergency housing shelters. Two of these shelters provide housing for homeless families and one for men who are temporarily experiencing homelessness. The INN works with the Nassau County Department of Social Services to find appropriate housing and achieve the goal of permanent housing for those in need.\n Long-Term Housing: By working with families who are experiencing homelessness, The INN can provide families with homes and resources to reach goals of self-sufficiency and independence.\n Center for Transformative Change: In 2016, The INN opened the Center for Transformative Change directly adjacent to the Mary Brennan INN soup kitchen in Hempstead. The goal of the CTC is to serve as a Resource Center to assist guests of the soup kitchen to improve their life circumstances and/or become self-sufficient. The facility also houses a Clothing Boutique, where guests can acquire free clothing, including business attire for interviews or a new job, and housewares.\n Supportive Services: Along with providing food and shelter to those in need, The INN also supplies Long Islanders with counseling and case management, tenancy and home management, and educational tutoring for children and parents as well as vocational training.\n\nNotable Partnerships \n\nIn 2010, Howitt Middle School in Farmingdale, NY held a dance marathon fundraiser and was able to raise $10,167 which they donated to The INN. In 2011, Ice Girls from the New York Islanders hockey team supported a food drive in Mineola by volunteering their time to help collect food and greet passersby.\n\nIn 2013, Walmart donated $75,000 to The INN to aid Long Islanders during the holiday season.\n\nSee also\n\n List of food banks\n\nReferences \n\nFood banks in New York (state)\nOrganizations established in 1983\nNon-profit organizations based in New York (state)", "Maurice Clifford Rootes (12 April 1917 \u2013 17 June 1997) was a British film editor.\n\nFilmography\n Escape from Broadmoor (1948)\n The Last Days of Dolwyn (1949)\n Maria Chapdelaine (1950)\n A Tale of Five Cities (1951)\n The Last Page (1952)\n The Gambler and the Lady (1952)\n Four Sided Triangle (1953)\n Spaceways (1953)\n Blood Orange (1953)\n Face the Music (1954)\n Murder by Proxy (1954)\n Windfall (1955)\n Abdulla the Great (1955)\n Reluctant Bride (1955)\n One Way Out (1955)\n Three Crooked Men (1958)\n A Woman of Mystery (1958)\n On the Run (1958)\n A Woman Possessed (1958)\n She Knows Y'Know (1962)\n Jason and the Argonauts (1963)\n Siege of the Saxons (1963)\n Clash by Night (1963)\n First Men in the Moon (1964)\n Custer of the West (1967)\n Krakatoa: East of Java (1969)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\n1917 births\n1997 deaths\nBritish film editors", "The G\u00fatt\u00f3slagurinn was a street riot in the center of Reykjav\u00edk that occurred on 9 November 1932.\n\nThe battle broke out between the police and workers at the G\u00f3\u00f0templarah\u00fas Reykjav\u00edkur (popularly known as 'G\u00fatt\u00f3').

The fight ended as police retreated and the proposal was withdrawn.\n\nSources\n B\u00e6jarstj\u00f3rnarfundi hleypt upp: Samfylkingin, komm\u00fanistar og s\u00f3s\u00edalistar ger\u00f0u \u00ed g\u00e6r \u00fat \u00e1r\u00e1s gegn b\u00e6jarstj\u00f3rn og l\u00f6greglu; grein \u00ed Morgunbla\u00f0inu 10. n\u00f3vember 1932\n G\u00f6tubardaginn \u00e1 mi\u00f0vikudaginn; grein \u00ed Morgunbla\u00f0inu 1932\n Hvort ber a\u00f0 vir\u00f0a; grein \u00ed Morgunbla\u00f0inu 1979\n\n1932 in Iceland\n1932 in politics\n1932 riots\nEvents in Reykjav\u00edk", "Bobby Vernon (born Sylvion de Jardin) (March 9, 1897 \u2013 June 28, 1939) was an American comedic actor in silent films. He later became a writer and comedy supervisor at Paramount for W. C. Fields and  Bing Crosby, when the sound era arrived. Blue-eyed with medium brown hair, he stood five feet and two-and-a-half inches, making him perfect for juvenile comedy roles. His comedies were popular with children.\n\nLife and career\nThe Chicago-born son of entertainers Harry Burns and Dorothy Vernon (born Dorothy Baird), Bobby first worked as a newsboy in San Francisco. He was known as \"Buttons,\" the singing newsboy. Sid Grauman recognized Vernon's talent and started him singing at the Empress Theatre at the age of eleven. Later, he became one of the stock actors in the vaudeville act Kolb and Dill. After three years of working with them, Max Dill broke his leg in their show, \"The Rollicking Girl.\" At the age of sixteen, Vernon replaced him for three weeks.\n\nHis first experience in screen was at the age of sixteen in Universal Studios's Joker comedies. Early in his career, he was cast as an old man. By 1915, he began working for Keystone Studios. He starred in many romantic comedies with Gloria Swanson as his leading lady. The pair became popular for their great screen chemistry. However, as director Charley Chase recalled, Swanson was \"frightened to death\" of her co-star's dangerous stunts. He later described his Keystone days to Motion Picture Classic:\n\nIn December 1917, he began working for the Christie Film Company.\n\nOn September 9, 1918, Vernon left the Christie studio to serve during World War I at the submarine base at San Pedro, Los Angeles.\n\nVernon's career never progressed to feature films. He was busy making two-reel comedies. In a 1929 interview, he said:\n\nA few months prior to the interview, he underwent a dangerous spine operation. The doctors claimed it was from years of taking falls.\n\nVernon sang and danced at Grauman's Theatre to great applause in February 1930.\n\nVernon completed his 12-year contract with the Christie Film Company in 1929. He then began freelancing. His first sound comedy was Cry Baby, directed by Del Lord in 1930. This was not his first sound film, as he made a brief cameo in The Voice of Hollywood #3 in 1929.\n\nIn 1933, after an acting career of 19 years, Vernon turned to writing. His last credited work in film was for Geronimo, released in 1940.\n\nFamily\nVernon married Angelina Repetto (1898-1981) of St. Louis, Missouri; the couple had one child, Barbara Dorothy Vernon, born in 1922. Angelina was the sister-in-law of Reggie Morris, thus making the two men brothers-in-law.\n\nDeath\nVernon died of a heart attack on June 28, 1939, in Hollywood, California, aged 42. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.\n\nPartial filmography\n\n The Hungry Actors (1915)\n Fatty and the Broadway Stars (1915)\n A Dash of Courage (1916)\n Hearts and Sparks (1916)\n A Social Cub (1916)\n The Danger Girl (1916)\n Haystacks and Steeples (1916)\n The Nick of Time Baby (1916)\n Teddy at the Throttle (1917)\n Whose Baby?

Leroy Douresseaux comments that the manga is \"more or less a comic romp with bickering boys, and the love is less lust than it is lovey-dovey\" despite its yaoi genre.  Mania's Patricia Beard finds the relationship between Miki and Houjou to be the best developed and most emotionally satisfying, and noted that the potentially offensive \"aggressive sexual dynamics\" of the school are toned down in the second volume.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n2008 manga\nDigital Manga Publishing titles\nHoubunsha manga\nManga anthologies\nJosei manga\nYaoi anime and manga", "Weldon Santos de Andrade (born 6 August 1980), known simply as Weldon, is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays for Clube Atl\u00e9tico Juventus as a striker.\n\nClub career\nWeldon was born in Santo Andr\u00e9, S\u00e3o Paulo.

He specialises in \"n\u00e1nd\u00e0n\" (\u7537\u65e6) roles, which is male who plays female role in Peking opera.

In August 2015 Li Yugang and \"Lady Zhaojun\" stage production were nominated at 4th Denny award in Beijing for the International Excellence in Theatrical Arts in four categories.\n\nEarly life\n\nLi was born into a farming family in Jilin province in 1978.  His parents were too poor to send him to college even though he was accepted by the provincial Art College. He worked in various jobs in Changchun after finishing high school.\n\nLi went to Xi'an to work as a waiter in an entertainment club after he became jobless in Changchun for a full year.  He was fascinated by the singers whom he came across for the first time in his life. Soon, he was allowed to sing a few songs and became a club singer. His breakthrough came when one day a female colleague didn't show up and he had to take her place singing in female voice. \"That's how I started with female roles\" recalled Li Yugang. His talent to sing both male and female voices impressed the audience. The owner of the establishment hired him full-time and he started to have a proper job. From 1998 to 2006, he began to be trained professionally and to develop his singing and acting in nan dan (male plays female role in Peking Opera).\n\nCareer\n\nIn 2006, Li came to prominence after he came third in the Star Boulevard (), a nationwide talent competition programme on CCTV. His performance in \"Farewell My Concubine\" () and \"The Drunken Beauty\" (), both from the famous Peking Opera made him an overnight sensation. He became a highly sought-after performer afterwards.\n\nThe following year, Li became an unprecedented success when he gave his first solo performance in Beijing: \"Where Flowers are Unbounded\" (). In 2009, he was invited to join the \"National Performing and Dancing Company\" and became China's First Class Artist (National Treasure). In that same year Li Yugang was invited to perform at Sydney Opera House in Australia, the second Chinese artist to have done so, and was awarded Southern Cross Gold Prize for Culture by the Australian Government.\n \nFrom 2010-2014, for stage performance, Li created \"Flower in Mirror, Moon in Water\" ( and \"The Painting of Four Beauties\" ( Together he performed over 100 shows in the country and internationally.

It was released in 1983, and was the second album Mink DeVille recorded for Atlantic Records, and Atlantic brought in two in-house producers, Howard Albert and Ron Albert, to produce the album.\n\nMink DeVille as a rock group had effectively ceased to exist as a band; only lead singer Willy DeVille remained from the original band. For this album, Willy DeVille reached deeper into his Latin roots, even recording a salsa number, \"Demasiado Corazon.\"  A single, \u201cEach Word\u2019s a Beat of My Heart,\u201d reached number 89 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. Two percussionists from the Latin dance/disco band Foxy, Richie Puente and Joe Galdo, played on the album.

Simply, elegantly excellent.\u201d\n\nAllmusic said about Where Angels Fear to Tread, \u201cDeVille and his band were burning through the pages of rock and R&B history (there are a couple of doo wop- and New Orleans-flavored cuts as well) with raw swagger and astonishing musicianship. Why they didn't catch on and George Thorogood did is a mystery that will be up to '80s historians to figure out.\u201d\n\nOther information\nBoris Kinberg, a percussionist in The Mink DeVille Band, considered \"Lilly's Daddy's Cadillac\" one of the best songs Willy DeVille ever wrote. \"It's a brilliant song. It\u2019s a mini-film. In a three-minute song you have an hour and a half movie.

The single included a radio version and extended version of the song as well as \"Ballad of the Hoodlum Priest\" (from DeVille's Loup Garou).\n\nThe album\u2019s title comes from the Johnny Mercer song \u201cFools Rush In (Where Angels Fear to Tread),\u201d not from the novel by that title written by E.

Mary was renamed Mathinna when she was about six years old \n\nIn 1837 Sir John Franklin was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Van Diemen's Land for a term of four years It was during this time that Sir John Franklin and his wife, Lady Jane Franklin requested an Aboriginal boy or girl. Mathinna was sent to Hobart to live with the Franklin's although she was not an orphan. Mathinna was raised with Sir John's daughter Eleanor.\n\nJust one fragment of a letter written by Mathinna reveals what the transition from living with her family at Flinders Island to living at Government House in Hobart Town must have been like:\n\nWhen Franklin was recalled to England, they left Mathinna at Queen\u2019s Orphan School in Hobart in 1843. Only eight years old, she found it difficult to adjust to her new surroundings. She was sent back to Flinders Island in 1844, at the age of nine, and then sent back to Queen's Orphan School. In 1851, when she was about 16, she returned to the Aboriginal settlement at Oyster Cove, west of Hobart.\n\nShe drowned\u2014according to one account\u2014in a puddle while drunk on 1 September 1852. She was 17 or 18 years old.\n\nMathinna is believed to have been buried in the Oyster Cove Aboriginal cemetery and is likely to have been among the remains exhumed in 1907 and taken to the University of Melbourne. After a campaign by the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre, all remains from Oyster Cove were returned and cremated in a four-day ceremony in 1985.\n\nThe town of Mathinna is named after her, as is the mushroom Entoloma mathinnae.\n\nSee also\nList of kidnappings\n\nCultural depictions of Mathinna\nMathinna's life has inspired or been mentioned in several literary and dramatic works.

The act is enforced by the Federal Trade Commission. The act expanded controls over telemarketing and gave more control to prescribe rules to the Federal Trade Commission. After the passage of the act, the Federal Trade Commission is required to (1) define and prohibit deceptive telemarketing practices; (2) keep telemarketers from practices a reasonable consumer would see as being coercive or invasions of privacy; (3) set restrictions on the time of day and night that unsolicited calls can be made to consumers; (4) to require the nature of the call to be disclosed at the start of any unsolicited call that is made with the purpose of trying to sell something.\n\nBackground\nThe Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act was deemed necessary in an advancing world. With the new waves of telemarketing and digital data Congress found that there are unique differences in telemarketing that deem new rules and regulations necessary.\n\nCongressional Findings\nIt was determined that Telemarketing is different from other sales activities due to the fact that sales activities can be carried out by sellers across state lines without direct contact with the consumer. Telemarketers also can be very mobile, easily moving from state to state. With this being stated it is easy to see how there has been a rise in telemarketing fraud, which was found to be of such a magnitude that the Federal Trade Commission needed more resources to deal with it. There was found to be an estimated $40 billion a year lost to telemarketing fraud, and that consumers are victimized by non-monetary forms of telemarketing fraud as well. It was concluded that Congress should enact legislation to offer consumers protection from these telemarketing threats.\n\nEnforcement and Challenges\nAs part of complying with the act the Federal Trade Commission put new provisions on telemarketing. These new regulations include the Do Not Call (DNC) provisions and the Telemarketing Sales Rule (TSR). However, with the establishment of these provisions, companies objected to it and some filed suits arguing their rights as a business were being infringed upon. While the 10th circuit court ruled in favor of industry in regards to rules on customer proprietary network information earlier making it seem as though industry was going to win all consumer data cases; when industry objected to the DNC the court ruled in favor of the government stating that the Federal Trade Commission has a right to make and enforce the DNC provision.\n\nIn April 2018, a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the FTC had not violated the Administrative Procedure Act when it issued a 2016 staff letter reversing the conclusion of a 2009 staff letter that had found use of soundboard technology did not violated the act.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act entry in FTC Legal Library\n As codified in 15 U.S.C. chapter 87 of the United States Code from the LII\n As codified in 15 U.S.C. chapter 87 of the United States Code from the US House of Representatives\n Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act (PDF/details) as amended in the GPO Statute Compilations collection\n Summaries for the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, Library of Congress, (1994)\n Privacy Law: Positive Theory and Normative Practice; Anita L.

The Plymouth Company had 40 patentees at that point, and established the Council for New England to oversee their efforts, but it stopped operating in 1624;.\n\nThe Council for New England was not dissolved until 1635 and issued several patents after 1624, including one to John Mason for New Hampshire and to New Plymouth Colony with the Bradford patent of 1630.\n\nReferences\n\n1606 establishments in England\n1624 disestablishments in England\nEnglish colonization of the Americas\nHistory of New England\nVirginia Company", "Sir Charles Hart Bright   (25 November 191216 May 1983) was a Justice of the Supreme Court of South Australia and chancellor of Flinders University.\n\nEarly life\nBright was born on 25 November 1912 in Norwood, a suburb of Adelaide, South Australia, the second child of Baptist minister Charles Bright and his second wife Annie Florence (n\u00e9e Hollidge). He attended Scotch College and studied law at the University of Adelaide, following which he was admitted to the South Australian Bar on 15 December 1934.\n\nCareer\nBright started out working for Shierlaw, Frisby Smith & Romilly Harry, before becoming partners with O. C. Isaachsen in 1940. Bright served as full-time captain of the Australian Army Legal Department from 4 January 1943 till 1 November 1944, when he was became a reserve officer. In 1945, Bright and Isaachsen had a new partner, Zelling, although their law firm was dissolved in 1954. Bright, who preferred commercial and tax-related cases, then partnered with D. B. McLeod. In 1961, he was appointed as president of the Law Society of South Australia, a post he held till 1963. From 1962 to 1963, he was a councillor at the Law Council of Australia. In October 1963, Bright became a judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia. \n\nBright was also active in the wider community. For instance, he sat on the Physiotherapists Board of South Australia for some ten years and was president of the Minda Home in Brighton for six years, which caters to individuals with mental disabilities. He was also vice-president of the Musica Viva Society of Australia and the Australian Red Cross Society in South Australia. Bright became the first pro-chancellor of the South Australia-based Flinders University, and chaired its finance and buildings committee. In 1971, he became the university's chancellor, taking over Sir Mark Mitchell. Bright retired from the bench in December 1978 and was knighted in 1980. In view of his declining health, he stepped down as chancellor in 1983.\n\nPersonal life and death\nBright was raised as a Protestant. On 31 August 1940, Bright married doctor Elizabeth Holden (n\u00e9e Flaxman), whose great-grandfather was Charles Flaxman. They had a daughter and two sons. After resigning as chancellor of Flinders University, Bright was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters on 13 May 1983. He died on 16 May 1983 in his home in North Adelaide. The cause of death was cancer. Bright's book on his wife's great-grandfather, whom he had researched on while studying for a postgraduate degree in history at Flinders University, was posthumously released in the same year. The Sir Charles Bright Scholarship Trust was set up in 1985 for disabled South Australians looking to pursue tertiary education.\n\nReferences\n\n1912 births\n1983 deaths\nJudges of the Supreme Court of South Australia\nPeople from Adelaide\nAustralian Knights Commander of the Order of the British Empire\nChancellors of Flinders University\nDeaths from cancer in South Australia", "Alexei Sidorov, sometimes transliterated as Aleksei Sidorov, (December 29, 1971 \u2013 October 9, 2003), a Russian journalist and editor-in-chief for the Tolyatinskoye Obozreniye (Togliatti Review) in Tolyatti, Samara Oblast, Russia, was known for his investigations into the Russian mafia. Alexei was killed in what was suspected to be an organized crime contract killing.\n\nPersonal \nAlexei Sidorov lived with his wife in an apartment complex in Tolyatti, Russia. He had one known child, Leonid Sidorov.\n\nCareer \nSidorov started out as a journalist for Togliatti Review, a local newspaper. He worked under his mentor Valery Ivanov, who was the editor in 2002. He became known for his investigations into dealings by the Russian mafia. Sidorov took over as editor-in-chief for the paper after the murder of Ivanov by Russian mafia, and continued the work that Ivanov was doing and overseeing all investigative reporting for the paper until his death six months later. During the time of Ivanov's murder, Sidorov told the New York Times, \"They can't kill us all.\" He was then murdered about six months later.\n\nDeath\nSidorov's wife, Olga Lapitskaya, was waiting for him to return on October 9, 2003, when she heard Sidorov call for help using the apartment buzzer. She ran downstairs to  discover him bleeding on the steps of their building. She called emergency services but even with their arrival, Sidorov did not survive his wounds. After an investigation it was found that Alexei was attacked by two men while walking up to his complex. He was stabbed repeatedly and left to die. While it was initially reported that Sidorov's death was not a product of the Russian Mafia, further investigation showed that he was in fact the victim of a mafia hit. The two cases have never been solved.\n\nContext \nBeing a journalist in Russia is said to be one of the most dangerous jobs. Russian police are not good with cooperating in investigations which allowed the mob to spread crimes all across Russia. Towns like Togliatti exist all over Russia, journalists have to worry about the danger that follows their job. The Russian mafia has made it clear that they do not want to be bothered. While Russian civilians turn to law enforcement to protect them, the Russian police say they are unable to deal with the threats the Russian mob brings.\n\nImpact \nThe death of Alexei Sidorov has given views of the danger that Russian journalists are facing in the past and the present. Lack of law enforcement and prosecution of those who murder journalists are the primary reasons Russian journalists worry about their safety. Russian law enforcement located in places like Togliatti, blame victims for getting involved in the mob cases rather than help create a more safe community for everyone living there. Sidorov's murder also brings to light the shortcomings of the Russian media and court system. The police only continue to investigate murders like Sidorov to appease public disapproval. The Russian courts are also at fault because they are showing how powerful the mob is by setting suspects free who come into the equation after long investigations.\n\nReactions \nSidorov's death sparked new discussions regarding the safety of journalists in Russia. PEN America wrote a letter to the President Dmitry Medvedev demanding investigations to put an end to immunity in the case of journalists that were murdered in Russia.\n\nKo\u00efchiro Matsuura, director-general of UNESCO condemned the journalist's death, \"The murder of Alexi Sidorov marks yet another attack on democracy and transparency in Russia and must be condemned as such.\"\n\nState Deputy Vladimir Ryzhkov said, \"Our journalists have no protection, and that tells you that journalism is a very risky profession and that there is a great deal of unhappiness in society.\"\n\nSee also\n List of journalists killed in Russia\n\nReferences\n\n1971 births\n2003 deaths\nMurdered Russian journalists\nDeaths by stabbing in Russia\nJournalists killed in Russia", "Unidos Por La Paz is a live 2 disc album (twelfth overall) set by Latin American Mexican rock band Man\u00e1.

The fort was first built in 1666 by soldiers of the Carignan-Sali\u00e8res Regiment of France who had travelled to New France to assist the young colony. It was part of a series of forts built along the Richelieu River. Over the years, it was destroyed and rebuilt several times, but it is, after Quebec City, the military site that has been occupied non-stop for the longest time in Canada. The fort is designated as a National Historic Site of Canada, and it currently houses the Royal Military College Saint-Jean. The fort has been continually occupied since 1748, and is the core from which the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec grew around. Fort Saint-Jean played a crucial role in the British defense strategy during the 1775 American invasion of the Province of Quebec.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst fort\nIn 1663, the French King Louis XIV decided to take direct command of his New France colony, which had been previously colonized and managed by wealthy merchant associations. As the Iroquois were very often leading punitive expeditions on the New France territories and were continuously trying to steal away the French allies' hunting territories, Louis XIV decided to send the whole Carignan-Sali\u00e8res Regiment to build a series of forts along the Richelieu River and Lake Champlain, which explains why the area was later named the Vall\u00e9e des Forts (literally: the Forts Valley), and to lead a punitive expedition against the Iroquois. The first Fort Saint-Jean was built along the Richelieu River by the Carignan-Sali\u00e8res Regiment in 1666 for that purpose. This first fort is believed to have been a small square-shaped fort with four bastions made of wooden palisades. It was located right after the Chambly rapids, a highly strategic position that allowed the French to monopolize a very good portage location. The French offensive into Iroquois territory was a great success and thus, a peace treaty was signed between the two parties in 1667. In 1672, after several peaceful years, the Governor of the colony decided to abandon several forts that had become useless along the Richelieu River, including Fort Saint-Jean. Because of its strategic location, Fort Saint-Jean was later to be revived, unlike other French forts such as Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Sainte-Anne.\n\nSecond fort\nThe second French fort Saint-Jean was built in 1748 because of tensions between France and England arising from the War of the Austrian Succession. It was a fort of two hundred feet by two hundred feet that had four bastions, two of which were made in stone. This fort was an important relay between Montreal and Fort St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric, which was located in the south of Lake Champlain, because a road linked Fort Saint-Jean to La Prairie and allowed the communications between Montreal and St. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric to be considerably shorter. The second fort Saint-Jean was given the sympathetic nickname of \"Fort aux Maringouins\" (Mosquitoes Fort) because of the swampy climate of the area. This fort was destroyed by French soldiers in 1760 during the French and Indian War. As there were not enough men left to defend the fort against a three to five thousand-man British army coming up from the Richelieu River to take Montreal, the French decided to abandon the fort and before they left for Montreal, they set fire to it as to not leave it to their enemy. The stone bastions of the fort that survived the fire were afterward used as a relay by the British troops.\n\n1760 British fort and the American invasion\nBecause of the dangers posed by the thirteen rebellious colonies to the south, the British in 1775 erected a third fort on the site of the previous fort. A year before the Declaration of Independence transformed the rebellious colonies into the United States of America, two small armies of rebels invaded the Province of Quebec in an attempt to defeat the British on Canadian soil and to raise Canadian opposition to royal British rule. Fort Saint-Jean played a vital role in the defence of the Province of Quebec against the Americans; indeed, it was the principal defense of Montreal against General Richard Montgomery\u2019s army, which had planned to use the Richelieu River to reach Montreal, then march to Quebec City. The garrison of Fort Saint-Jean fought valiantly against the American troops during a forty-five-day siege before surrendering to the invaders. The siege of Fort Saint-Jean considerably weakened and slowed the American offensive: Montgomery's expedition arrived at Quebec City early in December instead of mid-October, and only three hundred of his men, out of about two thousand, actually reached Quebec City.\n\nBecause of bad weather and the weakened state of the few remaining troops, the Americans failed to take Quebec City in their assault on December 31, 1775. After British reinforcements arrived from England the next Spring, the Americans abandoned and burnt the forts, including Fort Saint-Jean, that they had taken north of Lake Champlain. But, fearing a new American invasion, the British reconstructed a strengthened Fort in 1776, adding a series of new ramparts. They also built in Saint-Jean an important shipyard to assemble the shallow-draft boats needed to follow the Americans on Lake Champlain. These boats soon would take part in the Battle of Valcour Island.\n\n19th-century fortifications\nFort Saint-Jean lost much of its importance after the end of the American War of Independence in 1783 and was only used as a relay during the second American Invasion in 1812\u20131814. However, the Patriot Revolt episodes of 1837\u20131838 convinced the British of the need to fortify again fort Saint-Jean and new buildings were added to the fort. Some of those buildings, built in 1839 by the Royal Engineers, are still standing and being used nowadays on the site.\n\nAt the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, the fort was mostly used as a training school for several groups and regiments, The Royal Canadian Regiment (then known simply as the Infantry School Corps) and the Royal Canadian Dragoons among them. During the First World War, the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment, who was back then only a battalion, was founded and trained at Fort Saint-Jean before being sent to Europe. After the war, the 22nd battalion became the first officially French-speaking Canadian regiment under the name of the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment (known in English as the Vandoos). Known between the wars as Cavalry Barracks, fort Saint-Jean also served as a garrison for a Squadron and a company of The Royal Canadian Regiment.\n\nColl\u00e8ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean (CMR) years\n\nIn 1952, the Royal Military College Saint-Jean was created to allow a greater number of French-speaking Canadians to become officers in the Canadian Army, Royal Canadian Navy and Royal Canadian Air Force, thus becoming the first bilingual military college in Canada. Initially, only first- and second-year courses were offered and cadets had to complete the remainder of their education at the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario. Over time, the college began offering third- and fourth-year courses and in 1985, it became accredited to grant its own diploma when it received its own Academic Charter.\n\nIn 1995, the CMR was closed due to budget cuts and classes were transferred to RMC Kingston. In order to maintain the CMR site and its buildings in good condition, a non-profit body was created, the Corporation du fort Saint-Jean. The \"Campus du Fort Saint-Jean\" then became a commercial and public site. The Corporation du Fort Saint-Jean leased some of its educational facilities to institutions such as the Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec \u00e0 Montr\u00e9al (UQ\u00c0M) for their local programmes while also renting out other facilities for short-term events such as banquets, conventions and weddings. Moreover, the House of Commons' Language School was established in the Massey Building, where many federal Members of Parliament came to improve their French. However, the site never completely lost its military educational vocation; preparatory-year cadets and groups of officers continued to follow courses at Fort Saint-Jean.\n\nIn 2008, the military college was reopened and currently offers classes to all preparatory and first year cadets in all programs. Students past first year can study International Studies and obtain their degree from the college, as it was granted university status in 2021. However, CMR St-Jean remains a commercial site that is open to public, which is unique in Canada. There are both a museum and a multisport complex (including an ice rink and a swimming pool) located on-site.\n\nFort Saint Jean Museum\n\nFort Saint-Jean Museum was founded in 1960 as a private collection of artifacts, military objects and historical documents. With the years, the museum expanded its collection and new offers several instructive exhibitions about the site's rich military past and history. The Museum was first located in the Old Guardhouse built by the Royal Engineer between 1883 and 1889, but was relocated in 2005 to the CMR's old Protestant Church to better accommodate its exhibition and customers.\n\nThe Mus\u00e9e du Fort Saint Jean has collected some 2,588 pictures for an online photo album illustrative of the history of Coll\u00e8ge militaire royal de Saint-Jean from 1952 to 1984.\n\nArchaeology\nIn the early 1980s, Parks Canada led archaeological digs at Fort Saint Jean and discovered on that occasion the foundations of a part of the 1748 French fort and plenty of interesting artifacts of both the French and British Regimes. In collaboration with Fort Saint Jean Museum, the Royal Military College of Saint-Jean and Universit\u00e9 Laval, a five-year-long digging project (2009\u20132013) taking place in the summer at Fort Saint-Jean. Archaeology students for University Laval are doing excavations from mid-July to mid-August in order to find out more about the past of the site.\n\nFeatures and historical buildings\n\nA metal National Historic Site of Canada plaque at the main gate of the college describing the history of Fort Saint-Jean reads,\n\nThe DeLery Building, an academic classroom building, was named after Gaspard-Joseph Chaussegros de L\u00e9ry, a military engineer who built Fort Saint-Jean in 1748. The Officers' Mess, the La Galissoni\u00e8re Pavilion, and the Montcalm Pavilion are British buildings that were built in 1839 by the Royal Engineers.\n\nRichelieu and Iberville Squadrons use the Cartier Building, while Tracy and Jolliet Squadrons use the Champlain Building.

Basically, it is represented by a miniature uterus comprising a smooth muscle wall lined by endometrium thus outlining a uterus anatomical structure. Some of the reported cases have been associated to urinary tract and internal genitalia malformations whereas others appeared as a solitary finding. The term endomyometriosis has also been applied to this lesion.\n\nDifferent pathogenetic views have been suggested for this anomaly: a) a metaplastic change in endometriosis foci bringing about smooth muscle hyperplasia; b) a congenital anomaly due to fusion defects of the M\u00fcllerian ducts; and c) a sub-coelomic transformation of the mesenchyme.\n\nULM has also been reported associated to endometrial carcinoma and breast cancer. A clonal chromosome deletion 2p21 was found in endomyometriosis by Verhest et al. while Pai evidenced a strict relationship among ULM, breast cancer and elevated serum CA125 supporting the view of ULM being either hormone-dependent or a form of endometriosis. There have been reports of the finding of occurrence of endometriosis in leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata.\n\nMore than 15 cases of ULM have been reported so far. A case of ULM was reported 22 years after total hysterectomy, another 17 years after. Abdominal pain and a palpable mass are among the main clinical findings.\n\nAnyway, the phenomenon of smooth muscle cell metaplasia occurring in association with endometriosis (endomyometriosis), as well as of smooth muscle differentiation at endometrio-myometrial junction independently from actually engendering uterus-like configurations in several locations of the pelvis, have been pointed out by several authors.\n\nA magnetic resonance account of this lesion type has been provided by Menn et al.\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading\n Kaeser SA, Ruchti C, Frankhauser G (2008).

They can be naturally occurring or synthesized through the individual expression of viral structural proteins, which can then self assemble into the virus-like structure. Combinations of structural capsid proteins from different viruses can be used to create recombinant VLPs. Both in-vivo assembly (i.e., assembly inside E. coli bacteria via recombinant co-expression of multiple proteins) and in-vitro assembly (i.e., protein self-assembly in a reaction vessel using stoichiometric quantities of previously purified proteins) have been successfully shown to form virus-like particles. VLPs derived from the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and composed of the small HBV derived surface antigen (HBsAg) were described in 1968 from patient sera. VLPs have been produced from components of a wide variety of virus families including Parvoviridae (e.g. adeno-associated virus), Retroviridae (e.g. HIV), Flaviviridae (e.g. Hepatitis C virus), Paramyxoviridae (e.g. Nipah) and bacteriophages (e.g. Q\u03b2, AP205). VLPs can be produced in multiple cell culture systems including bacteria, mammalian cell lines, insect cell lines, yeast and plant cells.\n\nVLPs can also refer to structures produced by some LTR retrotransposons (under Ortervirales) in nature. These are defective, immature virions, sometimes containing genetic material, that are generally non-infective due to the lack of a functional viral envelope. In addition, wasps produce polydnavirus vectors with pathogenic genes (but not core viral genes) or gene-less VLPs to help control their host.\n\nApplications\n\nTherapeutic and imaging agents \nVLPs are a candidate delivery system for genes or other therapeutics. These drug delivery agents have been shown to effectively target cancer cells in vitro. It is hypothesized that VLPs may accumulate in tumor sites due to the enhanced permeability and retention effect, which could be useful for drug delivery or tumor imaging.\n\nVaccines\n\nVLPs are useful as vaccines. VLPs contain repetitive, high density displays of viral surface proteins that present conformational viral epitopes that can elicit strong T cell and B cell immune responses. The particles' small radius of roughly 20-200\u00a0nm allows sufficient draining into lymph nodes. Since VLPs cannot replicate, they provide a safer alternative to attenuated viruses. VLPs were used to develop FDA-approved vaccines for Hepatitis B and human papillomavirus, which are commercially available.\n\nA selection of viruslike particle-based vaccines against human papilloma virus (HPV) such as Cervarix by GlaxoSmithKline along with Gardasil and Gardasil-9, are available, produced by Merck & Co. Gardasil consists of recombinant VLPs assembled from the L1 proteins of HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 expressed in yeast. It is adjuvanted with aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate. Gardasil-9 consists of L1 epitopes of 31, 33, 45, 52 and 58 in addition to the listed L1 epitopes found in Gardasil. Cervarix consists of recombinant VLPs assembled from the L1 proteins of HPV types 16 and 18, expressed in insect cells, and is adjuvanted with 3-O-Desacyl-4-monophosphoryl lipid (MPL) A and aluminum hydroxide.\n\nThe first VLP vaccine that addresses malaria, Mosquirix, (RTS,S) has been approved by EU regulators. It was expressed in yeast. RTS,S is a portion of the Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein fused to the Hepatitis B surface antigen (RTS), combined with Hepatitis B surface antigen (S), and adjuvanted with AS01 (consisting of (MPL)A and saponin).\n\nVaccine production can begin as soon as the virus strain is sequenced and can take as little as 12 weeks, compared to 9 months for traditional vaccines. In early clinical trials, VLP vaccines for influenza appeared to provide complete protection against both the Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 and the 1918 flu pandemic. Novavax and Medicago Inc. have run clinical trials of their VLP flu vaccines. Several VLP vaccines for COVID-19, including Novavax, are under development.\n\nVLPs have been used to develop a pre-clinical vaccine candidate against chikungunya virus.\n\nBio-inspired Material Synthesis\nCompartmentalization is a common theme in biology. Nature is full of examples of hierarchically compartmentalized multicomponent structures that self-assembles from individual building blocks. Taking inspiration from nature, synthetic approaches using polymers, phase-separated microdroplets, lipids and proteins have been used to mimic hierarchical compartmentalization of natural systems and to form functional bio-inspired nanomaterials. For example, protein self-assembly was used to encapsulate multiple copies of ferritin protein cages as sub-compartments inside P22 virus-like particle as larger compartment essentially forming a Matryoshka-like nested cage-within-cage structure. The authors further demonstrated stoichiometric encapsulation of cellobiose-hydrolysing \u03b2-glycosidase enzyme CelB along with ferritin protein cages using in-vitro self-assembly strategy to form multi-compartment cell-inspired protein cage structure. Using similar strategy, glutathione biosynthesizing enzymes were encapsulated inside bacteriophage P22 virus-like particles. In a separate research, 3.5\u00a0nm small Cytochrome C with peroxidase-like activity was encapsulated inside a 9\u00a0nm small Dps protein cage to form organelle-inspired protein cage structure.\n\nLipoparticle technology\nThe VLP lipoparticle was developed to aid the study of integral membrane proteins. Lipoparticles are stable, highly purified, homogeneous VLPs that are engineered to contain high concentrations of a conformationally intact membrane protein of interest. Integral Membrane proteins are involved in diverse biological functions and are targeted by nearly 50% of existing therapeutic drugs. However, because of their hydrophobic domains, membrane proteins are difficult to manipulate outside of living cells. Lipoparticles can incorporate a wide variety of structurally intact membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR)s, ion channels and viral Envelopes. Lipoparticles provide a platform for numerous applications including antibody screening, production of immunogens and ligand binding assays.\n\nAssembly\nThe understanding of self-assembly of VLPs was once based on viral assembly. This is rational as long as the VLP assembly takes place inside the host cell (in vivo), though the self-assembly event was found in vitro from the very beginning of the study about viral assembly. Study also reveals that in vitro assembly of VLPs competes with aggregation and certain mechanisms exist inside the cell to prevent the formation of aggregates while assembly is ongoing.\n\nLinking targeting groups to VLP surfaces\nAttaching proteins, nucleic acids, or small molecules to the VLP surface, such as for targeting a specific cell type or for raising an immune response is useful. In some cases a protein of interest can be genetically fused to the viral coat protein. However, this approach sometimes leads to impaired VLP assembly and has limited utility if the targeting agent is not protein-based. An alternative is to assemble the VLP and then use chemical crosslinkers, reactive unnatural amino acids or SpyTag/SpyCatcher reaction in order to covalently attach the molecule of interest. This method is effective at directing the immune response against the attached molecule, thereby inducing high levels of neutralizing antibody and even being able to break tolerance to self-proteins displayed on VLPs.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \nViral structural proteins", "The 2009 Bauer Watertechnology Cup was a professional tennis tournament played on indoor carpet courts.

The best quality of Jamawar is built with Pashmina. The brocaded parts are woven in similar threads of silk or polyester. Most of the designs seen today are floral, with the kairy as the predominant motif. Historically handmade items, some shawls took a couple of decades to complete; consequently, original Jamawar shawls are highly valued. Modern, machine-made Jamawar prints, produced in cities such as Kashmir and other parts of Himachal Pradesh cost less to buy but handmade Jamawar are very expensive.\n\nTraders introduced this Chinese silk cloth to India, mainly from Samarkand and Bukhara and it gained immense popularity among the royalty and the aristocracy. Kings and nobles bought the woven fabric by the yard, wearing it as a gown or using it as a wrap or shawl. Jamawar weaving centres in India developed in the holy cities and the trade centres. The most well known Jamawar weaving centre is Kashmir and Punjab in India.\n\nDue to its rich and fine raw materials, the rich and powerful merchants used Jamawar and noblemen of the time, who could not only afford it but could even commission the weavers to make the fabric for them, as in the case of the Mughals. Emperor Akbar was one of its greatest patrons. He brought many weavers from East Turkestan to Kashmir.\n\n==References==\n\nIndian clothing\nCulture of Jammu and Kashmir\nShawls and wraps\nIndian shawls and wraps", "Dubovka () is the name of several inhabited localities in Russia.\n\nUrban localities\nDubovka, Dubovsky District, Volgograd Oblast, a town in Dubovsky District of Volgograd Oblast; administratively incorporated as a town of district significance\n\nRural localities\nDubovka, Republic of Bashkortostan, a village in Nizhnebaltachevsky Selsoviet of Tatyshlinsky District of the Republic of Bashkortostan\nDubovka, Komsomolsky District, Chuvash Republic, a village in Komsomolskoye Rural Settlement of Komsomolsky District of the Chuvash Republic\nDubovka, Krasnoarmeysky District, Chuvash Republic, a village in Isakovskoye Rural Settlement of Krasnoarmeysky District of the Chuvash Republic\nDubovka, Krasnochetaysky District, Chuvash Republic, a village in Krasnochetayskoye Rural Settlement of Krasnochetaysky District of the Chuvash Republic\nDubovka, Mariinsko-Posadsky District, Chuvash Republic, a village in Privolzhskoye Rural Settlement of Mariinsko-Posadsky District of the Chuvash Republic\nDubovka, Shumerlinsky District, Chuvash Republic, a settlement in Bolshealgashinskoye Rural Settlement of Shumerlinsky District of the Chuvash Republic\nDubovka, Moscow Oblast, a village in Klenovskoye Rural Settlement of Podolsky District of Moscow Oblast\nDubovka, Ardatovsky District, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, a selo in Zhureleysky Selsoviet of Ardatovsky District of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast\nDubovka, Voskresensky District, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, a village in Yegorovsky Selsoviet of Voskresensky District of Nizhny Novgorod Oblast\nDubovka, Rostov Oblast, a selo in Yulovskoye Rural Settlement of Tselinsky District of Rostov Oblast\nDubovka, Ryazan Oblast, a village in Boretsky Rural Okrug of Sarayevsky District of Ryazan Oblast\nDubovka, Samara Oblast, a settlement in Krasnoarmeysky District of Samara Oblast\nDubovka, Saratov Oblast, a selo in Krasnoarmeysky District of Saratov Oblast\nDubovka, Stavropol Krai, a selo in Dubovsky Selsoviet of Shpakovsky District of Stavropol Krai\nDubovka, Republic of Tatarstan, a village in Bavlinsky District of the Republic of Tatarstan\nDubovka, Bogoroditsky District, Tula Oblast, a village in Novopokrovsky Rural Okrug of Bogoroditsky District of Tula Oblast\nDubovka, Bolshekalmyksky Rural Okrug, Kireyevsky District, Tula Oblast, a village in Bolshekalmyksky Rural Okrug of Kireyevsky District of Tula Oblast\nDubovka, Shvartsevsky, Kireyevsky District, Tula Oblast, a village under the administrative jurisdiction of  the urban-type settlement of  Shvartsevsky in Kireyevsky District of Tula Oblast\nDubovka (village), Uzlovsky District, Tula Oblast, a village in Akimo-Ilyinskaya Rural Administration of Uzlovsky District of Tula Oblast\nDubovka (settlement), Uzlovsky District, Tula Oblast, a settlement in Akimo-Ilyinskaya Rural Administration of Uzlovsky District of Tula Oblast\nDubovka, Kamyshinsky District, Volgograd Oblast, a khutor in Ternovsky Selsoviet of Kamyshinsky District in Volgograd Oblast\nDubovka, Vologda Oblast, a village in Yurovsky Selsoviet of Gryazovetsky District of Vologda Oblast\n\nAbolished rural localities\nDubovka, Omsk Oblast, a village in Martyushevsky Rural Okrug of Tarsky District of Omsk Oblast; abolished in November 2008", "Elburton Villa Football Club is a football club based in Elburton Village, Plymouth, England.

Exit planning differs from succession planning in that the later is a sub-component of exit planning, and refers to the hiring, training and retention of a successor President/CEO of the company in a planned manner. Succession Planning is but one of the many considerations when conducting exit planning. Company owners commonly do not see their company from the standpoint of a potential buyer, and thus, ignore the strategic management of the company. \n\nTo achieve their desired outcomes, business owners often focus their attention on exit planning from the beginning of the investment, in order to prepare adequately for trade and financial sales, make effective use of the buy back option, market their businesses more widely for sale, use intermediaries and get the support of management  Significant value is lost due to an absence of or inadequate exit planning.

Up to one-third of businesses that are closed were successful at their termination\n\nThe three sources of enterprise value in a company are firstly the value of its tangible assets, and secondly the value of its intellectual capital (intangible assets), which consist of human capital, relational capital, and structural capital (including is subcomponents organizational capital, innovation capital and process capital.  Most of a middle-market company's and lower middle market company's value is derived from its relational capital, specifically, its customer relationships.  SMEs, also referred to as middle market companies, create innovation capital (part of structural capital).\n\nMost small-to-medium-sized businesses use a boutique investment bank to market their company in a mergers and acquisitions transaction to potential buyers. Some boutique investment banks also offer exit planning preparation, while certain consulting firms offer one or more of the services needed to conduct exit planning, such as human resources, in connection with succession planning.\n\nPrivate Equity Groups are common acquirers of middle market businesses, whether as Platform companies or add-on or tack-on acquisitions.\n\nIn addition to business aspects, personal considerations need to be taken into consideration, including considerations about estate taxes, capital gains taxes, or other taxes.\n\nReferences \n\nBusiness planning\nCapital (economics)\nCorporate finance\nInvestment banking\nMergers and acquisitions", "Maokopia is an extinct genus of Zygomaturinae from the Late Pleistocene of Irian Jaya, New Guinea.

Each of the Bakugan are associated with a different element ranging from Pyrus (the attribute of fire), Subterra (the attribute of earth), Haos (the attribute of light), Darkus (the attribute of darkness), Aquos (the attribute of water), and Ventus (the attribute of wind).\n\nBattle Brawlers Bakugan\nThe following Bakugan are owned by the Battle Brawlers:\n\n\"Drago (Pyrus Dragonoid)\" \n\nThe Bakugan main protagonist in the series (and also main protagonist of series alongside Dan), and also Dan's partner who resembles a dragon. Drago is the leader of the Bakugan with strong convictions and morals, and is arguably the most powerful of all the bakugan. Together with Dan, they set out to defeat the Doom Beings, and rebuild the Perfect Core of Vestroia. He has the ability to radiate intense heat in battle dissolving everything around him. He is equipped with high intelligence. He is limited in battle mobility, but compensates for it through powerful strikes. He is able to infinitely evolve on his own and with every evolution it makes him stronger and it brings him one step closer to the Perfect Core.\n\n Delta Dragonoid II\n Drago's first evolution during Dan, Runo, and Marucho's battle against Julio, Klaus, and Chan Lee in Drago's On Fire. He fought against Dual Hydranoid, and lost, sending him to the Doom Dimension. In the Doom Dimension he battled Apollonir, after defeating him, he had to defeat Shun, Julie, Runo, and Marucho. He has three sleek horns and a hard plated armor in ball mode with chrome rings. He has an extra set of wings and a pitchfork tail.\n\n Ultimate Dragonoid\n Drago's second evolution when he defeated Storm Skyress. He has markings on his wings, which are now split, and he also has two horns that are merged. He was also used to defeat Alpha Hydranoid.\n\n Infinity Dragonoid\n Drago's third evolution (as an ultimate Bakugan) when he absorbed the Infinity Core from Wavern. He used it to absorb the Silent Core from Naga, becoming the Perfect Dragonoid completely, and later transforming himself into Vestroia's core.\n\n Neo Dragonoid \n Drago's regeneration in New Vestroia, after the Ancient Soldiers separated him from the Perfect Core in Invasion of the Vestals. Although he is weaker than his previous form, he still is one of the strongest bakugan. He still has a connection to the Core, and can gain new abilities from it during emergencies. When Dan lost his battle to Spectra and Helios, he also lost Drago and because of his forced defection, his color change from a pure red to mixture of red and black (turning him into a dark and corrupted Hex Dragonoid). Drago has now also lost all his free will in this form and his pupils have been erased. Drago gained the ability to change into any chosen attribute at the cost of his physical health. NOTE: As Drago has a portion from Vestroia's Core, he can evolve more of four times than in the first season.\n\n Cross Dragonoid\n Drago's next evolution when he inherits the Pyrus attribute energy from Apollonir in Six Degrees of Destruction, sadly Apollonir died. He lost the Pyrus energy when he, Helios, and Wilda lost a battle against Farbros and Dryoid.\n\n Helix Dragonoid\n Drago's next evolution when he absorbed the 6 Attribute energies from the BT System in Exodus. This evolution also marks the first anthropomorphic design of Drago. He can now combine with Battle Gear (JetKor), and his Dragon Hummer abilities gives him super speed. His Battle Gear is JetKor, a dual cannon blaster which can shoot an energy blast and defeat opponents. A lock on beam from the green lens freezes the opponent before the blaster attacks. It combines the two blaster beams into one enormous blast. It was used by Dan to combine with Drago in Fusion Confusion. The finished version was shown in episode 46. Unlike Helios' Battle Gear, it was made using Drago's own DNA so that it'd be more organic in nature, due to Drago's hatred of mechanical Bakugan and not wanting to become a cyborg like Helios. Because of this, JetKor acts like a part of Drago's own body when he uses it.\n\n Lumino Dragonoid\n Drago's next evolution in Gundalian Invaders. He evolved in, when Neo Ziperator gave him the Element in The Element. He has four wings and a tail with a giant X shape on it. Curiously his body looks like an amalgamation between his previous forms Cross and Helix. This marks the quickest time Drago has evolved in any of the series. His second Battle Gear is Explosix Gear (Cross Buster), similar to the JetKor with the only differences being the appearance of the cannons and its expansion to cover Drago's new wings. From this on, he also started to use two Mobile Assault Vehicles: Raytheus, a large motorcycle like hover vehicle with a laser mounted in front, and Jakalier, a resemblance to the ocelot's glider with the only difference being Dan being able to ride inside of it.\n\n Blitz Dragonoid\n Drago's next evolution when Dragonoid Colossus evolves him as a reward for defeating him in Genesis. He now has armor covering his front body and has a set of wings again, but bigger than his previous version's wing, Lumino Dragonoid. He is also able to combine with Dragonoid Colossus respectively. His third Battle is Axator Gear, given from Dragonoid Collossus. In this form, he represents the original Dragonoid who banished the Nonets to the Doom Dimension.\n\n Titanium Dragonoid\n Drago's next evolution, when Code Eve rewarded him for defeating Barodius and Dharak in Destiny Revealed. His Mechtogan is Zenthon and his Mechtogan Titan is Zenthon Titan. His BakuNano is Sonicannon, while his Mobile Assault Vehicles are the motorbike Zoompha and surfboard-like Rapilator.

His razor sharp wings and infamous horn give him tenacious attack when he leaps into battle. Only the bravest opponents can measure up to the combined ruthlesness and courage of Fusion Dragonoid. Fused with Reptak, he becomes Aeroblitz. His Battle Suit is Defendtrix.\n\n Maxus Dragonoid / Maxus Cross Dragonoid\n Neo Dragonoid's / Cross Dragonoid's transformation when combined with the six mechanical Bakugan Traps Brachium, Grafias, Dark Hound, Grakas Hound, Spitarm, and Spyderfencer.\n\nSkyress \n\nSkyress is Shun's guardian Bakugan that resembles a phoenix. She possesses the ultimate ability to resurrect herself. Her Impressive vision scours the horizon. She has gigantic wingspan and numerous long tails with bladed feathers at its tip. She is noble with a chivalrous spirit and fair in battle. Shun received Skyress as a gift from his sick mother right before she fell into a coma (in the English version; in the Japanese, she died).\n\n Storm Skyress\n Storm Skyress evolved from Skyress when Shun met an illusionary girl he realized was his mother in the past. Because of him missing his mother, he wanted to stay with her so that she wouldn't get ill like she did, realized he could not live alone with an illusionary form of his younger mother and his friends were depending on him. She is a larger, stronger version of Skyress with a colossal wingspan and a blade-tipped tail.

He can also fly high into the air and nosedive directly into his opponents to eliminate them.\n\n Master Ingram\n \n Ingram's evolution after gaining Oberus' elemental energy in Six Degrees of Destruction.

Its Baku Sky Raider Combination with Skytress and Oberum is Magmafury\n\nPreyas \n\nPreyas is a chameleon-like Bakugan with strong loyalty to Marucho. His greatest strength is that Preyas can change his molecular structure allowing him to turn to Darkus or Subterra. Even though he has a menacing appearance, he is shy and comical.

Preyas reappears in Return to New Vestroia.and in mechtanium surge when dan and drago go to New Vestroia and start training on an island they meet him and his student. In Blast From the Past, he was killed by Mechtavius Destroyer, but was resurrected when the Brawlers went back in time to stop Mechtavius Destroyer from destroying the universe.\n\n Preyas Angelo & Preyas Diablo\n \n Instead of evolving, Preyas regurgitated a mutated version of himself. The second Preyas has a split personality, one side is hotheaded and extremely rude, and the other is peaceful and overly polite. The rude side looks like demon version of Preyas and is a pyrus/aquos hybrid, called Preyas Diablo (demon); the polite side looks like an angel version of Preyas and is a haos/aquos hybrid, called Preyas Angelo (angel).

This one-headed Hydra-like Bakugan has very strong armor, a dragon-like face, spines all over its body, and a sharp flail for a tail. Its mobility is extremely slow, but can battle all species with its extremely powerful and forceful strikes. Hydranoid is a mercilessly cruel and unforgiving monster, not to mention extremely violent and arrogant that feeds off the power of Bakugan sent to the Doom Dimension by Masqerade. Like his old nemesis (now close friend) Drago, Hydranoid can evolve into a more powerful monster.\n\n Dual Hydranoid\n Hydranoid's first evolution with two heads. Hydranoid now also has two tails.

She wears a long, flowing robes and protects herself with the harp she carries. Sirenoid is mostly based on Sirens that lure in sailors by looks or by any devious way like how Sirenoid uses a harp. She is in love with her master Klaus Von Hertzon, and when she is living in Vestal, she lives in the fish tank of Klaus' office, albeit in her open Bakugan sphere form. This is referencing the fact that she is an Aquos Bakugan.\n\nFourtress \n\nA Bakugan that resembles an Asura and is Chan Lee's Guardian Bakugan. He is a warrior bakugan that has three faces and four arms giving him an extra edge in battle. Fortress faces are the face of rage/phase glare (attack), the face of sadness/phase breaker (defense), the face of joy/phase driver (power-up), and the face of enlightenment (enlightenment is never shown as an ability, but is the back face in ball form and is the starting face for when Fortress appears). He became more powerful in New Vestroia.\n\nTentaclear \nJulio's Guardian Bakugan. A Bakugan resembles a floating eye with tentacles on the side. Tentacular is unable to speak, perhaps because of his lack of a mouth. This proves to be a bad thing for Julio Santana because Harpus was making fun of him and Tentaclear couldn't speak for either side.\n\nHarpus \n\nKomba's Guardian who resembles a Harpy.

She uses the ultimate Ventus ability card, Turmoil, to boost her power level of 500 Gs to 700 Gs but can only defeat one Bakugan in return for this massive power boost.

It, like a regular Chamelia, has the ability to copy an opponent's Bakugan and their ability cards. It was deleting people's memories of their Bakugan, and caused many people, including Dan, Shun, and Julie, to forget that their Bakugan could talk. It also completely wiped out many Bakugan's memories, causing the Bakugan affected to be unable to speak.

Amazon ends up winning the battle when Dan and Drago pass out from another vision of Mag Mel and Razenoid. Preyas, clearly concerned that something is wrong with Drago, leaves with Amazon, letting Drago rest. When Dan tries to explain to him about Drago's powers, Amazon does not seem to care about holding back and what he would do if he had Drago's power. Later, he and Dan rush to find Drago when Dan senses an evil presence in New Vestroia. He gets scared easily when he sees Drago out of control. Later, he and Preyas hold off Venexus until Zenthon makes the save. He comments later on how awesome and powerful Dan and Drago are when battling together.

Baptiste Planckaert was the defending champion. He was not succeeded as the organisers decided not to keep the overall standings due to the large number of cancelled races as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nEvents\nWith respect to the previous season the event in Halle\u2013Ingooigem was dropped due to the organisers of this race focusing on the organisation of the 2020 Belgian National Road race championships. As a result the number of events dropped from eight to seven, although the late cancellation of the Grote Prijs Jean-Pierre Monser\u00e9 due to storms in 2019 resulted in just seven races to be held that year as well. Eventually only two races were held as only the Grote Prijs Jean-Pierre Monser\u00e9 was completed before the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, thereafter all other races got cancelled with the exception of Dwars door het Hageland which was rescheduled from 17 June 2020 to 15 August 2020.\n\nRace results\n\nGrote Prijs Jean-Pierre Monser\u00e9\n\nDwars door het Hageland\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n  Official website\n\nBelgian Road Cycling Cup\nBelgian Road Cycling Cup\nRoad Cycling Cup\nBelgian Road Cycling Cup, 2020", "\"Teach Your Children\" is a song written by Graham Nash in 1968 when he was a member of the Hollies. Although it was never recorded by that group in a studio, the Hollies did record it live in 1983. After the song was initially recorded for the album Crosby, Stills & Nash in 1969, a much more enhanced version of the song was recorded for the album D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu by Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, released in 1970. As a single, the song peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts that year.  On the Easy Listening chart, it peaked at No. 28.  In Canada, \"Teach Your Children\" reached No. 8. Reviewing the song, Cash Box commented on the \"incredible soft harmony luster\" and \"delicately composed material.\" Stephen Stills gave the song its \"country swing\", replacing the \"Henry VIII\" style of Nash's original demo.\n\nNash, who is also an accomplished photographer and collector of photographs, associated the song's message with a famous 1962 photo by Diane Arbus, Child with Toy Hand Grenade in Central Park, shortly after writing his song. The image, which depicts a child with an angry expression holding the toy weapon, prompted Nash to reflect on the societal implications of messages given to children about war and other issues.\n\nThe recording features Jerry Garcia on pedal steel guitar. Garcia taught himself how to play the instrument during his tenure with the New Riders of the Purple Sage. He told Lon Goddard of the British music newspaper Record Mirror in an interview that he recorded a series of pieces on the steel guitar and spliced them together in the studio to create the backing and solo.

The March took place of November 3, 2012. \n\nCo-organized by Michael Bellavia and Chris Mecham, the march was inspired by the comments of Presidential hopeful Mitt Romney during his 2012 presidential debate with Barack Obama. Romney promised to end funding for public broadcasting, saying during the debate that he would stop the federal subsidy to PBS. In particular, Romney added, \"I like PBS, I love Big Bird.\"  Bellavia and Mecham viewed Romney's threat as a straw man argument on the issue of the Federal budget and a dog whistle to ultra-conservatives meant to convey his position on social issues.\n\nThe 2012 Million Puppet March, which drew some 1500 participants, received recognition from Record Setter as the largest puppet march. Participants included Bread and Puppet Theater, the makers of the I Am Big Bird: The Caroll Spinney Story documentary that featured the original performer of Sesame Street characters Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch, Beale Street Puppets, the cast of STUFT, and Craig Aaron, executive director of Free Press.\n\nThe organizers of the March continue to support public media with ongoing education and advocacy efforts around puppetry with other parades and mobilizations around the country including Santa Monica, California, and Denver.\n\nSee also\n List of protest marches on Washington, D.C.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Million Puppet March\n2012 protests\nNovember 2012 events in the United States\nProtest marches in Washington, D.C.\nPuppetry organizations\nAdvocacy groups in the United States\n2012 in Washington, D.C.\n2012 United States presidential election\nPublic broadcasting in the United States", "The May 1909 Barcelona City Council election was held on Sunday, 2 May 1909, to elect half of the Barcelona City Council. 28 out of 50 seats were up for election (3 were vacant seats).\n\nElectoral system\nThe number of seats of each council was determined by the population count, according to the 1877 Municipal Law.

Her work focuses on qualitative psychology and critical psychology, and her background and training is in the fields of women studies, feminist psychology, LGBTQ psychology, and qualitative methods. She is particularly known for her ongoing collaboration with Professor Virginia Braun around qualitative methods. Braun and Clarke developed a widely cited approach to thematic analysis in 2006 and have published extensively around thematic analysis since then. They have also collaborated on an award-winning qualitative research textbook and more recently have published around the qualitative story completion method with the Story Completion Research Group.\n\nBiography\n\nHigher Education \nVictoria Clarke completed an undergraduate degree in psychology at Brunel University; she graduated in July 1997. After graduation, Clarke started a PhD in the Department of Social Sciences at Loughborough University supervised by Professor Celia Kitzinger (and later Professor Jonathan Potter and Professor Sue Wilkinson). Her PhD - in women's studies and psychology - focused on lesbian and gay parenting. This research further advanced the intersection between queer psychology and qualitative methods - she explored the social construction of LGBT parenting from both a queer studies and critical psychological perspective. Clarke graduated from Loughborough in July 2002. Lastly, Clarke got her postgraduate certificate in higher education at University of the West England, Bristol, graduating in July 2004.\n\nCareer \nBetween October 1997 and March 2002, Clarke was a PhD student in the Department of Social Sciences at Loughborough University. Her PhD research explored the social construction of lesbian and gay parenting - in psychology and mainstream media. She published papers on television talk show debates about same-sex parenting, on arguments used by opponents of same-sex parenting to justify their opposition to equality for lesbian and gay families and arguments about children's need for male role models and 'concerns' about homophobic bullying. She also published several papers critically exploring the representation of same-sex parenting in psychological research - exploring themes of sameness and difference, the rhetoric of pseudoscience and constructions of lesbians as parents in psychological literature from 1886\u20132006.\n\nAfter completing her PhD at Loughborough University, Clarke worked with Dr Carole Burgoyne and Professor Janet Reibstein, as a Research Fellow at the University of Exeter. The project - funded by the Lord Chancellor's Department - focused on money management in first time heterosexual marriage.\n\nShe joined the University of the West of England as a lecturer in Social Psychology in 2003. Currently Clarke is an Associate Professor in Qualitative and Critical Psychology at the University of the West England, Bristol. Her research and teaching is centered around qualitative methods, queer psychology, human sexuality and gender studies.\n\nSelected works\n\nBooks\n\nVirginia Braun and Victoria Clarke. (2021).

The festival began in 2009 and spans about ten days during which thousands of dogs are reportedly consumed. The festival has drawn criticism internationally.\n\nBackground\nThe festival is celebrated annually in Yulin, Guangxi, China, during the summer solstice in June, by eating dog meat and lychees. Early on, it was reported that roughly 10,000 dogs had been consumed for each annual occurrence of the festival. This number is estimated by some to have decreased to 1,000 in 2015.\n\nConcerns\n\nAnimal cruelty \nThe festival organizers claim that the dogs are killed humanely and that \"eating dog is no different from eating pork or beef\". Animal rights activists and campaigners, however, claim that the animals are treated cruelly. Some media outlets have reported that dogs are intentionally tortured or boiled alive to improve the taste of their meat. Several other reports have stated that since 2015 there has been little evidence for those allegations.\n\nDog theft \nA 2015 report by Animals Asia Foundation stated that most dogs that are consumed are strays or stolen pets. Approximately 70% of rural villages surveyed in China have suffered mysterious dog losses.\n\nChanges in 2020 \nAmidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic of China officially declared that dogs are companions, and should not be treated as livestock, thereby banning their commercial slaughter and sale.\n\nDuring February, the city of Yulin made a statement to put a ban to the dog consumption market, stating that as an effort to combat coronavirus. However, the festival resumed on 21 June 2020 in defiance of the government campaign, although reportedly with a dwindling number of attendees.\n\nReactions\n\nDomestic \n\nIn 2016, 1,000 dogs were rescued from the festival; the previous week 34 animals (21 dogs, eight puppies, and five cats and kittens) were rescued from a slaughter facility in Yulin by Humane Society International. Another 1,000 dogs were saved by Chinese activists in 2017.\n\nMillions of Chinese in 2016 voted in support of a legislative proposal by Zhen Xiaohe, a deputy to the National People's Congress of China, to ban the dog meat trade. A petition in China at the very same year with 11 million signatures garnered calling to end the festival was presented to Yulin government offices in Beijing. Reports from 2014 and 2016 have also suggested that the majority of Chinese both on and offline disapprove of the festival. Chinese celebrities such as Fan Bingbing, Chen Kun, Sun Li and Yang Mi have also publicly expressed a distaste for the event.\n\nIn 2017, over 1,300 dogs were rescued by activists. After a tip, a truck transporting the dogs was blocked. Police confirmed that the majority of the dogs were stolen and not allowed for consumption, allowing volunteers to rescue the dogs. Up to 40% of the dogs also carried infectious diseases.\n\nState media \nIn a 2014 statement released to Xinhua, Yulin's local government denies any official involvement or endorsement of the festival itself, and describes the event as a local custom observed by \"a small percentage\" of Yulin's residents. They attribute the branding of the event to local businesses and residents.\n\nAn editorial published by the People's Daily expressed the view that while activists understand dogs as \"companion animals\", neither the Chinese legal system nor the current Chinese public recognizes them with this special status. While noting the \"duality\" of dogs as both companions and food items, the editorial urges restraint in handling the issue and calls mutual understanding from both organizers and activists in reaching a respectful compromise.\n\nMedia campaigns \nCampaigns have had an impact on spreading awareness of the festival around the globe. Many activists and public figures take to Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and have created hashtags such as \"#stopyulinforever\", \"#stopyulin2015\", \"#stopyulin2016\", and \"#stopyulin2020\" to spread the word. Due in part to social media campaigns both in and outside of China, the number of dogs slaughtered has apparently decreased since 2013 to 1,000 in 2016, although the festival is still being held in 2021.\n\nNews \nAmidst reporting on clashes between Chinese animal advocates and dog meat traders, The New York Times interviewed professor Peter J. Li of the University of Houston\u2013Downtown on his views of the allegations from dog meat traders that local activists had introduced a harmful Western ideology into China. Li replied that the opposition to eating dog meat at the festival began with the Chinese, as \"the bond between companion animals and humans is not Western. It's a transcultural phenomenon\".\n\nThe director of Animal Protection and Crisis Response for Humane Society International explained in an article on CNN the reasons for his opposition to the festival and called on the Yulin government to cancel the festival.\n\nIn 2016, an article written by the BBC noted that the festival began amid widespread criticism, saying, \"Activists say the event is cruel, and this year a petition calling for it to be banned collected 11 million signatures.\"\n\nAn article in The Guardian by Jill Robinson said that the dog meat trade is \"steeped in illegality\" and the reason why dogs are special and deserve kind treatment is because \"they are friends and helpers of humankind.\" Another article by Julian Baggini that was published in the same news outlet said that what should be most appalling about the festival \"is not which particular animal is being killed, but that too many animals in the West are treated nearly or just as cruelly\" and that \"vegans are the only group who can oppose the festival without any fear of hypocrisy\".\n\nAn article in The Independent encouraged protests against the festival but also compared the festival with the 1.9 million animals \"brutally slaughtered\" in the UK every month and noted that \"the western distinction between dogs and farm animals is completely arbitrary\". An article in The Diamondback further questioned whether the large amount of criticism towards the festival was truly due to animal rights instead of cultural relativism, arguing that chickens being \"drowned alive in scalding tanks\" or left to \"freeze to death in slaughterhouse trucks\" was another cruel practice in the US that had garnered less attention.\nIn 2021 a small poodle covered in maggots was rescued from a truck heading to the Festival by campaign group NoToDogMeat.\n\nSocial media \nThe outrage on social media over the 2014 festival was unprecedented.\n\nIn June 2015, an online petition against the festival was started in the United Kingdom, gathering over 4 million signatures. In 2016 Humane Society International organised a petition in opposition to the dog eating festival which was signed by 11 million people worldwide.\n\nA 2016 survey conducted by Chinese polling company Horizon, found that 64% of Chinese citizens want to see an end to the Yulin festival.\n\nInternational \nIn 2015, actor and comedian Ricky Gervais brought attention to the issue by urging people to get behind Humane Society International\u2019s campaign to shut down China\u2019s dog and cat meat trade, including the infamous Yulin dog meat festival.  \n\nU.S. Representative Alcee Hastings introduced, alongside 27 original cosponsors, a bipartisan resolution (House Resolution 752) in 2016 which condemned the annual festival in Yulin and called on the Chinese government to prohibit the dog meat trade outright. The resolution was supported by the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society Legislative Fund, and Humane Society International. In 2017, Hastings reintroduced, alongside 49 original co-sponsors, his 2016 bipartisan resolution through House Resolution 30.\n\nThe festival has also been condemned in an Early Day Motion signed by Jeremy Corbyn, former leader of the UK Labour Party.\n\nCelebrities including Joaquin Phoenix, Matt Damon, Sia, Bill Maher, Lisa Vanderpump, Ricky Gervais, George Lopez, Ian Somerhalder, Leona Lewis, Lori Alan, Tom Kenny, Rob Zombie and Anushka Sharma have publicly denounced the festival.\n\nSee also \n\n \n Animal welfare and rights in China\n Pinikpikan\n Gadhimai festival\n Kots Kaal Pato\n Running of the bulls\n\nReferences\n\nAnimal cruelty incidents\nAnnual events in China\nAnimal festival or ritual\nAnimal sacrifice\nAnimal welfare and rights in China\nCruelty to animals\nDog meat\nDogs\nFestivals in China\nFolk festivals in China\nGuangxi\nJune events\nSummer festivals\nSummer events in China\n2009 establishments in China", "Harris Associates L.P. is a Chicago-based investment company that manages $86 billion in assets as of September 30, 2022.

The album features eleven new songs to focus on \"empty hearts, empty nests, lost paths, lost lives, and all the reckoning that brings about the end of things, and the beginnings of something else. [The] songs are about reckoning on a personal level and reckoning on a social level,\" as stated by Michael Timmins.\n\nAlbum development \nThe Junkies last recorded an album together in 2012, the final album of their Nomad series. Since then they worked on different projects, such as The Kennedy Suite, and other things, and just remained busy. According to Michael Timmins, they had released plenty of albums, and in the current business climate, the reasoning for releasing more music became more for the art than other factors. One \"can get that part of one's personality massaged by doing live shows and small projects. A whole album is a lot of work. You sort of begin to think, 'Does anybody care anymore?' But it's hard for us to think about singles or whatever format people are purporting to be the new way of putting out music. So if we're going to record, for us, it's going to be an album.\"\n\nTimmins accumulated songs that reached into the personal and political sides, songs that try to figure out where people are headed in the world, where society is heading, what the end results may look like. According to Michael Timmns, \"There's a lot of pressures and a lot of crumbling of institutions, very little foundation to put one's feet on again, especially at an older age. You sort of expect things to be there and realize, 'My God, what I thought was a standard, whether it be an institution or a way of dealing with people in our society, is disappearing.'\". After accumulating the songs, it was time to shape them artistically, and the Junkies went to their home studio to hammer All That Reckoning into shape. The poetry of William Blake provided inspiration for some of the songs, specifically, \"The Angel\" inspired \"Mountain Stream\", and \"The Tyger\" inspired \"Missing Children\". The music that Michael Timmins produces has a lot of input from the band these days. The songwriting part is Michael, a guitar, and solitude. After creating the lyrics, Michael mixes in the other band members voices and instruments to create the Junkie sound. Anton would display some elaborate bass lines, which Michael would write songs around, and then Margo and Peter would add her voice and his drums and fill out the songs.  Then the songs would be played live before recording them, to clean up and round off the songs.\n\nMichael Timmins goal when writing the album was to not just write about the current politics of the day, because that risks becoming irrelevant a few years later. The album has an internal dialogue, showing a reflection of the exterior world on the interior world and vice versa. In addition, the Junkies aimed to avoid a hard viewpoint, to not push a view, so as to include a large spectrum of viewpoints as held by their audience. One example of the album's internal and external voice is the two versions of the album's title track  \"All That Reckoning Part 1\" and \"All That Reckoning Part 2\", with the first part displaying an unspoken dread of a relationship in crisis, and the second part a jagged psychedelic song full of anger. According to Michael Timmins, \"[The songs] kind of fed into the title \u2014 the way we relate to each other, and the personal and the social \u2014 so it made sense in a high-concept way. But in a very basic way, we just liked the way both of them put the song across.\"\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel \nCowboy Junkies\nMargo Timmins \u2013 vocals\nMichael Timmins \u2013 guitar, ukulele\nAlan Anton \u2013 bass, keyboards\nPeter Timmins \u2013 drums, percussion\n\nAdditional musicians\nBill Dillon \u2013 guitar solo (track 1, 10), backwards guitar (track 6, 9), lead guitar (track 7)\nAaron Goldstein \u2013 lead guitar (track 1, 5, 10), leslie guitar (track 2)\nJesse O'Brien \u2013 Organ (track 2, 9), piano (track 2\u20134, 9)\nJames McKie \u2013 Fiddle (track 4, 7, 9)\n\nProduction\nMichael Timmins \u2013 producer, recorder, mixed by\nAlan Anton \u2013 co-producer\nPeter J.

He was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2007, and has also played for the Carolina Panthers, the Kansas City Chiefs, and the Miami Dolphins. He played college football at UCLA and Oregon State.\n\nEarly years\nAfter playing youth football for six years with Palmdale Falcons Youth Football, Moore attended William S. Hart High School in Santa Clarita, California.\n\nAs a junior, Moore lettered in football while playing as a safety, earning All-CIF acclaim with 80 tackles and 10 interceptions on the season.\n\nMoore lettered again during his senior year playing as Hart High School's starting quarterback. Moore led his team to a 13\u20130 record, culminating in a 42\u201313 win over Valencia in the CIF-Southern Section Division III title game. In the sectional, division title game, Moore completed 14 of 18 passes for 277 yards and four touchdowns and ran 15 times for 95 yards and one score. On the year, he completed 234 of 353 (66.3%) passes for 3,334 yards and 33 touchdowns and ran for 415 yards and seven scores. Moore was named the CIF-SS Division III Offensive Player of the Year. He was named First-team All-State and First-team All-CIF SS. He was selected to play in the 2002 North-South Shrine All-Star game.\n\nMoore ended his senior season as one of the top-rated quarterbacks in the nation. He was ranked No. 8 by Scout.com and No. 11 by Rivals.com. SuperPrep rated him as the No. 8 quarterback in the nation and named him the FarWest Offensive Player of the Year. Max Emfinger named him to his All-America team and ranked him as a four-star prospect and the No. 17 quarterback prospect. PacWest Football rated Moore a four-star rating and rated him the No. 6 quarterback in the West and No. 9 in the nation. PrepStar named Moore to the All-American team and rated him the No. 5 quarterback in the West. He was named member of the Tacoma News Tribune Western 100, the Las Vegas Sun Super 11 second-team, the Los Angeles Times All-Star Team, and the First-team L.A. Times All-San Fernando Valley, which selected him as the region Player of the Year.\n\nMoore lettered twice in baseball playing shortstop and third base.\n\nCollege career\n\n2002\nMoore began his college football career at UCLA. He was slated to redshirt, but was pressed into duty due to injuries to Cory Paus and Drew Olson against Cal. He appeared in six games as a true freshman, becoming the first Bruins' true-freshman quarterback to start since Cade McNown. The Bruins defeated Stanford in Moore's debut, making him the first true-freshman QB in his first game to lead UCLA to victory. He led the team to seven scoring drives against the Cardinals. He saw action against Arizona, USC, Washington State, and New Mexico in the Las Vegas Bowl as a reserve. Moore was 7 for 11 for 64 yards and one touchdown in the annual rivalry game against USC. For the season he completed 33 of 62 passes for 412 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions.\n\n2003\nMoore started four of the eight games he appeared in at UCLA. He threw for 555 yards, two touchdowns, and six interceptions as a sophomore, completing 52 of 103 passes. He started the season opener against Colorado, but suffered a leg injury that sidelined him for the next three games. He had difficulty regaining the starting job with just eight pass attempts over the next three games. He moved back in front of Olson on the depth chart for the Oct 26 game at the Rose Bowl against Arizona State, passing for 190 yards and a touchdown in UCLA's 20\u201313 win. He also started the team's next two games against Stanford and Washington State.\nAt the end of the season, Moore transferred from UCLA. (LA Times, December 5, 2003).\n\n2004\nMoore did not play in 2004 while attending the College of the Canyons in Santa Clarita, California. Although he had not played baseball since high school, he was selected in the 22nd round of the 2004 MLB draft by the Los Angeles Angels after scouts saw him play in a Southern California semi-pro baseball league and invited him to private workouts with the team.\n\n2005\nAlthough he also strongly considered Colorado State, Moore enrolled at Oregon State in January 2005 and participated in spring training with the team. Head coach Mike Riley announced him as the leader on the depth chart entering the 2005 season. He finished the season with 2,711 yards passing, the ninth-highest total for a single season at OSU. His .594 completion percentage was third among the 20-best single season yardage performances in school history. Moore injured his right knee in the second quarter of the 10th game of the season against Stanford and missed the remainder of the year. His 271.1 yards passing per game was second in the Pac-10, trailing only USC's Matt Leinart (293.5). Making yet another record-breaking debut, he threw for 367 yards in the season opener against Portland State, the most ever by a Beaver quarterback in his first start. Moore threw for a career-high 436 yards against Arizona, had 317 yards at Louisville, and 311 against Arizona State. He hit Mike Hass on a 63-yard touchdown strike against Washington State that gave OSU the lead 37\u201333 after the team trailed 30\u201313 late in the second quarter. He also had two 58-yard passes\u2014one to Anthony Wheat-Brown in the team's upset of No. 18 California in Berkeley and the other one week later (again to Hass) in his return to the Rose Bowl.\n\n2006\nMoore started all 14 games for the Beavers and was an All-Pac-10 honorable mention leading the Beavers to a 10-win season capped off by a Sun Bowl victory against Mizzou. After a 2\u20133 start, Moore and coach Mike Riley received a great deal of criticism from fans. Both found redemption after winning the next 8 of 9 games. This streak included a win over #3 ranked USC and a Civil War win at home. On the season, Moore completed 229 of 378 passes for 3,022 yards and 18 touchdowns with seven interceptions. He set an Oregon State record for the most consecutive pass attempts without an interception with 183 before having that streak end in the Sun Bowl.  He was named MVP of the Sun Bowl after throwing for 356 yards and four touchdowns and rushing for one touchdown. The 4 passing TDs were a Sun Bowl record. It was the second-highest scoring game in the Sun Bowl's 73-year history. He was 5-for-7 for 55 yards on the winning drive, setting up a 2-point conversion to put the Beavers up 39\u201338 with 22 seconds left to play.\n\nProfessional career\n\nDallas Cowboys\nMoore was not selected in the 2007 NFL Draft, but he was courted by the Dallas Cowboys and the Carolina Panthers, among other teams. Eventually, Moore signed as an undrafted free agent with the Dallas Cowboys. On signing with Dallas, Moore stated, \"They had two quarterbacks on the roster; it was the Cowboys,\" adding \"seemed like an easy choice to me at the time.\"\n\nDuring the preseason, Moore completed 21 of 29 pass attempts for 182 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, while also logging a 100.1 quarterback rating. On September 1, the Cowboys waived Moore during their final preseason cuts. The Cowboys intended to sign Moore to their practice squad had he passed through waivers. However, the following day, he was claimed off waivers by the Carolina Panthers.\n\nCarolina Panthers\n\n2007 season\nAfter being signed by the Panthers, Moore was listed as the third-string quarterback behind veterans Jake Delhomme and David Carr. Delhomme suffered a strained right elbow injury, early in the season, during a game against the Atlanta Falcons. Moore saw his first regular season action on October 7, 2007, against the New Orleans Saints, during the Panthers' 5th game of the season. Near the end of the first quarter, Moore entered the game after Carr suffered a back injury, due to a sack. Moore's first NFL completion was a 43-yard pass to Keary Colbert; his playing time was brief as Carr returned to the field for the game's second half. The following day, Delhomme determined it would be best to undergo season-ending ligament-replacement surgery for his elbow injury. As a result of Delhomme's season-ending surgery and Carr's back injury, the Panthers signed veteran quarterback Vinny Testaverde to their roster.\n\nMoore later briefly relieved Carr towards the end of a week 9 game against the Tennessee Titans. Moore also entered the Panthers' week 12 loss to the Saints, after Carr's ineffective performance. A balky back kept Testaverde from starting this game, and the Panthers' head coach John Fox stated that if healthy enough, Testaverde would start the next game over both Carr and Moore.\n\nAfter six brief appearances during the season, Moore started his first NFL game on December 16, 2007, against the Seattle Seahawks; Testaverde was ruled unable to play, because of \"general soreness.\" He led the Panthers to victory against the Seahawks while completing 19 of 27 passes for 208 yards without a turnover. The following week, the Panthers suffered a loss against the Cowboys, while Moore had 15 completions on 28 pass attempts for 182 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. During the game, Steve Smith hauled in Moore's first NFL touchdown pass. The Panthers ended the season with a road win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, in which Moore completed 15 of 24 pass attempts for 174 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. After these performances, Moore was named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month for December. Overall, in the 2007 season, Moore finished with 730 passing yards, three touchdowns, and five interceptions.\n\n2008 season\nMoore played in all four 2008 preseason games for the Panthers; during the final preseason game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Moore injured his leg. Moore was cleared to practice as two x-rays and an MRI revealed no broken bones. However, during a practice, Moore injured his leg, and an x-ray revealed a broken fibula. The Panthers' general manager Marty Hurney initially stated Moore would not be placed on injured reserve. Despite this, Moore was sidelined the entire 2008 season, and even spent the last 12 weeks of the season listed as inactive.\n\n2009 season\n\nMoore saw his first action of the 2009 season when backup quarterback Josh McCown was injured during the Panthers' week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Moore finished with 63 yards, one touchdown, and one interception. Moore also played briefly against the Arizona Cardinals, attempting one pass which was incomplete.\n\nAfter starter Jake Delhomme broke his finger in a week 12 loss to the New York Jets, Moore started against Tampa Bay on December 6, 2009, the following week. He completed 14 of 20 passes for 161 yards and an interception, en route to a 16\u20136 Panthers' victory. The following week, he completed 15 of 30 passes for 197 yards and a touchdown in a 20\u201310 loss to the New England Patriots.\n\nOn December 20 (in his 6th start) Moore had the best game of his career when he led the Panthers to a 26\u20137 upset victory over the Minnesota Vikings. In the victory he completed 21 of 33 passes for 299 yards, 3 touchdowns, and 0 interceptions, and improved to a career 4\u20132 as a starter. He drew praise from head coach John Fox and top receiver Steve Smith, who caught nine passes from Moore for 157 yards and a score.\n\nOn December 27 Moore completed 15 passes on 20 attempts for 171 yards, and for the second week in a row, three touchdowns and no interceptions, as Carolina beat the New York Giants 41\u20139. Moore had a career-high 139.8 passer rating. The victory came during the final game to be played in Giants Stadium and essentially eliminated the Giants from the playoffs. The Giants' home loss was their worst since 1998. Moore again drew praise from analysts, including Tony Dungy who said that Moore \"looked liked a pro-bowler\".\n\nMoore started the last game of the Panthers' season on January 3, 2010, as the Panthers beat the New Orleans Saints 23\u201310. The Saints, who were the No. 1 seed in the NFC, were handed their third loss of the season as they rested most of their starters. The game was the coldest home game in team history for the Panthers. Moore completed 14 passes on 23 attempts for 162 yards and a touchdown. The win improved the Panthers to .500 with an 8\u20138 record (4\u20131 while starting Moore) to finish the season.\n\nIn his five games as a starter for the 2009 season, Moore threw eight touchdown passes with one interception. The strong finish by Moore and the Panthers, combined with earlier poor play by Jake Delhomme, led to speculation that Moore would challenge, if not replace, Jake Delhomme's role as the starting quarterback for the 2010 season despite Delhomme's large contract. This turned out be the case as Delhomme was cut from the Panthers on March 4, 2010.\n\n2010 season\nMoore was declared the starter for the 2010 season after Delhomme's release. Despite this, the Carolina Panthers drafted rookie Jimmy Clausen with their second round pick (48th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft. Though Moore had clearly established himself as the Panthers' number one quarterback, he faced pressure for the starting job from Clausen, possibly resulting in his poor play throughout the rest of the season. Moore suffered a concussion during the season opener at the New York Giants, and he was benched the following week in a loss against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following poor play. On September 20, 2010, Moore was removed as the Panthers' starting quarterback in favor of rookie Jimmy Clausen, after throwing four interceptions in the first two games.\n\nAfter sitting out for three straight games, Moore was again declared the Panthers' starting quarterback on October 18, 2010, following poor play by Clausen. In his first game back as a starter against the San Francisco 49ers, Moore completed 28 passes on 41 attempts for 308 yards, two touchdowns and one interception, setting career highs in yards and completions.\n\nIn a week 9 loss to the New Orleans Saints, Moore injured his shoulder after a hit from Sedrick Ellis. He was placed on injured reserve by the Panthers, ending his season.\n\nMiami Dolphins\n\n2011 season\n\nMoore was signed by the Dolphins on July 28, 2011, to back up Chad Henne. He switched numbers, from 3 to 8. On October 2, 2011, Moore entered the game against the Chargers in the first quarter after Henne went down with a shoulder injury. He completed 17 of 26 passes for 167 yards and an interception, compiling a 67.3 quarterback rating. On November 6 he became the first Miami quarterback since Chad Pennington in 2008 to throw three touchdown passes in a game, in their 31\u20133 win over the Kansas City Chiefs.He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his game against the Chiefs.  He repeated that feat in week 11, blowing out the Bills 35\u20138, and had the highest QB rating of the week. Following the season, he was announced as the Dolphins' 2011 season MVP. Overall, Moore finished the 2011 season with 2,497 yards, 16 touchdowns, and nine interceptions.\n\n2012 season\nDuring the offseason, Moore was battling for the starting quarterback role against newly drafted Ryan Tannehill and newly signed David Garrard. Moore became the second-string quarterback. On November 28, 2012, in a week 8 game against the New York Jets, Moore went in for Tannehill after he left the game with injuries to his left knee and thigh. Moore went 11 for 19 on his passes with a touchdown, leading to a 30\u20139 victory over the Jets.\n\n2013 season\nOn March 8, 2013, Moore re-signed with the Dolphins, agreeing on a two-year deal to remain a backup for Tannehill. He did not see much action in the 2013 season. His lone appearance came against the Buffalo Bills, where he was 2-of-6 for 53 yards and two interceptions in a 19\u20130 loss.\n\n2014 season\nIn the 2014 season, Moore saw action in two games. On September 28, against the Oakland Raiders, he came into the end of the 38\u201314 victory in relief of Ryan Tannehill. On November 2, he was 2-of-4 for 21 yards in the 37\u20130 victory over the San Diego Chargers.\n\n2015 season\nIn the 2015 season, he only appeared in one game. In the 44\u201326 victory over the Houston Texans, he completed one pass for 14 yards and ran out the clock at the end of the game in relief of Tannehill.\n\n2016 season\nOn March 15, 2016, Moore re-signed with the Dolphins, agreeing on a two-year deal worth $3.5 million to remain a backup for Tannehill.\nOn December 11, 2016, during a week 14 game against the Arizona Cardinals, Moore saw his first action as quarterback for the season. He replaced Tannehill in the fourth quarter, after Tannehill was injured on a low hit by Cardinals' defensive end Calais Campbell. The injury would later be confirmed as a sprained left MCL and ACL. Moore led a game-winning field goal drive, highlighted by Moore's 29-yard pass to wide receiver Kenny Stills deep in the final quarter to put the Dolphins on the 3-yard line. After a couple of plays, Dolphins' kicker Andrew Franks kicked a 21-yard field goal in heavy rain to win the game 26\u201323, keeping the Dolphins' playoff hopes alive. He started the next game against the New York Jets, completing 12 of 18 passes for 236 yards and a career-high four touchdowns with one interception as the Dolphins beats the Jets by a score of 34\u201313, improving their record to 9\u20135 and clinching their first winning season since 2008. It was Moore's first start since 2011. With his performance, Moore was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.\n\nMoore was announced the starting quarterback for the Dolphins against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card Round of the 2017 National Football League playoffs as Tannehill did not appear to be fully recovered. This was Moore's first playoff game. The Dolphins lost 30\u201312 to the Steelers in Pittsburgh.\n\n2017 season\nDuring week 7 against the New York Jets, Moore entered the game after Jay Cutler suffered a chest injury in the third quarter. Moore finished with 188 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception as the Dolphins won by a score of 31\u201328. Due to Cutler's injury, Moore started the week 8 game against the Baltimore Ravens, throwing for 176 yards and 2 interceptions as the Dolphins lost by a score of 40\u20130. Both of his interceptions were returned for touchdowns. During the week 11 game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Cutler took a hit to the head on the final play of the first half and was relieved by Moore, who threw for 282 yards and 1 touchdown as the Dolphins lost by a score of 30\u201320. Due to Cutler being in the concussion protocol, Moore started the team's next game and finished with 215 passing yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions in the 35\u201317 loss.\n\nKansas City Chiefs\n\n2019 season\nMoore spent the 2018 season out of football, though he did receive offers to play. In 2019, he worked as a scout for the Miami Dolphins during the draft process. He had started working as an assistant coach for a high school football team when he signed with the Kansas City Chiefs on August 26, 2019, following an injury to backup quarterback Chad Henne.\n\nMoore took over as the Chiefs' quarterback after Patrick Mahomes injured his knee on October 17, 2019, in a week 7 game on Thursday Night Football against the Denver Broncos. Moore finished the game against the Broncos going 10-of-19 for 117 yards and a touchdown pass. The following week, Moore started in place of the injured Mahomes against the Green Bay Packers and had 267 passing yards and two touchdowns in the 31\u201324 loss. In week 9, against the Minnesota Vikings, he had 275 passing yards and a touchdown in the 26\u201323 victory. Moore's performance against the Vikings was his last significant action of the 2019 season as Mahomes returned from injury in week 10. Moore served as backup quarterback in the Chiefs' first Super Bowl appearance since Super Bowl IV in 1970, clinching the win against the San Francisco 49ers with a score of 31\u201320 in Super Bowl LIV.\n\n2020 season\nMoore re-signed with the Chiefs on July 10, 2020. He was released on September 5, 2020. He was signed to the practice squad the following day.

It breeds in South America.\n\nBetween April and June they prefer reed beds and will lay 6 to 10 creamy-pink eggs. As with swans and geese, both parents will rear the ducklings. A pair may bond long term. It lives on fresh water in small groups, and feeds primarily on vegetable matter such as seeds and aquatic plants.\n\nThe silver teal's range includes southern Bolivia, southern Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, South Georgia, South Sandwich Islands, and the Falkland Islands.  The southernmost birds migrate to southern Brazil in the winter.\n\nSilver teals are on the whole placid ducks but may be protective of eggs, young and females.\n\nDescription \nThey have a black cap that extends below the eyes, and a bluish bill with a yellow tip.  They also have a green speculum with a white border.\n\nThe Puna teal was previously regarded as a subspecies of this bird.

The screenplay written by Mary Loos, Mary C. McCall, Jr., and Richard Sale was based on characters created by Gwen Davenport. It follows on from Sitting Pretty (1948), and had a sequel, Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell (1951). The film focuses on prickly genius Lynn Belvedere (Clifton Webb) who enrolls in a major university with the intention of obtaining a four-year degree in only one year.\n\nPlot \nLynn Belvedere, though the successful author of a scandalous, best-selling book titled Hummingbird Hill (as described in Sitting Pretty), has not benefited financially, as he has had to fight many libel suits as a result. He has been awarded a literary prize from a foundation. One requirement for the $10,000 prize is that he be a college graduate.\n\nTo meet that requirement, Belvedere decides to enroll at Clemens University. The president of the university allows him to do so, on condition that he not do anything publicly detrimental to the institution. Belvedere intends to complete the four-year program in a single year, even though he has no formal education. He passes the entrance exams with flying colors because he is a self-taught genius.\n\nHe is assigned to share a dorm room with freshman Corny Whittaker and bossy sophomore Avery Brubaker. A fellow student who writes for the school paper, Ellen Baker, wants to interview him, but he declines.\n\nBelvedere gets a job as a food server at a sorority house from student job coordinator Bill Chase. Bill is interested in Ellen, and later at a dinner he introduces her to his mother, who is in charge of the sorority. Belvedere corrects the girls' behavior and etiquette at dinner.\n\nBelvedere is punished for shaving during \"Whisker Week\": he has to wear a fake beard until further notice. Ellen takes a photo of him in the beard for an article she is writing. The article includes quotes from Belvedere that displease the university greatly, even though Belvedere states they were not intended for publication and plans to sue Ellen and the university. Instead, Belvedere advises Ellen not to publish pure gossip in future and not to submit another, longer article to Look magazine.\n\nAs the relationship between Bill and Ellen deepens, she introduces him to her young son, Davy. She tells Bill that she is a war widow. He is taken aback, but after thinking it over, he decides he loves her, they reconcile, and become engaged.\n\nWhen Ellen gets a cool reception from Bill's mother, she believes that Belvedere has told Mrs. Chase about her son. She decides to send her article about Belvedere to the magazine after all. Bill pleads with her not to, but she refuses to listen. Belvedere tries to talk to her, but she will not let him in. He sneaks in through the window. The police find him in her apartment and arrest him, believing he is a Peeping Tom. Belvedere is released when Ellen drops the charges. He then arranges for her to make up with Bill.\n\nBelvedere not only completes his degree in one year, he is the class valedictorian. In the final scene, as the President of Clemens hands Belvedere his degree, he hands the president a rolled up magazine. He unrolls it to learn that it is a copy of Look ... with a photo of Mr. Belvedere receiving his degree on the cover and as the lead article. Belvedere then breaks the fourth wall and smiles knowingly at the audience.\n\nCast\n Clifton Webb as Lynn Belvedere\n Shirley Temple as Ellen Baker\n Tom Drake as Bill Chase\n Alan Young as Avery Brubaker\n Jessie Royce Landis as Mrs. Chase\n Kathleen Hughes as Kay Nelson\n Taylor Holmes as Dr. Gibbs, the dean of the university\n Alvin Greenman as Cornelius Whittaker\n Paul Harvey as Dr. Keating, the president of the university\n Barry Kelley as Police Sergeant Griggs\n Robert Patten as Joe Fisher\n Jeff Chandler as Pratt\n Kathleen Freeman as Gwendolyn (uncredited)\n\nProduction\nJeff Chandler has a small role.

It is the oldest and largest outdoor multi-breed horse show in the U.S. The event serves as a fundraiser for Bryn Mawr Hospital.\n\nDescription\nSince 1896, the Devon Horse Show is the oldest and largest outdoor multi-breed horse competition in the United States. The Annual Horse show and Country Fair promotes horsemanship and horse breeding for conformation, performance and speed. The original ideas and activities of the show have changed dramatically over the decades. The show attracts people from all over the world, as both competitors and spectators.\n\nHistory \nThe first horse show was held on July 2, 1896 as a one-day event held at the Devon Race track and Polo Grounds. The show consisted of thirty classes, the largest class having only ten entries. The fenced-in show ring was constructed on grass and the judges and officials sat in a gazebo in the center. Today, there is a fenced-in sand ring and there are at least five judges' booths or stands sitting on the outside of the main arena. The Devon Horse Show grounds hosts two main rings, the Dixon Oval and the Wheeler Ring. The Dixon Oval is the main arena surrounded by the grandstands with the famous gateway reading \"Where Champions Meet.\" The smaller Wheeler Ring hosts the more populous classes such as pony breeding classes, USEF Medal, Regular Pony Hunters, as well as Local Hunters.\n\nThe Devon Horse Show has in-hand, jumpers, hunters, carriages, and gaited events.\n\nDressage at Devon is also held on the Devon Horse Show grounds, taking place September 26 through the 30th.\n\nCause\n\nThe Devon Horse Show, instituted just 3 years after the opening of Bryn Mawr Hospital, serves as the hospital's largest fund-raising event, beginning in 1919. Since 1972, Devon has contributed over $100 million to Bryn Mawr Hospital, to support projects such as the Emergency Center, the Maternal-Fetal Medicine program and the Outpatient Diagnostic Center.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nDevon Horse Show Official Site\n\nEquestrian sports competitions in the United States\nShow jumping events\nTourist attractions in Chester County, Pennsylvania\nEquestrian sports in the United States\nSports competitions in Pennsylvania\n1896 establishments in Pennsylvania", "Sarah Chang (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 1980. december 10. \u2013) amerikai heged\u0171m\u0171v\u00e9sz.\n\nDiszkogr\u00e1fia \u00a0\n 1992 Debut\n 1993 Brahms; Tschaikowsky\n 1996 Eduard Lalo; Vieuxtemps\n 1997 Simply Sarah\n 1998 Sibelius; Mendelsohn-Barholdy\n 1999 Sweet Sorrow\n 2000 Karl Goldmark; G\u00fcrzenich-Orchester, (James Conlon)\n 2001 Fire and Ice\n 2002 Antonin Dvorak, P.

It was itself a product of a merger between First & Merchants Bank of Richmond and Virginia National Bankshares of Norfolk, both of which could trace back their history to the 1860s. In 1990, it was merged with Citizens & Southern National Bank to form C&S/Sovran Corp., which in turn merged with NCNB to form NationsBank which became Bank of America in 1998.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst & Merchants Bank\nRichmond had no bank after the federal government had revoked charters of banks whose loyalty was questioned. So eight days after Robert E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox, the city's financial leaders started a new federally chartered bank after meeting with Hamilton G. Fant. First National Bank opened for business in the Customs House. Lee was one of the new bank's early customers.\n\nLater it merged with National Exchange Bank and moved to 10th and Main streets. Despite the financial crises of the 1890s First National Bank had the most assets of any Richmond bank at the turn of the century (1900).<ref name=nps>\"Federal, State and Local Historic Districts , National Park Service.

The first bank in Fairfax, Virginia, it was organized in 1902. In 1931, the bank completed construction of a new building on the site of the former Willcoxon Tavern. The Moore and McCandlish law firm, which had offices on the second floor of the former bank building built in 1905, occupied the building until 1972. Community Bank of Northern Virginia, organized in 1992 in Sterling, moved into the building that same year.\n\nBanks which merged with First & Merchants Bank:\nSavings Bank & Trust Co., January 30, 1959\nFirst National Bank, Ashland, Virginia, December 31, 1959\nPetersburg Savings & American Trust Co., December 30, 1961\nAugusta National Bank, Staunton, September 29, 1962\nFirst National Bank, Newport News, November 1, 1962\nPeoples National Bank & Trust Co., Lynchburg, January 31, 1963 \nFirst National Bank, Waynesboro, July 31, 1964\nLoudoun National Bank, Leesburg, September 1, 1965\nBank of Virginia Beach, January 1, 1966\nBank of Chesapeake, January 31, 1966\nSuburban National Bank of Virginia, McLean, August 1, 1970\nFirst National Bank, Danville, June 30, 1979\nServices National Bank, Arlington, November 30, 1979\nThe Bank of Chatham, October 1980\nThe National Bank of Fairfax, June 30, 1981\n\nVirginia National Bank\nNorfolk National Bank was organized in 1885 and became \"not only the leading bank of Norfolk, but probably the leading bank of Virginia, having recently increased its capital to one million dollars, with a surplus of half a million.\" Norfolk National Bank, Trust Company of Norfolk (1895) and National Bank of Commerce (1867) joined to become Norfolk National Bank of Commerce & Trusts, which joined with Virginia National Bank of Norfolk to become National Bank of Commerce of Norfolk October 9, 1933.\n\nPeople's National Bank was organized in 1903 in Roanoke.\n\nIn 1920, Church Street Bank at Church and Freemason streets in Norfolk became American Exchange Bank, whose deposits were taken over in 1924 by Virginia National Bank.\n\nCliff Cutchins, who in 1980 became chairman and CEO of Virginia National Bankshares Inc. and held the same positions at Sovran until his 1989 retirement, started out as a teller in 1947 at Vaughan & Co. Bankers in Franklin, Virginia. In 1960, he became president of the bank, which his grandfather had founded in 1886. In 1962, a merger with two Southampton County banks formed Tidewater Bank and Trust Co., which in turn became part of Virginia National Bank.\n\nVirginia National Bank's 24-story Norfolk headquarters opened in January 1968.\n\nRichmond's Virginia Trust Company could be chartered only after special legislation, since trust companies were new in the south and not all banks could have trust departments. The original board of directors included a number of tobacco company executives. James B. Pace, the first president, was a tobacco executive and the head of Planters National Bank (which became United Virginia Bank). The Virginia Trust Company building, also designed by Bossom, opened May 31, 1921, was an example of Neo-Classical Revival architecture, using granite, marble, bronze and mahogany, with a \"gilded, coffered ceiling\" and \"a facade patterned directly after a Roman triumphal arch.\" Virginia Trust Company merged with Virginia National Bank in 1973.\n\nBanks which merged with what became Virginia National Bankshares, Inc.:\nMerchants & Planters Bank, Norfolk, November 4, 1957\nPeople's National Bank of Central Virginia, Charlottesville, April 26, 1963\nNational Bank of Suffolk, August 23, 1963\nFarmers Exchange Bank of Abingdon, September 13, 1963\nFarmers & Merchants Bank, Staunton and Tidewater Bank & Trust, Franklin, December 13, 1963\nFirst National Bank of Buena Vista and Southern Bank of Commerce, Danville, April 3, 1964\nBank of Glade Spring, January 29, 1965\nPeople's National Bank of Farmville and First National Bank of Gate City, April 8, 1965\nMerchants National Bank and Bank of Phoebus, Hampton, November 5, 1965\nPeoples National Bank, Victoria and Wythe County National Bank, Wytheville, April 11, 1966 \nPulaski National Bank and Bank of Crewe, August 26, 1966\nFarmers & Merchants Bank, Lawrenceville, National Bank of Woodstock, June 29, 1968\nNorthampton County Trust Bank, Cape Charles, November 15, 1968\nCommonwealth National Bank, Arlington, August 15, 1969\nFirst National Bank, Quantico, December 19, 1969\nFirst National Bank, Harrisonburg, March 15, 1970 \nMerchants & Farmers Bank, Smithfield, June 1, 1970\nCarroll County Bank, Hillsville, November 23, 1970\nFirst National Bank, Troutville, 1981\nFarmers Exchange Bank, Coeburn, 1981\nOld Colony Bank & Trust, Williamsburg\nSouth Boston Bank & Trust Co., 1982\nFirst State Bank of Wise, 1982\nNorthern Virginia Bank of Springfield, 1982\nFirst City Bank, Newport News, 1982\nCitizens National Bank, Fries, 1982\nFarmers Bank, Mathews, 1982\n\nGrowth of Sovran Bank\nThe name Sovran came from Glenn Monigle & Associates Inc. of Denver, Colorado.\n\nIn 1985, Sovran announced a merger with Suburban Bancorp, the fourth-largest bank in Maryland at the time. Silver Spring National Bank, the first bank in Silver Spring, Maryland, in 1910, moved in 1925 when the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad underpass was built. The name changed to Suburban National Bank in 1938 when the bank took over Takoma Park Bank.\n\nIn 1986, Sovran took over D.C. National Bancorp, based in Bethesda, Maryland. In 1987, Sovran added Kentucky and Tennessee by buying 71-year-old Commerce Union'' of Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nSovran Bank was the largest bank in Virginia and in the District of Columbia, and it had offices in Tennessee and Maryland. In September 1989, Sovran and Citizens & Southern of Atlanta announced plans for a stock-swap merger. The combined bank had $47 billion in assets, $34 billion in deposits and 976 branches in eight states. It was originally to be named Advantor Financial Corporation. However, it was eventually called C&S/Sovran. The merged bank had dual headquarters in Atlanta and Norfolk.\n\nOnly two years later, C&S/Sovran was sent reeling by problem loans in the Washington/Northern Virginia market. Under the circumstances, it had little choice but to agree to merge with NCNB Corporation of Charlotte.  Ironically, C&S had merged with Sovran to fend off a hostile takeover attempt by NCNB. The merged bank became NationsBank.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPhoto of First National Bank building in Richmond, Virginia\nPhoto of First National Bank Building entrance in Richmond, Virginia\nPhoto of Virginia National Bank headquarters in Norfolk\nPhoto of Sovran Bank Building in Norfolk, Virginia (September, 1986)\n\nBanks based in Virginia\nDefunct banks of the United States\nBank of America legacy banks\nBanks established in 1983\nCompanies based in Norfolk, Virginia\nBanks disestablished in 1990\n1983 establishments in Virginia\n1990 disestablishments in Virginia\nDefunct companies based in Virginia", "The Jhelum River (/d\u0292\u02b0e\u02d0l\u0259m/) is a river in the northern Indian subcontinent. It originates at Verinag and flows through the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir, into the Pakistani-administered territory of Kashmir, then the Pakistani province of Punjab. It is the westernmost of the five rivers of the Punjab region, and flows through the Kashmir Valley. It is a tributary of the Chenab River and has a total length of about .\n\nEtymology\n\n, a Pakistani author, recorded some stories of the name Jhelum in his book Tareekh-e-Jhelum as:Many writers have different opinions about the name of Jhelum. One suggestion is that in ancient days Jhelumabad was known as Jalham. The word Jhelum is reportedly derived from the words Jal (pure water) and Ham (snow). The name thus refers to the waters of a river (flowing beside the city) which have their origins in the snow-capped Himalayas.\n\nThe Sanskrit name for the river is Vit\u00e1st\u0101, derived from an apocryphal legend regarding the origin of the river in the Nilamata Purana. The name survives in the Kashmiri name for this river, Vyath.\n\nHistory\n\nThe river Jhelum was called Hydaspes () by the ancient Greeks. \n\nAlexander the Great and his army crossed the Jhelum in BC 326 at the Battle of the Hydaspes River, where he defeated an Indian king, Porus. According to Arrian (Anabasis, 29), he built a city \"on the spot whence he started to cross the river Hydaspes\", which he named Bukephala (or Bucephala) to honour his famous horse Bucephalus, buried in Jalalpur Sharif. It is thought that ancient Bukephala was near the site of modern Jhelum. According to Gujrat district historian Mansoor Behzad Butt, Bukephalus was buried in Jalalpur Sharif, but the people of Mandi Bahauddin, a district close to Jehlum, believed that their tehsil Phalia was named after Alexander's dead horse, saying that the name Phalia was a distortion of Bucephala. \n\nThe waters of the Jhelum are allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty. India is working on a hydropower project on a tributary of Jhelum river to establish first-use rights on the river water over Pakistan as per the Indus Waters Treaty.\n\nMythology\n\nThe ancient Greeks regarded the river as a god, as they did most mountains and streams. The poet Nonnus in the Dionysiaca calls the Hydaspes a titan-descended god, the son of the sea-god Thaumas and the cloud-goddess Elektra, the brother of Iris, goddess of the rainbow, and half-brother to the harpies, the snatching winds. Since the river is in a foreign country, it is not clear whether they named the river after the god, or whether the god Hydaspes was named after the river.\nAccording to the Nilmata Purana, Hindu goddess Parvati was requested by the sage Kasyapa to come to Kashmir to purify the land from the evil practices and impurities of the Pisachas living there. Parvati then assumed the form of a river in the netherworld. Then Lord Shiva struck with his spear near the abode of Nila, (Verinag spring). With that stroke of the spear, Parvati came out of the netherworld. Shiva himself named her Vitasta. He had excavated with the spear a ditch measuring one vitasti, through which the river, gone to the netherworld,  came out, so he gave her the name Vit\u00e1st\u0101.\n\nCourse\nThe river Jhelum rises from Verinag spring at the foot of the Pir Panjal in the southeastern Kashmir Valley administered by India. It is joined by its tributaries \nLidder River near village Mirgund at Khanabal \nVeshaw River at Sangam in Anantnag \nSind River at Shadipora\nPohru River at Doabgah in Sopore, Jammu and Kashmir. \nIt flows through Srinagar and Wular Lake before entering Pakistan-administered Kashmir through a deep narrow gorge. The Neelum River, the largest tributary of the Jhelum, joins it at Domel, Muzaffarabad, as does the next largest, the Kunhar River of Kaghan Valley. It is then joined by the Poonch River, and flows into the Mangla Dam reservoir in the Mirpur District. The Jhelum enters Pakistani Punjab in the Jhelum District. From there, it flows through the plains of Pakistan's Punjab, forming the boundary between the Jech and Sindh Sagar Doabs. It ends in a confluence with the Chenab River at Trimmu in the Jhang District. The Chenab merges with the Sutlej to form the Panjnad River, which joins the Indus River at Mithankot.\n\nMost of the villages and important cities of Kashmir valley are situated on the banks of Jhelum.\n\nLakes\n\nDams and barrages\nThe river has rich power generation potential in India. Water control structures are being built as a result of the Indus Basin Project, including the following:\n Mangla Dam, completed in 1967, is one of the largest earth-fill dams in the world, with a storage capacity of \n Karot Hydropower Project is an under-construction concrete-core rockfill gravity large dam in Pakistan, with a planned installed capacity of 720 MW.\n Rasul Barrage, constructed in 1967, has a maximum flow of 850,000\u00a0ft\u00b3/s (24,000 m\u00b3/s).\n Trimmu Barrage, constructed in 1939 some 20\u00a0km from Jhang Sadar at the confluence with the Chenab, has maximum discharge capacity of 645,000\u00a0ft\u00b3/s (18,000 m\u00b3/s).\n Haranpur (Victoria Bridge) Constructed in 1933 Approximate 5\u00a0km from Malakwal near Chak Nizam village.

An artist named John Goray first influenced him when Battenberg was about 10 years old.  Battenberg did his undergraduate work in art at various Midwestern universities.  He also attended the Ruskin School, Oxford University for two years.  He received M.F.A.'s from Michigan State University and California School of Arts and Crafts.\n\nBattenberg has resided in both Italy and England.  He was a professor of sculpture at San Jos\u00e9 State University and now holds the title of professor emeritus.  He left his professorship to pursue his sculpture full-time.  In 2007, Battenberg returned to painting for a number of reasons, one of which was a leg injury which eventually prevented him from sculpting.\n\nThe Honolulu Museum of Art, the Krannert Art Museum (University of Illinois, Champaign, Illinois), the National Museum of Wildlife Art (Jackson Hole, Wyoming), the Oakland Museum of California (Oakland, California) the San Diego Museum of Art, the Seattle Art Museum (Seattle, Washington), the Syracuse University Art Collection (Syracuse, New York), the Triton Museum of Art (Santa Clara, California), and Phoenix University (Phoenix, Arizona) are among the public collections holding his work.\n\nIn 2009 John began using a technique utilizing a series of layers of painted images sandwiched between an equal number of 1/8\u201d layers of optically clear plastic resin; creating a three dimensionality. Battenberg successfully moved his Koi to Arizona from California in 2006; some of his exotic Koi subjects are over 30 years old. Battenberg's Koi are the subjects of his 3D paintings.\n\nJohn Battenberg lived his final years in Scottsdale, with his wife Lynn, two cats, an aviary of birds, and twenty-seven Koi fish contained in two outdoor ponds.  He died on July 8, 2012, in Scottsdale.\n\nReferences\n\n Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, \"Separate Realities: California Representational Painting/Sculpture\", Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, 1973.\n Sarda, Michel F., \"Faces of Arizona: A Tribute to Arizona Artists \", Phoenix, Bridgewood Press, 1998.\n\nExternal links\n  John Battenberg\n John Battenberg Sculpture Extraordinaire\n\n1931 births\n2012 deaths\nArtists from Milwaukee\nSculptors from Wisconsin", "Ralph Dowey  (1844 \u2013 1909) was a Northumberland born miner, songwriter and poet.\n\nRalph Dowey  was born in  October 1844 at 42 South Row, West Holywell, a small Colliery village approx. 4 miles west of Whitley Bay, which at the time was in the county of Northumberland. \nHe was a miner by trade, like so many Geordie songwriters\n\nSongwriting was a hobby, and according to Thomas Allan in his Illustrated Edition of Tyneside Songs and Readings won at least 8 prizes for his songs in the various North Eastern songwriting competitions.

It was released in 1988.\n\nBackground\nShow Boat was first staged on 15 November 1927 at an out-of-town tryout at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C.. In accordance with normal practice, the creators of the show made several changes to it before its Broadway premiere at the Ziegfeld Theatre six weeks later. The Pantry scene (Act 1, Scene 2) and the Waterfront saloon scene (Act 1, Scene 3) were shortened, \"Mis'ry's comin' aroun'\", \"I would like to play a lover's part\" and \"It's getting hotter in the north\" were discarded, and \"I might fall back on you\", \"Why do I love you?\" and \"Hey, feller!\" were added.\n\nThe performing score that John McGlinn constructed for his album is a conflation of Jerome Kern's Washington and New York versions, and more comprehensive than either. The Pantry and Waterfront saloon scenes are recorded in their abbreviated versions, but the three numbers deleted before the show's Broadway premiere are reinstated, and the three new numbers composed for New York are included too. Nearly all of the dialogue for which Kern composed underscoring is present as well. An hour-long appendix presents further material. McGlinn provides the original, longer versions of the Pantry and Waterfront saloon scenes; \"Kim's imitations\", a number written for the first Kim, Norma Terris, when she declined to sing \"It's getting hotter in the north\" on the grounds that it was \"lousy jazz\"; \"Dance away the night\", a number written for the show's first London staging in 1928; \"Gallivantin' aroun'\", \"I have the room above her\" and \"Ah still suits me\", numbers composed for Universal's 1936 Show Boat movie; \"Nobody else but me\", the last song that Kern wrote, composed for a revival of the show in 1946; and four numbers that were dropped in rehearsal, \"Yes, ma'am\", \"A pack of cards\", \"The Creole love song\" and \"Out there in an orchard\". A fifth number excised before the Washington tryout, the Trocadero opening chorus, is included in the main body of the album.\n\nThe three songs from the 1936 film are heard with orchestrations that Larry Moore transcribed from its soundtrack. The orchestrations for the five numbers discarded during rehearsal were composed by Russell Warner. The remaining orchestrations are all the original versions crafted by Robert Russell Bennett. Thought lost for decades, they were found just a few years before the album was made: Bennett and the musical theatre historian Miles Kreuger unearthed one batch in 1978 in the Rodgers and Hammerstein's Music Library's Queens warehouse on West 52nd Street, and a further cache was found in 1982 in Warner Brothers' music archive in their warehouse in Secaucus, New Jersey. The vocal score of \"A pack of cards\" was recovered even more serendipitously: the only copy of it known to have survived turned up amongst a sheaf of old sheet music in a second-hand book store in Sacramento, California.\n\nThe making of the album was beset by several difficulties. While the estates of Kern and Edna Ferber were enthusiastic about the project, Oscar Hammerstein's son William thought it fundamentally misconceived, believing that the alterations that had been made to the show in its tryout phase had been done with good reason and ought not to be reversed. Moreover, Warner Brothers and the Kern estate spent five years wrangling over who owned the copyright of the hundreds of pages of Kern's manuscripts that had been disinterred in Secaucus. The Secaucus material that McGlinn needed for his album did not become available to him until three days before he recorded it, and then only because Beverly Sills, operatic eminence and a director of Warner Communications, prevailed upon the company to sell McGlinn and EMI the scores that they wanted for a sum in five figures. (The cost of making the entire album exceeded half a million dollars.)\n\nA further problem arose from Hammerstein's lyrics. The very first word uttered in the musical is \"Niggers\". It had long been customary to censor this, but McGlinn did not want to subject Hammerstein's text to bowdlerization. When the black artists whom he had recruited from the Glyndebourne Festival's production of Porgy and Bess to form Show Boats Black Chorus realized what they were going to have to sing, they resigned from the project in protest, and Willard White, McGlinn's preferred Joe, decided to go with them. McGlinn replaced White with Bruce Hubbard, also hired from Glyndebourne, after the baritone had spent a day conferring with Eartha Kitt and other friends about whether he should accept McGlinn's invitation. The Black Chorus's music was taken over by members of the Ambrosian Singers who had already been contracted to supply the album's other choral requirements.\n\nEdward Seckerson interviewed John McGlinn about the making of the album for a feature article published in  Gramophone in November 1988. Christopher Swann shot extensive footage of the making of the album for a Granada Television documentary, The Show Boat Story, which has become available to view online.\n\nRecording\nThe album was digitally recorded in June, July and August 1987 in Studio No. 1, Abbey Road Studios, London.\n\nCover art\nThe covers of the LP, cassette and CD versions of the album all use an image adapted from the dust-jacket designed by Ren\u00e9 Clarke for the first edition of the Edna Ferber novel upon which the musical is based, Show Boat, published by Doubleday, Page & Company in 1926.\n\nCritical reception\nReviews\n\nAndrew Lamb reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in November 1988. \"Never\", he wrote, \"... have I been so bowled over by a musical theatre recording as by this\". Before listening to it, he had been apprehensive that it might be one of those albums on which a Broadway score was mistreated by a gang of gatecrashers from the world of opera. In the event, his fears had proved needless.\n\nInnumerable artists, among them some of the most eminent, had sung \"Bill\", \"Ol' man river\", \"Make believe\" and \"Can't help lovin' dat man\", but none that Lamb had ever heard had presented these numbers with the \"beauty and style\" bestowed upon them by the singers chosen by John McGlinn. \"The love duets between [Frederica] von Stade and Jerry Hadley\", he wrote, were \"quite stunningly beautiful, and Bruce Hubbard's firm, honeyed baritone has absolutely nothing to fear from the inevitable comparisons with Paul Robeson\".\n\nIn their secondary roles, Karla Burns (as Queenie), David Garrison (as Frank), Robert Nichols (as Cap'n Andy) and Paige O'Hara (as Ellie) were all \"superb\" too. This was not to say that every soloist was entirely perfect in every respect. Teresa Stratas, while \"ravishing\" in \"Can't help lovin' dat man\", occasionally came across as \"a shade too self-conscious\", and Nancy Kulp brought back memories of Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie.\n\nThere was no doubt that the Ambrosian Chorus had relished their \"rousing\" contributions, and the London Sinfonietta were positively riotous in the jazzy music that Kern wrote for Kim's scene in Act 3. But neither they nor any of the album's famous soloists deserved as much credit for the album's success as its conductor. John McGlinn's use of Robert Russell Bennett's original orchestrations made his recording very different from any previous version of Show Boat. This was plain from the very first bars of the overture: a tuba sounded \"a note of dark foreboding\" before a cheery banjo led the way to the orchestra's enthusiastic introduction to \"Why do I love you?\". (As well as his work on the podium, McGlinn put in a cameo appearance as Magnolia's rehearsal pianist in Act 2.)\n\nThe album's historical authenticity was not the only thing that set it apart from its predecessors. It was also encyclopedically comprehensive. \"Mis'ry's comin' aroun'\" was just one of several excellent pieces heard on McGlinn's discs that had been excised from the score of Show Boat almost before Kern's ink had had time to dry. An appendix included every note that a Kern devotee could desire, except for \"How'd you like to spoon with me?\", a number added for a production in London in 1928. McGlinn had also recorded lengthy passages of underscored dialogue, and it was the magnificence of these, ironically, that laid him open to accusations of an error of judgement. There were places - Act 1, Scene 3 for example - where dialogue was wholly absent. \"By all means abridge the linking dialogue\", Lamb wrote, \"but to include the dialogue and underscoring complete in some scenes and not at all in others seems to me to distort the scale and balance of the piece\". It might have been wiser to buy room for the missing dialogue by pruning the appendix a little. Two of its items - found in manuscript in a second-hand bookshop - hardly sounded as though they had anything to do with the Cotton Blossom at all.\n\nAll in all, though, the album was an \"inspired\", \"quite irresistible achievement\". What Solti's Decca Ring cycle had been to the history of opera, McGlinn's Show Boat was to the history of American musical theatre.\n\nEric Salzman reviewed the album on CD in Stereo Review in December 1988. \"John McGlinn\", he wrote, \"is a man on a mission: to restore the lost glories of the great old American musical\". His Show Boat was the most ambitious project that he had undertaken to date. Never before had a musical been reconstructed so meticulously. The original score, numbers that were dropped and new numbers  composed for the stage or the screen were all present and correct.\n\nRobert Russell Bennett's 1927 orchestrations had been retrieved from the cobwebbed recesses of a warehouse in Secaucus. The sombre overture had been rescued from oblivion. Listeners could enjoy several wonderful old dance tunes and some liberally underscored dialogue (unbowdlerized. even at its most offensive).\n\nShow Boat itself. alas, was not as great a work as some of its apologists claimed. Its source, Edna Ferber's novel, was not \"a deathless work of art ('potboiler' might be closer to the mark)\". Oscar Hammerstein II's text was spoiled by a ramshackle plot and a good deal of sentimentality. Despite moments of seriousness such as \"Ol' man river\", it was concerned less with social history or psychology than with the hackneyed trope of \"what show-biz folks are like behind the scenes.\" Kern's frequent repetition of his catchiest melodies was an instance of a composer flogging his best tunes to death, not of one engaged in an architecture of Wagnerian leitmotivs. Kern and Hammerstein had crafted their magnum opus at a time when Puccini was in his grave, and Berg, Eugene O'Neill. Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill were already famous. Show Boat was already old-fashioned when it was premiered, and it would be a mistake to claim more for it than \"a certain antique charm\".\n\nMcGlinn's cast included some outstanding singers, but it was questionable whether a Show Boat starring Frederica von Stade, Jerry Hadley, Teresa Stratas and Bruce Hubbard could seem other than a \"very old-fashioned, if inspired operetta\". Kern had tried to re-energize the tired genre in which he worked with an infusion of jazz and blues. These were musical territories to which most of McGlinn's stars were strangers, and McGlinn's brisk, businesslike conducting allowed little scope for a bluesy mood to be created. Karla Burns was a \"heavy jazz and blues performer of the old school\", but McGlinn never gave her an opportunity to really do her thing. McGlinn's London Sinfonietta did not have a rhythm section that could play either jazz or blues satisfactorily.\n\nMcGlinn's album was best enjoyed when listened to unreflectively. One could recognize that it was an extraordinary performance. McGlinn's rebuilt performing score worked very well. His long appendix was a cornucopia of treats. Von Stade and Stratas were astute enough to sing Kern in a manner closer to that of operetta than to that of their usual opera. McGlinn's pacing was sometimes too brisk, but most of his tempos were appropriate, and he took \"the bigger numbers (where he is at his best) up to some rather breathless and even thrilling heights\".\n\nTo sum up, Show Boat was not a work of any depth either musically or dramatically. But Hammerstein made up for his crude storytelling with some good, and even great, lyrics. Kern supplied \"endlessly lavish musical innovation\", and was one of the few composers to have successfully infused operetta with a contemporary American idiom. Bennett's orchestrations were extremely well crafted. The best numbers in the score \"had not lost any of their lustre\". There were enough good things in Show Boat to merit the \"care and genuine affection\" and \"devotion, talent and enthusiasm\" with which McGlinn and his colleagues had gone about their work,\n\nJ. B. Steane reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in January 1989. At first, he wrote, listening to the recording was blissful. The overture, with its ominous opening chord, delighted and impressed him with its implicit promise of a performance of genuine substance. Then the first few choruses lifted him up into the gaiety of the Cotton Blossom's spirit. Magnolia von Stade's contribution to \"Only make believe\" melted him; Bruce Hubbard's \"Ol' man river\" enraptured him; and \"when it came to 'Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly' and their many repetitions, they couldn't do what they gotta do too often for me\". And then, having loved everything that he had heard thus far, he decided to take a break.\n\nAfter his interval, he rejoiced to find that some of the musical's biggest hits were still to come. But between \"Why do I love you\" and \"Just my Bill\", things started to go wrong. There was a lacuna in the narrative. He wanted to know what had happened to the characters in the interval, but EMI's booklet had nothing to say on the matter. The disappointment would have been easy to shrug off if the music had sustained its excellence, but then, in the music-hall sequence, Kern's inspiration seemed to wilt in tandem with the album's story-telling. Ravenal's desertion of Magnolia was glossed over, and the ending of the piece felt all but \"perfunctory\". Like Lamb before him, Steane felt that McGlinn would have been wiser to sacrifice some of his bonus tracks in order to make room for more dialogue. \"Scholarship and entertainment are somewhat at odds here.\"\n\nPatrick O'Connor mentioned the album in Gramophone in March 2003 while reviewing a disc of excerpts from it. It was, he wrote, \"something of a landmark, ... one of the best recordings of any music-theatre piece ever made. The cast is flawless, ... with Teresa Stratas a vivid, ironic Julie. ... John McGlinn has done nothing better in disc; the production sounds as fresh now as fifteen years ago.\"\n\nWriting about the making of the album in The New York Times on 25 September 1988, Stephen Holden described it as \"magnificently recorded and sung\" with \"vital, intense performances\".\n\nAccolades\nWriting in Gramophone in December 1988, Adrian Edwards included the album in his Critics' Choice list of the best recordings of the year. \"I had never believed that Show Boat could be mentioned in the same breath as Porgy and Bess,\" he wrote, \"yet McGlinn's recording demonstrates how subtly Kern and Hammerstein placed each number in the course of their 180-minute saga.\"\n\nIn the Gramophone Awards for 1989, the album won the prize for the best musical theatre recording of the year.\n\nWriting in Gramophone in December 1989, Andrew Lamb named the album as his Critics' Choice best recording of the decade. \"To select a Record of the Eighties is a formidable task indeed\", he wrote. \"But ... I find no real challenge for the three-CD Show Boat. ... Singing and playing are superb, and ... the use of original orchestrations plays its part in the success; as well as the inclusion of much splendid, rediscovered music,\"\n\nTrack listing, CD1Jerome Kern (1885\u20131945)Show Boat'' (1927), with book and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II (1895\u20131960); adapted from the novel Show Boat (1926) by Edna Ferber (1885\u20131968); with original orchestrations by Robert Russell Bennett and additional orchestrations by Russell Warner and Larry Moore\n\n 1 (5:34) Overture\nAct One, Scene OneCotton Blossom 2 (4:54) \"Niggers all work on de Mississippi\" (Stevedores, Gals, Queenie, Steve, Pete, 1st Mincing Miss, 2nd Mincing Miss, Beaux, Girls, Boys)\n 3 (0:47) \"Andy!!!\" (Parthy, Windy, 1st Mincing Miss, 2nd Mincing Miss)Cap'n Andy's Ballyhoo 4 (3:41) \"Here comes the Show Boat parade!\" (Boy, Girls, Boys, Andy, Parthy)\n 5 (3:58) \"Hey Julie\" (Pete, Julie, Steve, Parthy, Andy, Ellie)\n 6 (1:26) \"It's a man\" (Ellie, Ravenal, Vallon)Where's the mate for me? 7 (3:35) \"Who cares if my boat goes upstream\" (Ravenal, Magnolia)Make believe 8 (5:02) \"Only make believe I love you\" (Ravenal, Magnolia, Vallon)Ol' man river 9 (5:42) \"Oh, Joe!\" (Magnolia, Joe, Men)\nAct One, Scene TwoCan't help lovin' dat man10 (8:07) \"What cher doin' all by yourself, Miss Nola?\" (Queenie, Magnolia, Julie, Joe, Servants)\nAct One, Scene ThreeLife on the wicked stage11 (3:36) \"Why do stage struck maidens clamor\" (Ellie, Girls)Till good luck comes my way12 (2:26) \"The man who ventures with chance\" (Ravenal, Men)\nAct One, Scene FourMis'ry's comin' aroun'13 (6:10) \"Mis'ry's comin' aroun'\" (Queenie, Women, Joe, Magnolia, Julie, Men, Solo Bass)\n14 (3:38) \"Take her up, Rubberface!\" (Andy, Julie, Steve, Magnolia, Parthy, Ellie, Windy)\n15 (2:46) \"Hello, Windy\" (Vallon, Andy, Magnolia, Steve, Julie, Windy, Ellie, Parthy)\n16 (3:20) \"You needn't look at us\" (Steve, Black Chorus, Andy, Parthy, Magnolia, Ellie, Frank)\n17 (5:25) \"Looks like a swell\" (Andy, Parthy, Frank, Ravenal, Julie, Magnolia, Steve, Joe)\n\nTrack listing, CD2\nAct One, Scene FiveI would like to play a lover's part 1 (4:10) \"Her face is fair to look upon\" (Boys, Girls, Ellie, Frank)I might fall back on you 2 (3:00) \"Little girl, you are safe with me\" (Frank, Ellie, Girls)Queenie's Ballyhoo 3 (3:14) \"Is de theater fillin' up, Cap'n Andy?\" (Queenie, Andy, Black Chorus)\nAct One, Scene SixVillain Dance 4 (0:58) Dance\nAct One, Scene SevenYou are love 5 (8:00) \"That you, Nola?\" (Ravenal, Windy, Magnolia, Parthy)\nAct One, Scene EightFinale, Act One 6 (6:05) \"Oh tell me, did you ever!

Shuangliu Airport is one of the two core hubs for Air China, the other being Beijing Capital International Airport. The airport is also the principal hub and headquarters for Sichuan Airlines and Chengdu Airlines. China Eastern Airlines, China Southern Airlines, Shenzhen Airlines, Lucky Air, and Tibet Airlines also have bases at Shuangliu Airport.\n\nShuangliu Airport was the third-busiest airport in the world and the second-busiest airport in China in 2020.\n\nOverview\n\nHistory\nThe airport, formerly named Shuangguisi Airport, opened as an auxiliary military airfield in 1938 during the Second Sino-Japanese War/World War II. At the time, its runway was only large enough for small biplanes. It was also where the Republic of China Air Force Polikarpov I-15 fighters of the 5th Pursuit Group were based for aerial defense of the Chengdu area against Imperial Japanese bomber raids;this following the Chinese retreat from Wuhan to Chungking (now Chongqing) as the new provisional capital in aftermath of the Battle of Wuhan against the Imperial Japanese onslaught. Civilian targets were indiscriminately bombed, and ace fighter pilot of the Chinese Air Force Major Wong Sun-shui, Captain Cen Zeliu and Lieutenant Lin Heng (younger brother of renowned architect and poet Lin Huiyin) flying in their I-15 fighter planes were all killed over Shuangliu air base as a result of battling against the most advanced fighter aircraft of the time; the Mitsubishi A6M \"Zero\" (Reisen) fighter, in defense of Chengdu on 14 March 1941.\n\nWhen the U.S. was shocked into World War II with the Pearl Harbor attack, the airport became known as \"Shwangliu Airfield\" as it was later used by the United States Army Air Forces Fourteenth Air Force as part of the China Defensive Campaign (1942\u20131945). It was used as a fighter base by the 33d Fighter Group, which flew P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bombers from the airport in 1944 to support Chinese ground forces, and also by reconnaissance units that operated camera-equipped P-38 Lightnings that located Japanese forces and provided intelligence to the fighter-bombers. The Americans closed their facilities at Shwangliu Airfield at the end of August 1945.\n\nOn 12 December 1956, the Shuangguisi Airport was put under civil aviation, which was then formally listed as a civil aviation airport and renamed Chengdu Shuangliu Airport. In 1957, the flights of Chengdu civil aviation were shifted to Shuangliu Airport from Guanghan Airport. The flight courses from Chengdu were thus opened to various cities within China including Beijing, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Chongqing, Kunming, Guiyang, and Nanchong. The airport went through several earlier expansions in 1959, 1967, 1983 and 1991 respectively.\n\nCurrent status\nA large-scale expansion was conducted on flight area and navigation area from 1994 to 2001. The runway was extended to  with Class 4E rating, allowing for larger jumbo jets including the Boeing 747-400. The newly built terminal building was incorporated with a three-parallel-porch design, accommodating an hourly capacity of 3,500 passengers during rush hours, while the previous terminal building was only designated for regional flights within Sichuan and Chongqing.\n\nThe airport is now an international civil airport with flights to more than 50 international destinations and over 170 domestic airports, and is a hub for Chengdu Airlines, Air China and Sichuan Airlines. It is linked to downtown Chengdu by the Airport Expressway, the Chengdu\u2013Mianyang\u2013Leshan intercity railway and the newly built Chengdu Metro line 10 which has stations in both terminals. KLM launched the first intercontinental air route from Chengdu, to Amsterdam, on 28 May 2006.\n\nThe construction of its second runway started from late 2008, and service commenced in December 2009. The completed new runway,  in length and  in width, upgraded the previous flight area rating from 4E to 4F, capable of handling the Airbus A380.\nThe new Terminal 2 has started construction in June 2009; trial operations began on 28 July 2012 with limited airlines and was officially opened on 9 August 2012 for all domestic airlines other than Sichuan Airlines. T1 is split into Domestic and International wings, and retained all international flights from airlines within and outside China. The new terminal is twice the size of the current T1, and allows the airport to handle up to 50 million passengers annually.\n\nOn 9 June 2014, United Airlines began operating a nonstop service from San Francisco to Chengdu, connecting central China to the United States non-stop for the first time. Service to the US has since expanded, as Hainan Airlines now offers nonstop service from Chengdu to Los Angeles and began nonstop service to New York\u2013JFK in October 2017. In addition, Sichuan Airlines and Air China have many international routes in this airport.\n\nWith the opening of Chengdu Tianfu Airport on 27 June 2021, it is planned for most international and cargo routes to be moved away from Shuangliu Airport, which is to mainly operate domestic flights going forward.\n\nAirlines and destinations\n\nPassenger\n\nOther facilities\nChina Southwest Airlines once had its headquarters on the airport property.\n\nStatistics\n\nGround transportation\n\nAirport buses\n\n Airport Bus No. 1, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport - City Centre (Minshan Hotel, Section 2 of Renmin Road South, Metro station of Jinjiang Hotel); single ticket: \uffe510.\n Airport Bus No. 2, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport - Chengdu railway station (North Railway Station); single ticket: up to \uffe510.\n Airport Bus No. 3, Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport - Chengdu East railway station (Chengdu Dong Railway Station); single ticket: \uffe512.\n\nTaxi\nIt costs about RMB 60 Yuan from Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport to the city centre of Chengdu.\n\nHigh-speed train (CRH)\n\nPassengers can take the CRH train at Shuangliu Airport railway station to Chengdu South railway station and Chengdu East railway station; single tickets are about \uffe511 (US$1.5).

Rapidly rotating the external cylinder (in case of the Char 2C tank design at 300 rpm with an electric motor) created the visual illusion of seeing through the cupola as if not there due to human persistence of vision, similar to how a plank fence with alternating planks and holes fades from view when the observer moves alongside it at a speed. The short time both the inner and outer slits were perfectly aligned at any given moment still afforded protection of the inside space, as any projectile not capable of piercing the armour directly would need hit the spaced out slits and to come at an optimum angle and timing to go through both outer and inner slit, while it still allowed a better view of the surroundings than just a single vision slit or periscope with a very narrow field of view.\n\nReferences\n\nOptical illusions", "Vadakkumangudi is a village in Papanasam taluk , Thanjavur District, in India.

It entered service in 1983.\n\nDesign and development\nIn the 1950s the Royal Navy was equipped with British designed and built Mk 30 air-dropped torpedoes. These were passive homing weapons which relied on detecting the noise from submarine targets. However, as submarine noise levels decreased these weapons became ineffective. A design for a British Mk 31 torpedo which would have used active echo-location sonar failed to receive Government approval for production. US Mk 44 torpedoes were purchased for the Royal Navy in the 1960s to fill this role, and later replaced by US Mk 46 torpedoes.\n\nA desire not to be dependent on US torpedo purchases led to a research programme starting in 1964 to develop a British torpedo. Initially designated Naval and Air Staff Requirement (NASR) 7511, it was (much later in the late 1970s) designated the Sting Ray torpedo.\n\nDesign\nDesign studies in the mid-1960s proposed that a tank of polyethylene oxide be carried behind the warhead. This polymer would be exuded at the nose to reduce the drag coefficient. Experiments using buoyancy-propelled torpedoes in 1969 had shown reductions in the drag coefficient up to 25%. However, by 1969 this scheme had been rejected in favour of carrying a larger battery.\n\nThe homing system developed in the mid-1960s incorporated a spinning magnetic disc onto which the acoustic correlation algorithms were etched but this was replaced by integrated circuit technology when the disc sometimes failed to survive the impact of the weapon with the sea from high altitude launches.\n\nThe original warhead concept was for a simple omnidirectional blast charge. However, studies in the 1970s showed that this would be inadequate against the large double-hulled submarines then entering service. A directed energy (shaped charge) warhead was used in the production weapon.\n\nIn 1976 the designs had to be completely revised. Swapping the project for buying a ready-made US torpedo was not considered because the torpedo was expected to be better, and was all-British.\n\nManufacture\nThe torpedo was built at the MSDS (later MUSL) plants at Neston (in Cheshire) and MUSL in Farlington and Waterlooville near Portsmouth. Guidance systems were made by Sperry Gyroscope Company.\n\nDeployment\nThe original in-service version (Sting Ray Mod 0) is officially documented as entering service in 1983, although Mark Higgitt's book Through Fire and Water (2013), which tells the story of HMS Ardent during the Falklands conflict, states that operational Stingray torpedoes were transferred to the ship immediately prior to its sailing date of 19 April 1982 under conditions of great secrecy (pp. 56, 61). It is propelled by a pump jet driven by an electric motor. Power is supplied by a magnesium/silver-chloride sea water battery. The propulsion method combines high speed, deep diving, agility and low noise levels. The weapon is provided with target and environmental information by the launching platform. Once launched it operates autonomously, with tactical software searching for the target using active sonar and then homing in without any further assistance. The software is designed to deal with the employment of countermeasures by the target. The weapon is designed to be launched from fixed wing or rotary winged aircraft and surface ships against submarine targets.\n\nThe development of the torpedo cost \u00a3920 million. The Mark 24 Tigerfish submarine-launched torpedo had also overshot its initial budget.\n\nOperators\n\nCurrent operators\n\nRoyal Navy\n\nRoyal Norwegian Navy\n\nRoyal Thai Navy\n\nRomanian Navy\n\nRoyal Moroccan Navy\n\nSpecifications\n Length: \n Diameter: \n Weight: \n Warhead:  of HE in a shaped charge\n Speed: \n Range: \n Depth: \n Propulsion: Magnesium/silver chloride seawater battery (Pump-jet)\n Guidance  Active/Passive sonar\n\nDimensions\nSting Ray has a diameter of  and a length of around . It has a launch weight of , and carries a  Torpex warhead. It has a speed of  over a range of . The increased diameter compared to the US/NATO standard of , meant that RN ships equipped with STWS-1 torpedo tubes designed for the Mark 46 torpedo couldn't fire Sting Ray. Only ships fitted/refitted with the larger STWS-2 or Magazine Torpedo Weapon System can use it.\n\nSting Ray Mod 1 is intended for use against the same targets as Sting Ray Mod 0 but with an enhanced capability against small clad conventional submarines via a shaped-charge insensitive explosive warhead from TDW, and an improved shallow-water performance. It shares many hull components with the original weapon.\n\nSee also\n APR-3E torpedo - Russian equivalent\n A244-S - Italian equivalent\n Mark 54 Lightweight Torpedo - US Navy's equivalent\n MU90 Impact - French/Italian equivalent\n TAL Shyena - Indian equivalent\n Yu-7 torpedo - Chinese equivalent\n K745 Chung Sang Eo - South Korean equivalent\n Type 97 light weight torpedo (G-RX4) - Japanese equivalent\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Royal Navy\n Royal Air Force\n BAE Systems\n Photo of Sting Ray torpedo\n Photo of British Mk 30 torpedo\n Drag Reduction Experiments for Sting Ray, 1968 - 1971\n Norway order Sting Ray mod 1 for frigates, helicopters\n\nNaval weapons of the Cold War\nNaval weapons of the United Kingdom\nTorpedoes of the United Kingdom\nAerial torpedoes\nWeapons and ammunition introduced in 1983\nGeneral Electric Company\nBAE Systems weapons systems", "Hon.

It can be considered a precursor to the operating system.  The name is derived from a program which is always present in the computer's memory, thus being \"resident\". Because memory was very limited on those systems, the resident monitor was often little more than a stub that would gain control at the end of a job and load a non-resident portion to perform required job cleanup and setup tasks.\n\nOn a general-use computer using punched card input, the resident monitor governed the machine before and after each job control card was executed, loaded and interpreted each control card, and acted as a job sequencer for batch processing operations.  The resident monitor could clear memory from the last used program (with the exception of itself), load programs, search for program data and maintain standard input-output routines in memory.\n\nSimilar system software layers were typically in use in the early days of the later minicomputers and microcomputers before they gained the power to support full operating systems.\n\nCurrent use \nResident monitor functionality is present in many embedded systems, boot loaders, and various embedded command lines. The original functions present in all resident monitors are augmented with present-day functions dealing with boot time hardware, disks, ethernet, wireless controllers, etc. Typically, these functions are accessed using a serial terminal or a physical keyboard and display, if attached. Such a resident monitor is frequently called a debugger, boot loader, command-line interface (CLI), etc. The original meaning of serial-accessed or terminal-accessed resident monitor is not frequently used, although the functionality remained the same, and was augmented.\n\nTypical functions of a resident monitor include examining and editing ram and/or ROM (including flash EEPROM) and sometimes special function registers, the ability to jump into code at a specified address, the ability to call code at a given address, the ability to fill an address range with a constant such as 0x00, and several others.  More advanced functions include local disassembly to processor assembly language instructions, and even assembly and writing into flash memory from code typed by the operator. Also, code can be downloaded and uploaded from various sources, and some advanced monitors support tftp, ftp, http etc. networking as well as formatting and reading FAT and other filesystems, typically from flash attached memory on USB or CFcard buses.\n\nFor embedded processors, many \"in-circuit debuggers\" with software-only mode use resident monitor concepts and functions that are frequently accessed by a GUI IDE. They are not different from the traditionally serial line accessed resident monitor command lines, but users are not aware of this. At the latest, developers and advanced users will discover these low level embedded resident monitor functions when writing low level API code on a host to communicate with an embedded target for debugging and code test case running.\n\nSeveral current microcontrollers have resident serial monitors or extended boot loaders available as options to be used by developers. Many are open source. Some examples are PAULMON2, AVR DebugMonitor and the Bamo128 Arduino boot loader and monitor. In general, most current resident monitors for embedded computing can be compiled according to various memory constraints, from small and minimalistic, to large, filling up to 25% of the code space available on an AVR ATmega328 processor with 32 kilobytes of flash memory, for example.\n\nIn many cases resident monitors can be a step up from \"printf debugging\" and are very helpful when developing on a budget that does not allow a proper hardware in-circuit debugger (ICD) to be used.\n\nExamples for systems with resident monitors\nGM-NAA I/O\n\nSee also\nInput/Output Control System\nTerminate-and-stay-resident program\n\nReferences\n\nHistory of software\nSystem software", "Pordenone Calcio, commonly referred to as Pordenone, is a professional football club based in Pordenone, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Italy. It currently plays in .\n\nHistory\nIt was founded in 1920 as Football Club Pordenone.\n\nIn the 2007\u201308 season the club was promoted from Eccellenza Friuli\u00a0\u2013 Venezia Giulia to Serie D, and six seasons later (in 2014) it was promoted to the new Lega Pro. The club was relegated in 2015 but re-admitted at the start of 2015\u201316 Lega Pro, to fill the vacancies.\n\nThe club reached the Lega Pro play-offs for two seasons in a row, being defeated in the semi-finals by Pisa and Parma, the clubs that eventually got promoted.\n\nOn 12 December 2017, in the Round of 16, Pordenone played Inter Milan for the Coppa Italia at the San Siro, drawing 0-0, and getting knocked out 5\u20134 in penalties. This is the farthest the team has ever reached in the competition.\n\nPordenone successively won the Group B title in the 2018\u201319 Serie C season under the tenure of seasoned manager Attilio Tesser, thus ensuring themselves the right to play Serie B for the first time in the club's history.\n\nThe club's first season in Serie B was largely successful, achieving a fourth-place finish in the league and thus reached the play-offs for promotion to Serie A. However, Pordenone's push for a second-consecutive promotion was ended with a 2-1 aggregate defeat in the semi-final against Frosinone. In the 2020-21 season, Pordenone suffered a downturn in fortunes as the club ended the campaign in 15th position in the table, with Tesser being removed from his position as coach in April 2021 and replaced by Maurizio Domizzi.

Human genetics encompasses a variety of overlapping fields including: classical genetics, cytogenetics, molecular genetics, biochemical genetics, genomics, population genetics, developmental genetics, clinical genetics, and genetic counseling.\n\nGenes are the common factor of the qualities of most human-inherited traits. Study of human genetics can answer questions about human nature, can help understand diseases and the development of effective  treatment and help us to understand the genetics of human life. This article describes only basic features of human genetics; for the genetics of disorders please see: medical genetics.\n\nGenetic differences and inheritance patterns \n\nInheritance of traits for humans are based upon Gregor Mendel's model of inheritance. Mendel deduced that inheritance depends upon discrete units of inheritance, called factors or genes.\n\nAutosomal dominant inheritance \nAutosomal traits are associated with a single gene on an autosome (non-sex chromosome)\u2014they are called \"dominant\" because a single copy\u2014inherited from either parent\u2014is enough to cause this trait to appear. This often means that one of the parents must also have the same trait, unless it has arisen due to an unlikely new mutation. Examples of autosomal dominant traits and disorders are Huntington's disease and achondroplasia.\n\nAutosomal recessive inheritance \n\nAutosomal recessive traits is one pattern of inheritance for a trait, disease, or disorder to be passed on through families. For a recessive trait or disease to be displayed two copies of the trait or disorder needs to be presented. The trait or gene will be located on a non-sex chromosome. Because it takes two copies of a trait to display a trait, many people can unknowingly be carriers of a disease. From an evolutionary perspective, a recessive disease or trait can remain hidden for several generations before displaying the phenotype. Examples of autosomal recessive disorders are albinism, cystic fibrosis.\n\nX-linked and Y-linked inheritance \nX-linked genes are found on the sex X chromosome. X-linked genes just like autosomal genes have both dominant and recessive types. Recessive X-linked disorders are rarely seen in females and usually only affect males. This is because males inherit their X chromosome and all X-linked genes will be inherited from the maternal side. Fathers only pass on their Y chromosome to their sons, so no X-linked traits will be inherited from father to son. Men cannot be carriers for recessive X linked traits, as they only have one X chromosome, so any X linked trait inherited from the mother will show up.\n\nFemales express X-linked disorders when they are homozygous for the disorder and become carriers when they are heterozygous. X-linked dominant inheritance will show the same phenotype as a heterozygote and homozygote. Just like X-linked inheritance, there will be a lack of male-to-male inheritance, which makes it distinguishable from autosomal traits. One example of an X-linked trait is Coffin\u2013Lowry syndrome, which is caused by a mutation in ribosomal protein gene. This mutation results in skeletal, craniofacial abnormalities, mental retardation, and short stature.\n\nX chromosomes in females undergo a process known as X inactivation. X inactivation is when one of the two X chromosomes in females is almost completely inactivated. It is important that this process occurs otherwise a woman would produce twice the amount of normal X chromosome proteins. The mechanism for X inactivation will occur during the embryonic stage. For people with disorders like trisomy X, where the genotype has three X chromosomes, X-inactivation will inactivate all X chromosomes until there is only one X chromosome active. Males with Klinefelter syndrome, who have an extra X chromosome, will also undergo X inactivation to have only one completely active X chromosome.\n\nY-linked inheritance occurs when a gene, trait, or disorder is transferred through the Y chromosome. Since Y chromosomes can only be found in males, Y linked traits are only passed on from father to son. The testis determining factor, which is located on the Y chromosome, determines the maleness of individuals. Besides the maleness inherited in the Y-chromosome there are no other found Y-linked characteristics.\n\nPedigrees analysis \n\nA pedigree is a diagram showing the ancestral relationships and transmission of genetic traits over several generations in a family. Square symbols are almost always used to represent males, whilst circles are used for females. Pedigrees are used to help detect many different genetic diseases. A pedigree can also be used to help determine the chances for a parent to produce an offspring with a specific trait.\n\nFour different traits can be identified by pedigree chart analysis: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, x-linked, or y-linked. Partial penetrance can be shown and calculated from pedigrees. Penetrance is the percentage expressed frequency with which individuals of a given genotype manifest at least some degree of a specific mutant phenotype associated with a trait.\n\nInbreeding, or mating between closely related organisms, can clearly be seen on pedigree charts. Pedigree charts of royal families often have a high degree of inbreeding, because it was customary and preferable for royalty to marry another member of royalty. Genetic counselors commonly use pedigrees to help couples determine if the parents will be able to produce healthy children.\n\nKaryotype \n\nA karyotype is a very useful tool in cytogenetics. A karyotype is picture of all the chromosomes in the metaphase stage arranged according to length and centromere position. A karyotype can also be useful in clinical genetics, due to its ability to diagnose genetic disorders. On a normal karyotype, aneuploidy can be detected by clearly being able to observe any missing or extra chromosomes.\n\nGiemsa banding, g-banding, of the karyotype can be used to detect deletions, insertions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. G-banding will stain the chromosomes with light and dark bands unique to each chromosome. A FISH, fluorescent in situ hybridization, can be used to observe deletions, insertions, and translocations. FISH uses fluorescent probes to bind to specific sequences of the chromosomes that will cause the chromosomes to fluoresce a unique color.\n\nGenomics \n\nGenomics is the field of genetics concerned with structural and functional studies of the genome. A genome is all the DNA contained within an organism or a cell including nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. The human genome is the total collection of genes in a human being contained in the human chromosome, composed of over three billion nucleotides. In April 2003, the Human Genome Project was able to sequence all the DNA in the human genome, and to discover that the human genome was composed of around 20,000 protein coding genes.\n\nMedical genetics\n\nMedical genetics is the branch of medicine that involves the diagnosis and management of hereditary disorders.  Medical genetics is the application of genetics to medical care.  It overlaps human genetics, for example, research on the causes and inheritance of genetic disorders would be considered within both human genetics and medical genetics, while the diagnosis, management, and counseling of individuals with genetic disorders would be considered part of medical genetics.\n\nPopulation genetics \n\nPopulation genetics is the branch of evolutionary biology responsible for investigating processes that cause changes in allele and genotype frequencies in populations based upon Mendelian inheritance. Four different forces can influence the frequencies: natural selection, mutation, gene flow (migration), and genetic drift. A population can be defined as a group of interbreeding individuals and their offspring. For human genetics the populations will consist only of the human species. The Hardy\u2013Weinberg principle is a widely used principle to determine allelic and genotype frequencies.\n\nMitochondrial DNA \nIn addition to nuclear DNA, humans (like almost all eukaryotes) have mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria, the \"power houses\" of a cell, have their own DNA. Mitochondria are inherited from one's mother, and their DNA is frequently used to trace maternal lines of descent (see mitochondrial Eve). Mitochondrial DNA is only 16kb in length and encodes for 62 genes.\n\nGenes and sex \n\nThe XY sex-determination system is the sex-determination system found in humans, most other mammals, some insects (Drosophila), and some plants (Ginkgo). In this system, the sex of an individual is determined by a pair of sex chromosomes (gonosomes). Females have two of the same kind of sex chromosome (XX), and are called the homogametic sex. Males have two distinct sex chromosomes (XY), and are called the heterogametic sex.\n\nX-linked traits \n\nSex linkage is the phenotypic expression of an allele related to the chromosomal sex of the individual. This mode of inheritance is in contrast to the inheritance of traits on autosomal chromosomes, where both sexes have the same probability of inheritance. Since humans have many more genes on the X than the Y, there are many more X-linked traits than Y-linked traits.\nHowever, females carry two or more copies of the X chromosome, resulting in a potentially toxic dose of X-linked genes.\n\nTo correct this imbalance, mammalian females have evolved a unique mechanism of dosage compensation.  In particular, by way of the process called X-chromosome inactivation (XCI), female mammals transcriptionally silence one of their two Xs in a complex and highly coordinated manner.\n\nHuman traits with possible monogenic or oligogenic inheritance patterns\n\nDisabling conditions \nGenetic\nChromosomal\n\nSee also \n\n Human evolutionary genetics\n Human genome\n List of Mendelian traits in humans\n Johns Hopkins Human Genetics Program\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n \n *\n\nExternal links \n Human Genome Project\n How many Genes do humans have?\n Human Genetics Video (website critique)\n MITOMAP A human mitochondrial genome database", "The United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) is a United Nations committee whose main task is to review and foster international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, as well as to consider legal issues arising from the exploration of outer space.\n\nThe committee currently has 95 members who meet annually in Vienna, Austria at the Vienna International Centre in June. Additionally, the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee tends to meet in February, while the Legal Subcommittee usually meets in April.\n\nHistory \nThe UN's interest in the peaceful uses of outer space was first expressed in 1957, soon after the launching of the first Sputnik. Its main concern was that space should be used for peaceful purposes and that the benefits from space activities be shared by all nations. Thus, on 13 December 1958, the General Assembly created an ad hoc Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space composed of 18 members who were tasked with reporting to the Assembly about the activities and resources of the UN, its specialized agencies and other international bodies relating to the peaceful uses of outer space.\n\nThe next year, on 12 December 1959, the ad hoc committee was established as a permanent body by the General Assembly with its membership being further increased to 24. It retained the same mission of its predecessor \u2013 to review international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space.\n\nAs the subsequent Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union heightened, the international community quickly became concerned that space could be used for military purposes. As a result of disagreements between the US and the USSR, the committee did not meet again until March 1962 after the General Assembly compelled it to via Resolution 1721 (XVI). The committee's two subcommittees also met in May and June to discuss scientific, technical and legal questions. These subcommittees were in unanimity with respect to various scientific and technical questions while failing to come to an agreement on legal questions.\n\nResolution 1721 also further cemented the committee's role in preserving space for peaceful purposes. It stated that international law and the UN Charter applied in outer space and directed the committee to study and report on legal problems arising from space exploration. It directed all states to inform the committee of all launches into space for the UN's public registry. It directed the committee to keep close contact with governmental and non-governmental organizations concerned with space matters, as well as to act as an exchange of information relating to space activities. Finally, it directed the committee to review reports of the World Meteorological Organization and the International Telecommunication Union in regard to outer space activities relating to weather research and analysis and telecommunication and to submit its comments and recommendations on these reports to the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly. Thus the committee aimed to prevent space from becoming a new frontier for conflict. This gave the committee the unique position of acting as a platform for maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes at the international level.\n\nThe United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) has acted as the secretariat to the committee since its creation in 1958. It also provides secretariat services to the committee's subcommittees. All documents related to the committee and its subcommittees are published by UNOOSA.\n\nTreaties and agreements\n\nCOPUOS oversees the implementation of five UN treaties and agreements relating to activities in outer space:\n \"Outer Space Treaty\" \u2013 The Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies\n \"Rescue Agreement\" \u2013 The Agreement on the Rescue of Astronauts, the Return of Astronauts and the Return of Objects Launched into Outer Space\n \"Liability Convention\" \u2013 The Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects\n \"Registration Convention\" \u2013 The Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space\n \"Moon Treaty\" \u2013 The Agreement Governing the Activities of States on the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies\n\nCOPUOS also keeps track of the following other international agreements relating to activities in outer space:\nGeneral\n Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space, and Under Water (NTB)\n Convention Relating to the Distribution of Programme\u2013Carrying Signals Transmitted by Satellite (BRS)\nInstitutions\n Agreement relating to the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization (ITSO)\n Agreement on the establishment of the International System and Organization of Space Communications (INTERSPUTNIK)\n Convention for the establishment of a European Space Agency (ESA)\n Agreement of the Arab Corporation for Space Communications (ARABSAT)\n Agreement on Cooperation in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space for Peaceful Purposes (INTERCOSMOS)\n Convention on the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO)\n Convention establishing the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (EUTELSAT)\n Convention for the establishment of a European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT)\n International Telecommunication Constitution and Convention (ITU)\n\nNear-Earth object deflection and disaster response \n\nThe Association of Space Explorers (ASE), working in conjunction with B612 Foundation members, helped obtain UN oversight of near-Earth object (NEO) tracking and deflection missions through COPUOS along with its Action Team 14 (AT-14) expert group. Several members of B612 and ASE have worked with COPUOS since 2001 to establish international involvement for both impact disaster responses, and on deflection, missions to prevent impact events. As explained by B612 Foundation Chair Emeritus Rusty Schweickart in 2013, \"No government in the world today has explicitly assigned the responsibility for planetary protection to any of its agencies\".\n\nIn October 2013, the UN committee approved several measures to deal with terrestrial asteroid impacts, including the creation of an International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) to act as a clearinghouse for shared information on dangerous asteroids and for any future terrestrial impact events that are identified. A UN Space Missions Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG) will also coordinate joint studies of the technologies for deflection missions, and as well provide oversight of actual missions. This is due to deflection missions typically involving a progressive movement of an asteroid's predicted impact point across the surface of the Earth (and also across the territories of uninvolved countries) until the NEO has been deflected either ahead of, or behind the planet at the point their orbits intersect. Schweickart states that an initial framework of international cooperation at the UN is needed to guide the policymakers of its member nations on several important NEO-related aspects.\n\nAt about the same time (Oct 2013) of the UN's policy adoption in New York City, Schweickart and four other ASE member, including B612 head Ed Lu and strategic advisers Dumitru Prunariu and Tom Jones, participated at a public forum moderated by Neil deGrasse Tyson not far from the UN's headquarters, urging the global community to adopt further important steps towards planetary defense against the threat of NEO impacts. Their recommendations included:\n UN delegates briefing their home countries' policymakers on the UN's newest roles,\n having each country's government create defined asteroid disaster response plans, assigning fiscal resources to deal with asteroid impacts, and delegating a lead agency to handle its disaster response in order to create clear lines of communication from the IAWN to the affected countries,\n having their governments support the ASE's and B612's efforts to identify \"city-killer\" NEOs capable of impacting Earth, estimated at a million, by deploying a space-based asteroid telescope, and\n committing member states to launching an international test deflection mission within 10 years.\n\nThe first meetings of IAWN and SMPAG were held in 2014.\n\nMember states\n\nThe committee was first established by the General Assembly in its resolution 1348 (XIII) of 13 December 1958 and was originally composed of 18 members. It has grown to include 92 members , and is subsequently one of the largest committees of the General Assembly of the United Nations. The evolution of the composition of the committee is as follows:\n\nPermanent observers \nIn addition to the committee's member states, a number of international organizations, including both intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, have observer status with COPUOS and its subcommittees. The following is a list of the committee's observers, with the year they were granted that status:\n\nBureau \nThe following is the Bureau of the committee for its 65th Session, which ran from 1\u201310 June 2020.

The spelling of her first name was a compromise after she was born,  because her parents had been expecting a boy. They had chosen \"Frank\" as the name, but it no longer seemed appropriate. Her mother did not favor \"Frances\" as a compromise, so they settled on \"Franc\", pronounced the same as \"Frank\".\n\nHale played piano from an early age, and when she was 5 years old, one of her performances led to Tacoma newspapers commenting on her talents as a prodigy. She graduated from Miss Hansom's School for Girls, and her performances in school plays developed her desire to be an actress. Her parents, however, wanted her to be a writer, so she had to change their minds. \"I finally convinced them\", she said, \"that in order to write plays I should have some working knowledge of the stage\".\n\nCareer\nHale's early acting experience came in stock theater, beginning in Portland and later touring in a production of Ma Pettingill with a company headed by May Robson, who had seen Hale perform in a school program, leading to Hale's debut as a professional. By age 22, she had played 50 roles on stage, with the characters' ages ranging from 12 to 60. For more than five years, she was the leading lady with Walker Whiteside's theatrical company.\n\nHale's Broadway credits include The Arabian (1927), The Royal Box (1928), Sakura (1928, Three Men and a Woman (1932), and Late Wisdom (1934). On radio, Hale played Dale Arden on The Amazing Interplanetary Adventures of Flash Gordon, Annette Rogers on John's Other Wife and Shanghai Lil on Jungle Jim. She also was featured on Second Husband, Aunt Jenny, Our Gal Sunday, and Young Doctor Malone.\n\nPersonal life and death\nHale was married to screenwriter Frank Gabrielson. She died on June 10, 1986, in Santa Monica, California.\n\nReferences \n\n1900s births\n1986 deaths\n20th-century American actresses\nActresses from Tacoma, Washington\nAmerican radio actresses\nAmerican soap opera actresses\nAmerican stage actresses\nBroadway theatre people", "Marwitzia is a genus of moths of the family Crambidae.\n\nSpecies\nMarwitzia centiguttalis Gaede, 1917\nMarwitzia costinigralis Maes, 1998\nMarwitzia dichocrocis (Hampson, 1913)\n\nFormer species\nMarwitzia polystidzalis (Hampson, 1918)\n\nReferences\nGaede, 1917.

He is the protagonist of Toei's 1978 Spider-Man television series, subsequently reappearing as a supporting character in the 2014\u20132015 Spider-Verse and 2018 Spider-Geddon comic storylines, and in the animated film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023).\n\nThe success of Yamashiro and his giant mecha robot Leopardon made Toei adapt the concept to their Super Sentai franchise in Battle Fever J, ultimately making the character the narrative-forefather of the Power Rangers.\n\nCharacter development and execution \n\nThe Takuya Yamashiro incarnation of Spider-Man is drastically different from the traditional Marvel Comics version, with the former sharing the same name, costume, and primary superpowers.\n\nThe series greatly influenced later Tokusatsu series and anime series, as Yamashiro's series introduced the concept of a superhero summoning a giant robot to fight an enlarged enemy for them. While series about heroes with a giant robot have been around prior to Yamashiro, it had yet to be combined with a superhero who also fights enemies himself. As a result, it became a permanent staple of the Super Sentai franchise beginning with Battle Fever J.\n\nFictional character biography \nTakuya Yamashiro was a motocross driver, son of the astrophysicist Dr. Hiroshi Yamashiro, and the man who would become his reality's Spider-Man. Whilst practicing on his motorbike, Takuya began to receive telepathic messages from an alien called Garia, who had been imprisoned in a cave by a vampiric warlord called Professor Monster. His sister, Shinko and girlfriend, Hitomi Sakuma asked for his assistance in investigating the crashed Leopardon but Takuya refused as he had a race to compete in. His father, who had been searching for Garia, accepted this and set out with Shinko and Hitomi. Later, before leaving for the contest, Takuya received more messages from Garia and went to investigate. In the mountains he found Hitomi and Shinko who told Takuya their father had been attacked. Takuya found his dying father, who had received fatal injuries from a creature working for Professor Monster called Boukunryu. After his father died, Takuya was attacked by the Iron Cross Army and gravely injured and he fell into the cave where Garia was imprisoned. Garia saved his life by giving him the Spider Bracelet and Spider Extract, which granted him spider-like abilities, and he then informed Takuya of the invasion of Professor Monster, as well as his personal history. Back at his house, Garia told Takuya of his new costume and abilities and tested them out, before discovering the Iron Cross Army had kidnapped Professor Fujita. Spider-Man set out to confront the group and freed the Professor. He was then attacked by Boukunryu and found himself unable to defeat the monster, until he summoned Leopardon and unleashed its Sword Vigor and destroyed Boukunryu, vowing to defeat the rest of the Iron Cross Army.\n\nAfter defeating Boukunryu, Yamashiro continued to operate as a superhero after heading a message from his father's diary which read 'always take responsibility for your actions'. After joining Interpol, he eventually confronted and seemingly killed Professor Monster, finally avenging his father's death. He also gave a young orphaned boy named Ichiro Murakami superpowers after a blood transfusion.\n\nComic appearances\n\nSpider-Verse and Spider-Geddon \n\nDuring the \"Spider-Verse\" storyline, Takuya was brought from Earth-51778 into the war against the Inheritors by Earth-616's Spider-Man and Spider-Girl, as well as Earth-65's Spider-Woman. As soon as the group arrived in their former safe zone, Earth-13, Takuya, who was already piloting the Leopardon, faced off against Solus, but the villain made quick work of the giant robot. Luckily, Takuya managed to escape the confrontation alive and join the rest of the spiders. Takuya stayed with the group of Spiders and during the final battle in Loomworld, he was reunited with Leopardon. Spider-Man 2099 and Lady Spider managed to fix the robot with \"some future tech and some steam-power\". After the Inheritors' defeat, Takuya safely returned to his world.\n\nTakuya remained on Planet Spider, where he had lived in a traditional Japanese house, and allowed Spider-Zero to stay with him until Miles came. Soon after, Spider-Zero and Miles began their journey to repair the multiverse.\n\nThe Machine Bem Monsters that were created to stop Takuya attacked the new team of Spider-Men, and Takuya came through a portal from Planet Spider along with Leopardon. He participated in the final battle, and was later sent back to his home universe by Spiderling.\n\nDuring the \"Spider-Geddon\" storyline, Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in a Proto-Clone body) and Spider-Man of Earth-1048 warn Takuya that the Inheritors have escaped. He talks with the alternate Spider-Men on how to defeat the Inheritors. He allows Superior Spider-Man to analyze the Multiverse to find new recruits to help fight the Inheritors like a Spider-Cop and a Tyrannosaurus. During the Spider-Army's attack on the Inheritors who are using the abandoned New U Technologies as a base, Takuya starts to have Leopardon transform until he is attacked by Daemos. When Miles Morales became the latest Captain Universe, he used Leopardon's sword to attack Solus, Brix, Bora, and Daemos.\n\nPowers and abilities\nHis powers include superhuman strength, speed, accelerated healing, being able to cling to most surfaces, heightened eyesight, and X-ray vision. He ages slower than regular humans, and is a skilled practitioner of ninjitsu. He also has the ability to communicate with spiders, and like many other versions of Spider-Man, he possesses a spider-sense which warns him of danger, in addition to having precognitive dreams. Similarly, he also uses his Spider Bracelet to shoot webs and nets, with the device also being able to magnetically unlock doors, identify aliens in disguise, and deflect lasers. The Spider Bracelet vanishes when it is not in use, in addition to being able to produce a spare version of his costume if his original is damaged. His powers can be transferred to other people via a blood transfusion.\n\nIn other media\n\nFilm\n Takuya Yamashiro and Leopardon will appear in the upcoming film Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.\n\nMerchandise\n Takuya Yamashiro was released as an S.H.Figuarts action figure in 2020.\n A Takuya Yamashiro Funko Pop Vinyl figure was released as a Previews exclusive in 2021, with a second Funko Pop Vinyl figure bundled with a soda drink becoming available in 2022. \n Takuya Yamashiro was released as a Marvel Legends action figure in 2022, as part of Marvel Legends Beyond Amazing wave.\n A Nendoroid figure of Takuya Yamashiro was released in February 2022.\n\nMiscellaneous\n Apart from the costume and powers of the main character, this TV series is unrelated to Ryoichi Ikegami's earlier manga adaptation of Spider-Man or the original Spider-Man comics. However, several manga adaptations of the Toei version were published by different magazines, such as TV Land, Tanosh\u012b Y\u014dchien, TV Magazine, and B\u014dken'\u014d.\n A version of Spider-Man's giant robot, Leopardon, appears in the Ernest Cline novel Ready Player One.\n\nSee also \n Spider-Man in television\n Spider-Man in film\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nAlternative versions of Spider-Man\nFictional characters from parallel universes\nFictional characters from Tokyo\nFictional characters with precognition\nFictional characters with superhuman durability or invulnerability\nFictional characters with superhuman senses\nFictional Ninjutsu practitioners\nFictional photographers\nFictional racing drivers\nFictional vigilantes\nMale characters in television\nMarvel Comics characters who can move at superhuman speeds\nMarvel Comics characters with accelerated healing\nMarvel Comics characters with superhuman strength\nMarvel Comics martial artists\nMarvel Comics mutates \nJapanese superheroes\nSpider-Man characters\nSpider-Man in television\nSuperhero television characters\nTelevision characters introduced in 1978\nTransforming heroes", "Constituency NA-140 (Kasur-III) () was a constituency for the National Assembly of Pakistan.

Groeschel's non-traditional style was successful and attendance of Life Covenant grew rapidly, eventually evolving to become the largest Protestant church in the United States with 44 physical Life.Church locations as of 2022. Groeschel began using video to deliver some of his sermons, when his fourth child was born in 2001, and he was unavailable for the Sunday service, discovering that the videos were popular with his churchgoers. In 2006, he set up a website called Mysecret.tv as a place for people to confess anonymously on the Internet.

It is surrounded by the Kumaradhara River on one side and Nethravathi River on the other. When the town's two surrounding rivers rise during the rainy season and meet, this is called the \"Sangam\" which is a Sanskrit word for confluence. The Sangam is a major event as people from the surrounding villages crowd the river banks to witness the merge. The population of Uppinangady is 7,172.\n\nIn 1923 the town of Uppinangady was washed out due to excessive flooding, and its courts were moved to Puttur. Severe flooding also occurred in 1974. \nUppinangady was previously the Taluk Headquarters, but due to the issue of heavy flooding during the monsoon, the taluk centre was moved to Puttur.\nUppinangady is the 2nd largest urban area in Puttur Taluk.\n\nThe town of Uppinangady is situated at an altitude of 53 meters. Uppinangady is also known as \"Dakshina Kashi\". It is believed that there is also a sangam of a third river along with the other two rivers which is known as Guptagamini. It is famous for the Sahasralingeshwara Temple\n\nGovernance\nUppinangady Village is Administered by Grama Panchayat. The area under the Uppinangadi Gram Panchayat's jurisdiction is roughly 10 km. It has six wards with a total membership of 20 people.\nAccording to the 2011 Census, there are 1544 families and 7813 people living in the Town overall, including 3901 men and 3912 women.\nUppinangady Gram Panchayat is part of the Puttur Taluk Panchayat and the Dakshina Kannada Zilla Panchayat Constituency.\nUppinangady village has 4 temples, 3 mosques, 1 church, 6 madrasas, and 2 bhajan mandirs. There is one primary health centre, nine schools, two colleges, and ten Anganwadi Centers, Village Development Project Self Help Group,JCI, Rotary Club, 8 Asha Workers, 2 Fair Price Shops, Primary Agriculture Self Help Group are all under the jurisdiction of Gram Panchayat and work together for the development of the Village.\nUppinangady is the major commercial hub for Shiradi to Kodimbadi in the Puttur taluk, Ramakunja, Alankaru, Biliyur to Perne in the Bantwal taluk, and more than 6 grama panchayats in the Belthangadi taluk. Uppinangady is also passed by the national highway that runs between Mangalore and Bangalore. Due to all of these factors, Uppinangady is a thriving business centre.\nUppinangadi Gram Panchayat's own grant includes not only house tax but also income from business license of around 700 shops in the town and rent of panchayat buildings. \nOfficial Website of Uppinangady Grama Panchayat:  http://uppinangadigp.com/\n\nHistory\nIts legend dates back to the time of Mahabharata. The Skanda Purana states that when King Yudhisthira decided to perform the Rajasuya Yagna (to proclaim his sovereignty), he sent Bhima to present day Uppinangady. There, he was attacked by the huge giant animal named Purusha Mruga. To avoid attack, he dropped one of his hairs, which instantly turned into a Shivalinga. Seeing this, Purusha Mruga stopped to worship the Linga & then proceeded to attack. Bhima again dropped a hair, which turned into another Shivalinga. This happened for quite sometime. Finally, he dropped a handful of his hair, which instantly turned into a thousand Shivalingas. Purusha Mruga stopped to worship all the Lingas, giving time to escape. The Sangama (confluence) of Kumaradhara & Netravati rivers happen near the temple. However, during the monsoon, this confluence takes place directly in front of the sanctum sanctorum. It is considered an auspicious moment to bathe in the rivers' waters. It is also said that the 1000 Shivalingas, hidden deep in the sand, are revealed when the sand recedes.\n\nTransport\nUppinangady is at the foothills of the Western Ghats in Dakhshina Kannada district, surrounded by forests. Uppinangady lies on National Highway 75 which connects Mangaluru to Bengaluru. There are frequent bus and taxi service from this place to Mangaluru and its taluk headquarters Puttur and also to Kukke Subramanya.\nThe nearest railway station is Puttur Railway station located at a distance of 12\u00a0km. The nearest airport is Mangalore International airport 55\u00a0km away.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/19/Uppinangadi.html\n Herald A.

It would have carried light crude oil from the Bakken oil fields in Northwest North Dakota, through Minnesota, to end in Superior, Wisconsin. Enbridge Energy Partners, and Williston Basin Pipe Line LLC, an indirect subsidiary of Marathon Petroleum Corporation had planned the project since 2013. In 2015 Enbridge estimated the pipeline will cost about $2.6 billion. \n\nIn 2016, Enbridge announced the cancellation of the pipeline, their withdrawal of their state application and their request to end an environmental impact statement and regulatory proceedings.\n\nHistory\nThe Sandpiper pipeline project was made public by the media in 2013, and informational hearings for landowners took place in three North Dakota towns in March 2014. The North Dakota Public Service Commission approved the pipeline in June 2014. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission unanimously approved the Sandpiper pipeline, but its decision was overturned in September 2015.\n\nIn September 2016, Enbridge Energy Partners announced that due to \"extensive and unprecedented [regulatory] delays [which] have plagued the Sandpiper pipeline,\" they were withdrawing their state application and asking for an end to regulatory proceedings, including work on an environmental-impact statement. An Enbridge spokesperson said that the pipeline may be reconsidered once the oil market rebounds but it was then \"outside the company\u2019s current five-year planning horizon\".\n\nPurpose\nIn 2015, Enbridge stated that \"The Sandpiper Pipeline serves the oil conducting needs of North Dakota residents, which constitutes a public benefit\". Per Enbridge, the Sandpiper pipeline would have represented a \"public use\" as a \"statutorily defined public utility\". According to Enbridge, its route was chosen with the \"greatest public benefit and the least private injury\" and that \"as long as the public benefit can be demonstrated, it is immaterial that private interests are also served.\"\n\nPer Enbridge, the pipeline was necessary \"to meet demand for Bakken oil\".\nThe corporation projects economic benefits of $69 million in property tax revenue for the 3 states, and 3000 construction jobs for workers in Minnesota and North Dakota.\n\nDescription\n\nThe pipeline would have entered Minnesota just south of Grand Forks, North Dakota, east to Clearbrook Enbridge's terminal and then south toward Park Rapids along an existing crude oil corridor. Afterwards, the pipeline would have run along a transmission line corridor to Superior, Wisconsin.\n\nThe route of the pipeline would have travelled through 28\u00a0rivers, including the Mississippi River headwaters, and lakes and wetlands that couldn't be reached by nearby roads when a spill occurs.\n\nNorth Dakota portion\nInformational hearings for landowners took place in three North Dakota towns during March 2014. The North Dakota Public Service Commission approved the pipeline on 25 June 2014.\n\nEnbridge sued a Grand Forks couple in 2014 after they refused to give the Canadian corporation an easement and right-of-way on their property. The couple quoted NDPL's abuse of eminent domain, continued reliance on fossil fuels, their effect on the environment, and the possibility for spills as arguments. In August 2015 the couple agreed to an easement and forfeited compensation, in order to file an appeal to the North Dakota Supreme Court.\n\nMinnesota portion\nIn November 2013, Enbridge applied at the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC).

The station, situated  north-west of Lancaster, serves the village of Arnside in Cumbria. It is owned by Network Rail and managed by Northern Trains.\n\nA short distance west of the station, the railway crosses the River Kent on an impressive 50-span viaduct that is some  long. The historic structure underwent major repairs and refurbishment, including the complete replacement of the rail deck in 2011. Similar work was carried out on the nearby Leven Estuary viaduct in the spring of 2006.\n\nHistory\nOpened on 1 August 1858 by the Ulverstone and Lancaster Railway (a company backed by, and later taken over by the Furness Railway) (FR), the station became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the London Midland Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948.\n\nWhen Sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by Regional Railways until the privatisation of British Rail.\n\nA short branch line to Sandside and Hincaster Junction on the West Coast Main Line once diverged from the main line here, which carried a  to Kendal local service from its opening in 1876 until 1942. In July 1922, this FR service ran five times per day in each direction on weekdays. The branch was also used by mineral trains from County Durham to the Barrow-in-Furness area, allowing them to avoid having to reverse direction at the busy junction at Carnforth. Local freight traffic continued as far as Sandside until final closure of the line in 1972. The disused platform face and trackbed is still visible behind the southbound platform.\n\nFacilities\nWhilst one building remains at the station, it is not in railway use.  Shelters are provided for passengers on both platforms, but the only link between them is via a footbridge with stairs (no step-free access).  Digital information screens, customer help points, timetable posters and automated announcements provide train running details.  As the station is unstaffed, tickets can only be bought from the ticket machine or on the train.\n\nServices\n\nIt is served by stopping trains between  and Barrow, with some continuing to Sellafield or Carlisle via the Cumbrian Coast Line in the northbound direction and by some through services southbound to  and . There is one train per hour in each direction on weekdays, although the varying nature of the stopping patterns of each service means the timetable is irregular.  On Sundays there is a train every hour each way (up from a two-hourly frequency since May 2018).\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n \n \n Station on navigable Ordnance Survey map\n\nExternal links\n\n \n \n\nRailway stations in Cumbria\nDfT Category F2 stations\nFormer Ulverston and Lancaster Railway stations\nRailway stations in Great Britain opened in 1858\nNorthern franchise railway stations\nArnside", "Mily Possoz, sometimes written as Milly (18881968), was a Portuguese artist of Belgian origin. She was one of the most prominent figures of the first generation of Portuguese modernist artists.\n\nEarly life\n\u00c9milia Possoz was born on 4 December 1888, in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, She was the daughter of Henri \u00c9mile Possoz (18561912), a former Belgian army artillery officer and chemical engineer, and Jeanne Anne Rosalie Leroy (18621937), both Belgian citizens, who were born in Antwerp and Li\u00e8ge, respectively and had married in London in early 1888. At this time Portugal was seeking to open eight technical schools to teach industrial education to train qualified technicians for factories in the same vicinity. Her parents moved to Portugal in 1888 when her father was asked to be a professor of Chemistry at the Industrial School situated in Caldas da Rainha in the Leiria District of Portugal, which was close to a ceramics factory managed by the artist Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro. They arrived in Lisbon on 2 December, just two days before \u00c9milia's birth. She was not baptised until 8 June 1889, in the Parish Church of Caldas da Rainha.\n\nAfter a few years the family moved to Lisbon, with her father taking a job as attorney and head of the maritime section in the firm Burnay & C\u00aa, belonging to Henrique Burnay, the Second Count of Burnay, who had become very rich and eventually turned his company into the Burnay Bank. Mily and her sister Jeanne entered the Lisbon German School. After some years of difficulty the school reopened its doors in 1895, when it is likely the two sisters joined. Both had an oral command of the German language as their mother spoke German to them at home. Her father was later to be appointed Chancellor of the Consulate General of Belgium in Lisbon. Well-integrated with the small Belgian community in Lisbon and with the wider Lisbon society, the family got to know artists and other well-known figures, such as the painter Alfredo Roque Gameiro, and the pianists Jos\u00e9 Vianna da Motta and Alexandre Rey Cola\u00e7o. Mily Possoz became particularly friendly with Cola\u00e7o\u2019s daughter, Alice, who also became an artist.\n\nLike the daughters of all upper-middle-class families, the two sisters learned to play the piano. They were students of Alexandre Rey Cola\u00e7o, who was also the teacher of the royal family. They became known for the entertainment they provided to visitors to the family house. During the summers the sisters and their mother returned to Belgium while their father continued to work in Lisbon. Their exposure to the arts continued as their paternal grandfather was a graduate of the Royal Conservatory of Brussels, where he was a professor.  One of his brothers was an engraver by profession and her paternal grandmother was an amateur artist.\n\nEarly art training\nWhile still young, Mily Possoz started attending the studios of watercolor artist Enrique Casanova (18501913), a Spanish naturalist painter and teacher of the Portuguese royal family, and of painter Em\u00edlia dos Santos Braga (18671949), a disciple of Jos\u00e9 Malhoa and a painter who specialised in nudes, much to the horror of the Lisbon middle classes. Braga ran a school of painting, from which Mily Possoz and Maria Helena Vieira da Silva (1908-1992) emerged as her two most famous students. It was with Braga that Possoz first experimented with oil painting.\n\nWhen his daughter was 16, her father contacted the French painter, Ernest Bordes, who had also done work for the Portuguese Royal Family, asking for advice on his daughter's work. The response was very positive, encouraging her father to allow her to continue her artistic training in Paris, where she attended the Acad\u00e9mie de la Grande Chaumi\u00e8re in Montparnasse, a school which aimed to teach art free from the restrictions of an academic education. During her stay she became a student of one of the founders of the Academy, Lucien Simon, and of \u00c9mile-Ren\u00e9 M\u00e9nard, and met artists such as the Portuguese artists Manuel Jardim and Eduardo Viana, who Possoz became engaged to in 1919, as well as Amedeo Modigliani. She began to explore new techniques and to take an interest in new avant-garde artistic movements. Unfortunately, her enjoyment of the bohemian Parisian life proved too much for her tolerant parents and she was recalled home in 1908. Pozzoz later went to D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany, where she took private lessons on engraving and lithography with Willy Spatz and also traveled through Belgium, Italy and Holland.\n\nEarly exhibits\nReturning to Portugal, Possoz divided her time between the Lapa part of Lisbon, almost always in the company of her sister Jeanne and her friend Alice Rey Cola\u00e7o, and the family home in Estoril. Her father died in 1912. After the overthrow of the monarchy and rebelling against the conservatism of Portuguese society and its conventional approach to art, she joined the emerging modernist movement in Portugal. She started to exhibit at the Sociedade Nacional de Belas Artes (Society of Fine Arts) in 1909 and rapidly became known, being a regular exhibitor at the Society's annual salons until 1916. She would also exhibit at the Humourist and Modernist Exhibitions from 1913 to 1926, along with Jos\u00e9 de Almada Negreiros and others. She was one of the few female artists of her generation to organize individual exhibitions of her work, in oil painting, pencil drawing, gouache or watercolour. Invited to participate she was the only female exhibiting in the 2nd Exhibition of Humourists, in 1913, and in the Exhibition of the \"Five Independents\" in 1923. In a male-dominated society, Possoz was regarded as an equal by her fellow artists.\n\nWorld War I and after\nThere was a thriving community of artists in Lisbon during and immediately after World War I. Central to the group were Robert and Sonia Delaunay, who had lived in Paris but were in Spain when war broke out, decided not to return and moved to Lisbon. Others, apart from Possoz, were Sarah Affonso, Almada Negreiros, Helena Viera da Silva, Abel Manta, Clementina Carneiro de Moura, Fernanda de Castro, Estrela Faria and Ant\u00f3nio Soares. In 1922, many of these took up residence in Paris. Possoz paid frequent visits but appears not to have lived permanently in Paris again until 1927.\n\nDuring her visits to France, Possoz became an active member and only female partner of the society Jeune Gravure Contemporaine (Young Contemporary Engraving), which staged annual shows and was influential in keeping the spirit of printmaking alive. She exhibited at museums and galleries and became friends with the Japanese artist Tsuguharu Foujita, with whom she collaborated on some of his lithographs. In Brussels, she exhibited with Gravure Original Belge. In 1922, Possoz was rejected for exhibition by the Portuguese Sociedade Nacional de Belas Artes, due to her criticism of the conservatism and artistic backwardness of the Portuguese artistic society, a rejection that the newspaper Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias considered to be \"an injustice and a scandal\". Outraged, Eduardo Viana, who had never been refused to exhibit, decided to organize an exhibition for modernist artists in 1925, borrowing the name of Autumn Salon from a similar exhibition in Paris. Possoz exhibited several works. In 1926, Viana ended the engagement and left for Brussels. They resumed the relationship two years later but separated again in 1930.\n\nPossoz settled in Paris from 1927 to 1937, occasionally visiting Portugal to exhibit or visit family members. The decision to stay in Paris may have been due to an invitation by the French poet, writer and essayist Val\u00e9ry Larbaud to illustrate one of his books. It appears that most of her work during this period involved book illustrations and that she also obtained income from the sale of prints. Her financial situation was precarious. In 1937 she participated in the Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (International Exposition of Art and Technology in Modern Life) in Paris and won a Gold Medal for engraving, and in the same year exhibited at the French Printmaking Exhibition, held in Cleveland, United States, which led to several of her works being purchased by the Cleveland Museum of Art.\n\nBook illustrations\nWith the loss of her father's income, Possoz had to produce an income from her art. This was mainly achieved by commercial work rather than by selling her paintings. An excellent designer, Possoz collaborated with Jorge Barradas and Alice Rey Cola\u00e7o as a poster and stage designer for the play Zilda by Alfredo Cortez (1921), and as an illustrator in numerous publications, such as the magazines ABC, Athena, Contempor\u00e2nea, Di\u00e1rio de Lisboa, and A Civiliza\u00e7\u00e3o, using woodcutting, lithography, watercolour, etching and drypoint techniques. She also illustrated short stories and novels, such as O Jardim das Mestras (1914) by Manoel de Sousa Pinto, The Adventures of Fel\u00edcio and Felizarda at the North Pole (1922) by Ana de Castro Os\u00f3rio, As Bonecas (1923) by Jane Bensaude, The roses of the baby Jesus (1923) by Maria Benedita Moutinho de Albuquerque Pinho, Theatro para Crean\u00e7as (1923) by Maria Paula Azevedo and a re-issue of Prosper M\u00e9rim\u00e9e\u2019s La Carrosse du Saint Sacrement (1928).\n\nReturn to Portugal\nReturning to Portugal after the death of her mother in 1937, Possoz lived in Sintra. In 1940 she was among many modernist artists invited by the architect Cottinelli Telmo to decorate the pavilions of the Portuguese World Exhibition (Exposi\u00e7\u00e3o do Mundo Portugu\u00eas), which was held in Lisbon in 1940 to mark 800 years since the foundation of the country and 300 years since the restoration of independence from Spain. She was asked to design the Japan Room and her work was inspired by Namban art. During that same decade, she became friends with the Catalan painter and designer Ramon Rogent i Per\u00e9s, and dedicated herself mainly to oil and watercolour painting. She also collaborated occasionally with the magazine Panorama and designed costumes for a ballet. She also participated in several exhibitions of Modern Art. In 1944 she received the Amadeo de Souza Cardoso Award, in 1949 the Jos\u00e9 Tagarro Drawing Prize and in 1951 the Columbano Prize.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, at the invitation of her neighbour and friend Bartolomeu Cid dos Santos, Possoz began to collaborate with the Sociedade Cooperativa de Gravadores Portugueses, of which she remained a member until her death. She began to give private lessons in painting and continued to illustrate books such as Bom Dia Tristeza (1954) by Fran\u00e7oise Sagan and Mascarados and popular masks of Tr\u00e1s-os-Montes (1960) by Sebasti\u00e3o Pessanha. She held her third solo exhibition, exhibited in the city council buildings of Sintra and Almada and also supported young artists to exhibit for the first time in different spaces.\n\nDeath and legacy\nMily Possoz died on 17 June 1968 in Lisbon, at her sister's house. In 1969 the first retrospective exhibition was held in her honour at the exhibition space of the Sociedade Cooperativa de Gravadores Portugueses, in Lisbon. Despite her considerable work employing a variety of different techniques, and her international reputation, she is probably best-known in Portugal for a school book she illustrated in 1958 called Livro da segunda classe, which had a profound impact on students for many years.\n\nHer work can be found in the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon, the National Museum of Contemporary Art in Chiado, Lisbon, the National Gallery of London and the Cleveland Museum, among others. In Portugal she has two roads named after her, in the municipalities of Cascais and Seixal.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n  Calouste Gulbenkian Museum Collection of works by Possoz\n\n1888 births\n1968 deaths\nPortuguese engravers\nPortuguese illustrators\nPortuguese people of Belgian descent\nPortuguese women painters\nPortuguese women illustrators\nWomen engravers", "Dharma Ratna Tuladhar, popularly known as Dharma Ratna Yami () was a Nepalese government deputy minister, activist and Newa language writer\n\nWhile serving eighteen years jail term, he changed his surname from Tuladhar to Yami (meaning an inhabitant of Kathmandu in Nepal Bhasa) and identified himself as Newa. He in the jail to unite and organized communities against the Rana rulers.\n\nEarly life \n\nYami was born to father Bhawani Ratna, son of rich business merchant Late Ratna Das Tuladhar and Mother Devi Maya Tuladhar at Asan Kamalachhi (), Kathmandu. His was an affluent merchant family which was made penniless after the Rana regime confiscated their property. Yami was schooled at home. In 1930, he traveled to Lhasa and worked in the business house of Dharma Man Tuladhar. In Tibet, he came in contact with Mahapandit Rahul Sankrityayan; and under his influence and inspiration, he studied books on various subjects and began writing himself. B. R. Ambedkar was a good friend of late Dharma Ratna Yami. He used to be invited as the chief guest in Ambedkar's programs in India.\n\nPolitical activities and imprisonment \n\nReturning to Kathmandu in 1937, he joined the democracy movement against the autocratic Rana regime. He was arrested in 1940 and sentenced to 18 years in prison and his property was impounded. Following his release after serving five years, he married Heera Devi Kansakar. On 15 August 1947, both Yami and his wife were arrested for organizing a meeting to mark India's independence from Britain. Yami's wife was freed after a few days while he remained in jail for six more months.\n\nIn 1948, he became a founder member of the Nepal Democratic Congress Party which was for overthrowing the Rana regime by any means, including armed uprising. In 1950, it combined with the Nepali National Congress and became the Nepali Congress which launched an armed struggle against the Ranas. Yami was arrested again and spent 16 months behind bars. He was freed in February 1951 after the Rana regime was abolished and democracy established in Nepal.\n\nIn November 1951, the first government in Nepal led by a commoner prime minister was formed, and Yami was appointed Deputy Forest Minister by Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala. According to Koirala, Yami was inducted into the cabinet at the insistence of King Tribhuvan because of his experience in Tibet and social work, and that somebody from the Buddhist community of the Kathmandu Valley should be included in it.\n\nFollowing the political changes in 1960 when parliament was dissolved and political parties were banned, he was put under house arrest for a few months at Shree Mahal. Yami was nominated to the Rastriya Panchayat (legislature) in 1962.\n\nSocial activist \n\nYami was an outspoken nonconformist and challenged the social norms of the day like untouchability. He demanded in Parliament that laws related to caste and ethnicity be scrapped, but the proposal was rejected. In 1969, a year after his wife died, he remarried outside his caste a Bahun woman named Sabitri Devi Dahal. He also hired a woman from a so-called untouchable caste as a cook in his kitchen, an unthinkable act in those days. His radical social and political views have led his contemporaries like missionary Father Marshall D. Moran, SJ to describe him as the most informative and interesting person in Kathmandu. Yami died in Kathmandu in 1975 at the age of 60.\n\nPublications \nYami was a prolific and multilingual writer and has published 21 books including novels, epics and an anthology of poems in Nepal Bhasa, Nepali, English and Hindi. He has been jailed for his writings because the government found them subversive.Notable works:\n\nNepal Bhasa \n Sandey\u0101 Lisah () is an epic about an unfulfilled love affair between a Newar merchant in Lhasa and a Tibetan girl.

He graduated from Trinity College, Dublin with a BA in 1711 and an MA in 1714 and an N.F.P. on 6 July 1740 as Richard Colley. In the intervening year he held the office of Chamberlain of the Court of Exchequer (Ireland).\n\nOn 23 September 1728 Colley inherited the estates of Dangan and Mornington, in County Meath, on the death of his cousin, Garret Wesley. Less than two months later on 15 November 1728 he legally changed his surname to Wesley.\n\nBetween 1729 and 1746 Wesley represented Trim in the Irish House of Commons. He was High Sheriff of Meath in 1734 and he was created Baron Mornington in the Peerage of Ireland on 9 July 1746.\n\nCharacter\nWellington's biographer described his grandfather as \"a civilised and eccentric country gentleman\". The diarist Mary Delany (who was Garret's godmother) visiting Dangan in 1748 after a 17-year gap, found him \"the same good-humoured, agreeable man he was on my last visit\", and praised him as the man with most merits and fewest faults of anyone she knew, valuing wealth only as a means to make others happy. He was proud of, and fostered, his son's musical talent, but he was also extravagant, and died in debt, beginning the cycle of family indebtedness which eventually led to his eldest grandson Richard selling Dangan 40 years later.\n\nFamily\nThe Colley or Cowley family had come to Ireland from Glaston, in Rutland about 1500; Sir Henry Colley was elevated to the Peerage as Lord Glaston by Henry VIII. He married the daughter of Thomas Cusack, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Catherine Wellesley Cusack (d.1598) whose grandmother was a Wellesley.

It was founded in Joure, Netherlands, by Egbert Douwes in 1753 as De Witte Os (\"The White Ox\"), a general grocery shop. The company later started dealing specifically in coffee, tea, and tobacco. By 1925, it had changed its name to Douwe Egberts (as in Douwe, the son of Egbert) and introduced its logo, a red seal with a \"D.E.\" initialism.\n\nIts former tobacco brand White Ox was named for the original De Witte Os grocery store in Joure; Douwe Egberts sold White Ox to Imperial Tobacco in 1998.\n\nIn May 2017, Douwe Egberts launched aluminium coffee capsules across supermarkets.\n\nAt the end of 2019, the company merged with Peet's Coffee and the two continue under the new name JDE Peet's. At the end of May 2020, this company was listed on the Euronext Amsterdam.

Douwe Egberts sold a number of coffee brands under self-developed ethical criteria and argued that the requirements were discriminatory.

The site of the park was first used for amusement rides in 1880, although the Dreamland name was not used until 1920 when the park's Grade II* listed Scenic Railway wooden rollercoaster was opened.\n\nThe number of amusements at the park increased during the 1960s and 1970s, and in 1981 the site was sold to the Dutch Bembom brothers, who renamed it \"Bembom Brothers White Knuckle Theme Park\". The name remained until it reverted to Dreamland in 1990.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the park began to enter into decline, and a number of rides were sold to other theme parks. The park's owner announced in 2003 that Dreamland would be closed and the site redeveloped, although the listing of the Scenic Railway meant it could not be moved. The site was sold to Margate Town Centre Regeneration Company in 2005, and this company proposed a residential redevelopment. A number of local residents then launched a campaign to restore and reopen Dreamland instead, although final closure was later in the same year. The site then fell into a state of disrepair as objections were raised to redevelopment plans, and was subject to a series of arson attacks including one which significantly damaged the Scenic Railway.\n\nThe public campaign to restore the park continued, and in September 2013, ownership passed to Thanet District Council after a compulsory purchase order was approved by a High Court judge. In 2014 it was confirmed that the park would be redeveloped. It re-opened in June 2015 as a \"Re-imagined Dreamland\". The operating company became insolvent in December 2015, but continued to operate under administration. A second refurbishment and relaunch took place in 2017, funded by the major creditor.\n\nHistory\n\nOrigins\n\nThe Dreamland site was a salt marsh known as the Mere that was inundated at high tide until 1809 when a causeway and seawall were built. In 1846 a railway terminus was built on the present Arlington site for the South Eastern Railway, followed in 1864 by a further terminus, for the rival London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LCDR) on the site of what is now Dreamland Cinema. The LCDR (under its subsidiary the Kent Coast Railway) completed this terminus in 1866, but no public service was ever offered. The junction faced Ramsgate, so a local Margate-Broadstairs-Ramsgate train service was envisaged.\n\nDreamland's remote origins as an entertainment venue date from the same year, when London restaurateurs Spiers and Pond opened a restaurant and dance hall in the unused railway terminus on the Mere causeway. Not being very successful, this 'Hall by the Sea' was bought by the Reeve family of Margate in 1870 for \u00a33,750, who also gradually acquired the low-lying land at the rear of the Hall.\n\nIn 1870, circus entrepreneur George Sanger went into partnership to run the 'Hall by the Sea' with Thomas Dalby Reeve, the then Mayor of Margate. After Reeve's death in 1875, Sanger became the sole proprietor of the Hall and the land behind it. This land behind the Hall, the former 'Mere', was turned into pleasure gardens with a mock ruined abbey, lake, statues and a menagerie \u2013 as well as sideshows and roundabouts. Animal cages and Gothic walls on the present Dreamland western and southern boundaries (now listed Grade II) date from this time. The main purpose of the menagerie was to act as a breeding and training centre for animals used in Sanger's travelling circus.\n\nThe first amusement rides were installed as early as 1880 when 'Sea on Land' machines were installed. Passengers sat in \u2018boats\u2019 that were made by a system of levers to pitch and roll as though at sea \u2013 a direct antecedent of the contemporary \u2018flight simulator\u2019 rides. In 1893 a large skating rink was built. Shortly after this, the park gained some notoriety as the venue for the murder of a sex-worker by the local circus strong man.\n\nSanger died in 1911 during a scuffle arising from the attempted murder of a friend (although Sanger himself may have been the intended target), and the park entered an uncertain period as part of the attraction was the charisma of the man himself. In the end, the site was purchased from his estate in 1919 for \u00a340,000 by John Henry Iles, who had already set up theme parks all over the world, including at Cairo, Berlin, Petrograd (now St Petersburg) and Pittsburgh.\n\nInspired by Coney Island, which he had visited in 1906, Iles renamed the site 'Dreamland' and initiated work on the construction of the Scenic Railway rollercoaster in 1919, having purchased the European rights to the Scenic Railway design from inventor and patent holder LaMarcus Adna Thompson. The ride opened to the public in 1920 with great success, carrying half a million passengers in its first year. Iles also brought to the park other rides common to the time including a smaller roller coaster, the Joy Wheel, Miniature Railway, The Whip, and the River Caves.\n\nExpansion\nA ballroom was constructed on the site of the skating rink in 1920, and in 1923 Iles built his variety cinema on the site. (In 1926, he was also responsible for the building of Margate's lido on the seafront.) Between 1920 and 1935 he invested over \u00a3500,000 in the site, constantly adding new rides and facilities and culminating in the construction of the Dreamland cinema complex in 1934. Iles ceased to be a director in 1938 and the business was taken over by his son Eric.\n\nMost of the Dreamland site was requisitioned by the Government during World War II, with the park reopening in June 1946. Eric Iles was manager. From 1947, it received investment from Butlins.\n\nThree generations of the Iles family \u2013 John Henry, Eric, and John \u2013 controlled Dreamland from 1919 until its sale in 1968. The new owners, Associated Leisure, introduced many innovations to Dreamland, including squash courts and, in an echo of the Sanger era, an ice rink and zoo. Much of the planting of the pleasure gardens dating from the 1870s survived until the 1970s when the gardens were removed and the rides expanded. 1976 saw the debut of a revolutionary new ride, the 'Orbiter', unveiled by travelling showman and Dreamland lessee Henry Smith, a ride which went on to become highly successful in other amusement parks and travelling fairs around the world. Smith, himself a descendant of George Sanger, also had a Skid, Waltzer, Speedway, Tip Top, and another Orbiter up until the park's change of ownership in 1981. 1980 saw the opening of a 240-seater 148\u00a0ft high Big wheel.\n\nDreamland was purchased by the Dutch Bembom Brothers in 1981. They owned several other amusement parks in continental Europe and renamed the site Bembom Brothers White Knuckle Theme Park, bringing in a new headline attraction in the form of the Anton Schwarzkopf-designed 'Looping Star' roller coaster. The name change lasted until 1990, when it reverted to Dreamland. Other changes they made included ceasing evening hours and charging for admission, rather than per ride. They also introduced many new \u2018high-tech\u2019 rides that updated the park and made it, by the late 1980s, one of the top ten most visited tourist attractions in the United Kingdom.\n\nDecline\nIn common with other traditional British seaside resorts, Margate's economic base depended on residential holidaymakers staying for several days, usually families holidaying for a week or more. This was supplemented by day-trippers on weekends and public holidays, when the resort could become very busy. With the rise of cheap package holidays abroad from the 1960s, however, the residential holiday trade progressively collapsed in the 1970s. This meant that footfall at entertainment venues in these resorts, such as Dreamland, declined sharply on summer weekdays while remaining relatively buoyant at weekends.\n\nDay-tripper trade at Margate remained substantial, but the loss of holiday revenue meant that the town began to struggle to maintain its infrastructure. This, in turn, started to affect its attractiveness as a day destination. However, the investment by Bembom Brothers indicates that this was not regarded as an appreciable threat to Dreamland at the beginning of the 1980s.\n\nMore immediately serious was the opening of much larger amusement parks closer to London, on expansive sites and with ample vehicle parking. Thorpe Park opened in 1979, and Chessington World of Adventures in 1987. At this time, the fastest train journey from London to Margate was just under two hours, and Dreamland has never had any public on-site parking.\n\nIn 1996 the Bembom family sold the site to local entrepreneur Jimmy Godden, who had previously operated the Rotunda Amusement Park at Folkestone and Ramsgate Pleasure Park at Ramsgate. At this time, most of the rides they owned were relocated. The 'Looping Star (Great America)' went to an amusement park in Budapest together with the looping boat ride The Mary Rose. The Looping Star's sister ride made a brief appearance for two seasons at Margate (previously at Camelot Theme park) before leaving again for its current home, Loudon Castle theme park, where it is called the Twist 'n' Shout.\n\nAfter his purchase of the park, Godden was able to secure European and regional grant aid to assist in an initial \u00a33m redevelopment. However, during Godden's tenure many of the rides were sold off, including the big wheel which had dominated the Margate skyline for two decades but was dismantled and sold to a park in Mexico.\n\nClosure\n\nIn 2003, Godden announced that Dreamland would close down and the land would be redeveloped. A vocal section of public opinion supported continued use of the Dreamland site as an amusement park, along with a government report in 2004.\n\nAfter the closure announcement, Dreamland was sold to Margate Town Centre Regeneration Company (MTCR) in 2005 for \u00a320m. A number of local residents then formed the 'Save Dreamland Campaign'. The campaign proposed to turn Dreamland into a heritage amusement park, consisting of a number of vintage rides and attractions from other British amusement parks. Some rides were obtained by Save Dreamland and placed in storage.\n\nAlthough it was initially announced that Dreamland would close in November 2003, it operated during 2004 and 2005. Definitive closure to the public was in 2005 and all of the rides apart from the Scenic Railway were then removed from the site. The Scenic Railway had been granted Grade-II listed status in 2002, and so could not be moved or dismantled.\n\nPart of the Scenic Railway was damaged by fire after an arson attack on 7 April 2008. About 25% of the structure, boarding station, storage sheds, and trains were destroyed and had to be removed as irreparable. The physical security of the site was upgraded, and the surviving structure surveyed. Some of the surviving machinery and chassis from the cars were salvaged and stored on site. Another suspected arson attack was carried out on the site on 28 May 2014, but this was confined to a disused building near the Scenic Railway.\n\nOn 25 April 2008 the Dreamland cinema's Listed building status increased from Grade II (buildings of special architectural or historic interest) to Grade II* (particularly significant buildings of more than local interest). The cinema, which featured a Compton theatre organ, was closed in 2007 following the opening of a new multiplex cinema at Westwood Cross. The buildings were placed under renovation and the Dreamland sign on the front tower has been refurbished with LED lighting and shines brightly at night.\n\nThe defunct cinema was sold by MTCR, by then renamed DreamlandLive Ltd. This was before the result of a court appeal by this company to stop Thanet District Council taking possession of the theme park under a compulsory purchase order, served in June 2011. The CPO was approved in August 2012.\n\nRe-opening project\nThe success of the Save Dreamland Campaign in attracting public awareness led to the establishment of the Dreamland Trust, a registered charity, in 2007 to co-ordinate a re-opening project.\n\nA total of \u00a318m in public funding was subsequently awarded to the project, to restore, preserve and maintain the listed structures, which included the Scenic Railway, menagerie cages and some of the internal building spaces. This money was also used to purchase five heritage rides.\n\nOn 16 November 2009, the Dreamland Trust was awarded a grant of \u00a33m by the Heritage Lottery Fund with further funding of \u00a33.7m and \u00a34m coming from the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Thanet District Council respectively, to restore the Scenic Railway and to develop the former Dreamland site as necessary for rejuvenation.\n\nThe Scenic Railway was regarded as being the focus of the rejuvenation of Dreamland as a heritage amusement park. Work began in September 2014, with a complete refurbishment of the track and new trains being built.\n\nSome historic rides from other parks were donated to the Dreamland Trust and put in storage for restoration at a later date. The majority of unique old rides at Pleasureland Southport were donated, which included the 1940s Caterpillar ride, King Solomon's Mines wooden roller-coaster (formerly of Frontierland, Morecambe and later moved to Pleasureland Southport), workings from the Ghost Train and River Caves, the Hall of Mirrors, Mistral, Haunted swing and the Skyride (Chairlift ride). The Junior Whip which stood at Blackpool Pleasure Beach was also donated.\n\nWayne Hemingway, his wife Gerardine, and the 'HemingwayDesign' team were appointed as designers of the envisaged new Dreamland in 2012.  This includes the creative vision for re-imagination and branding.\n\nAn additional \u00a310m in private funding was invested in the re-opening of Dreamland by the commercial operators chosen to run it, Sands Heritage Ltd. These funds were used to introduce a collection of 17 additional rides to create the amusement park, as well as a Roller Disco & Diner, Amusement Arcade, Vintage Pin Ball Arcade, Dreamland Emporium and The Octopus's Garden. The running agreement between Sands Heritage and Thanet District Council involved the former taking out a 99-year lease of the freehold property owned by the council as a result of the CPO, while the council remained responsible for certain aspects of repair and maintenance including as regards the Scenic Railway. Part of the capital raised by Sands Heritage was a \u00a3600 000 short-term secured loan from Arrowgrass Master Fund, an investment company based in the Cayman Islands. This company also held 31% of the share capital of Sands Heritage.\n\nOpening of Re-imagined Dreamland\n\nThe park re-opened on 19 June 2015, garnering much media coverage. BBC Radio Kent spent the opening day broadcasting live from Dreamland. Additional rides opened in July.\n\nThe entry fee to the park was \u00a314.95.\n\nThe park's centrepiece, the Scenic Railway, was still in the process of being rebuilt by Thanet District Council. It opened to the public only on 17 October 2015, owing to delays in rebuilding the train carriages. Member and press previews took place on 16 October 2015. Sands Heritage put in a claim for lost revenue as a result of the delay, which was settled in November with a compensation payment by TDC to Sands Heritage after the delay to opening the Scenic Railway forced the company into administration.\n\nAdministration\nOn 8 December 2015, Sands Heritage were forced to apply to the High Court for a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) in relation to a debt of \u00a32.9m owed to Arrowgrass. This amounted to the original \u00a3600 000 owed as a secured loan, plus unpaid compound interest and charges. At a meeting on 23 December 2015 the company's creditors agreed to accept the CVA, allowing the company more time to pay off its existing debts. Sands Heritage representatives at the meeting promised that the debt to Arrowgrass would be repaid over five years - as a secured debt, this took priority over other debts. The insolvency administrators appointed in the CVA were Duff & Phelps.\n\nThe financial failure was attributed primarily to the number of visitors in the summer season of 2015 being half of what was predicted for the capital structuring of the project. Media reports estimated the cash loss suffered by the company as being on the order of \u00a35\u00a0million. The major contributing factor for visitor shortfall was the delay of the Scenic Railway project and lack of communication from the management team of Thanet District Council to Sands Heritage, leading to a premature opening when preparatory works were incomplete. This led to an almost immediate closure of seventeen days to complete these, and the Scenic Railway was to take longer. Also, there were problems with running repairs to rides, leading to breakdowns. Despite popular belief, the admission price cited as discouraging visitors was not the reason for Sand Heritage's cash flow problems; however, the management team and the administrators, Duff & Phelps, abolished it to drive footfall when it became apparent the Scenic Railway would not work for a second summer season.\n\nIn August 2016, the CEO of Dreamland, Eddie Kemsley, resigned. A creditors' meeting held in August 2016 revealed that creditors were owed \u00a38.34m, with Sands Heritage having an overall balance sheet shortfall of \u00a314m (\u00a310m of which reflected the investment made by Sands Heritage themselves). An auditors' report to Thanet District Council in December that year revealed that several of these creditors were small local businesses with little hope of any repayment.\n\nThe administrators initially expressed their hope that Dreamland as a business could be sold as a going concern in March 2017, after the 2016 summer season. However, this was rendered improbable by their half-yearly report to creditors (December 2015 to June 2016) when they revealed that operating losses during the period were over \u00a31m or about \u00a341 000 per week. They warned that losses were continuing, factors cited being bad weather in early summer and the failure of the Scenic Railway in mid-June.\n\nThe Scenic Railway had been restored by Thanet District Council following the arson attack. Unfortunately the right knowledge and expertise had not been available when it was rebuilt, and so it failed a safety test in June 2017. The ride is powered by cable haulage, nowadays a rare form of traction worldwide, and the wrong sort of cables was specified. When TDC tried to rectify the matter after the failure, it found that the skills concerned were so specialist that they were rare worldwide and sourcing them was only successful after the summer season was over. The administrators indicated their intention to seek compensation for the failure.\n\nSecond relaunch\nArrowgrass covered the operating losses for the summer season of 2016 with a further loan of \u00a31m, secured on the premises of 49\u201351 Marine Terrace. This was a former pub owned freehold by Sands Leisure (not part of the TDC lease), which had been called the Cinque Ports Arms before the later 20th century. An extension of the administration period was sought, and granted.\n\nThen it was announced that the investment company had increased its lending to just under \u00a310m, to allow for a re-vamp of the business. In February 2017 it was reported that a \u00a325m private investment from Arrowgrass had been obtained.\n\nThe new loan was used to re-landscape the site and to add some new rides, with refurbishment of the Cinque Ports pub. The premises had been used as the ticket office for Dreamland and the administrative centre of Sands Leisure, but a bar was opened in it by the administrators in the 2016 season and it was due to be restored to a complete pub for the 2017 re-launch.\n\nThe improved park was announced as reopening on 28 April 2017; however this was later delayed to 26 May. The event attracted national media attention. The major new feature which was mentioned as adding to the viability of the business was a new music venue with a capacity of 15 000.\n\nPrivate investigation by a Thanet District councillor revealed that all the fixed assets of Sands Leisure had loans secured on them for repayment to Arrowgrass. These included the fairground rides owned by the company, as well as the 99-year lease from TDC and other properties owned freehold by the company. If the figure of indebtedness of \u00a325m quoted by the national media was correct, in May 2017 Arrowgrass had almost complete control of the value of the assets of Dreamland. According to the terms of the security given for the loans, if repayment conditions were breached then Arrowgrass could apply for Sands Leisure to be liquidated and could then claim the equity of the lease of the property in lieu.\n\nIn 2017, the park hosted 15,000 people at the Demon Dayz festival with Gorillaz. In October 2017 the park exited administration.\n\nIn 2019 the park reported experiencing its most successful year since reopening, with more than 700,000 visitors across the year, and announced a new programme of events for its 100th anniversary in 2020. In August 2019, the park unveiled a seven metre inflatable sculpture of Tina Turner's head, created by Cool Shit, in celebration of the 2019 Turner Prize exhibition being hosted in Margate.\n\nFestivals\nOn 6 March 2017 Gorillaz announced the Demon Dayz festival to be held at Dreamland on 10 June 2017. Tickets sold out in 32 minutes, at about 15,000 tickets in an hour.\n\nOn 14 September 2018 the National Citizen Service hosted their graduation ceremony at Dreamland, at which 700 Kent and Sussex teens graduated from the employability programme. Each received a signed certificate from the Prime Minister.\n\nIn popular culture\nDreamland was the subject of a 1953 documentary film, O Dreamland. It was also visited by characters in the 1989 Christmas special of the BBC Television sitcom Only Fools and Horses titled \"The Jolly Boys' Outing\". Some of the rides seen in the sitcom were renamed and repainted at Loudoun Castle Theme Park in Scotland (now closed). The Mary Rose was renamed the Black Pearl and is now at Lightwater Valley in North Yorkshire. In an episode of British sitcom One Foot in the Grave titled \"Dreamland\", during a conversation with Victor, Margaret recalls the couple visiting Margate and Dreamland on their third anniversary.\n\nThe park was also the filming location for the 2007 film Exodus and featured prominently in the 2000 film Last Resort, about a young Russian immigrant seeking asylum in England.\n\nDreamland is frequently alluded to in Graham Swift's 1996 novel Last Orders, as well as the 2001 film adaptation.\n\nThe Romford-based band Five Star shot the majority of the video for their 1984 single \"Crazy\" at Dreamland.\n\nOn 29 June 2015, the music video for the song 'Blue' by Marina and the Diamonds was shot at Dreamland.\n\nOn 26 September 2017, the Sky Mobile iPhone 8 commercial with actor Tom Hardy was shot at Dreamland.\n\nIn February 2022, the Dreamland Cinema signage was changed while the building was used as a set in Sam Mendes 1980s period film Empire of Light.\n\nIn June 2022, Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds performed at Dreamland.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n \n Campaign to save Dreamland\n\nAmusement parks in England\nTourist attractions in Kent\n1880 establishments in England\nMargate\n2003 disestablishments in England\nGrade II listed buildings in Kent\nGrade II* listed buildings in Kent\nAmusement parks opened in 1880\nAmusement parks closed in 2003", "This index is based on Macaulay\u2019s marginal notations, which are a running analysis of the contents of the Confessio Amantis, a 33,000-line Middle English poem by John Gower.

He was twice elected the twelfth Mayor of Washington D.C. During his lifetime he amassed an invaluable and vast collection of books, manuscripts, original maps and other archival material from statesmen, and American and British military officers of the American Revolution. Force's collection is considered to be among the most extensive. Force served in the Washington militia as a lieutenant during the War of 1812. Politically, he was a member of the Whig Party, and supporter of John Quincy Adams. He is mostly noted for editing and publishing a massive collection of historical documents, books and maps in several volumes involving the American colonies and the American Revolution which was ultimately purchased by the Library of Congress for a large sum. Force founded a political journal and other publications and was president of a premier national science society, and the Typographical Society which was largely charged with the task of communicating political affairs to the general public. Force served on the committee that approved the Geographical Department for the Library of Congress. During the international political unrest caused by the American Civil War, Force was sent to Europe by the Lincoln Administration to stabilize diplomatic relations with France and England.\n\nHistory\nPeter Force was born near the Passaic Falls in New Jersey, the son of William Force and Sarah Ferguson. William was a soldier in the Revolutionary War and a descendant of French Huguenots who arrived on America's shores in the 17th century. His father's participation in the war largely inspired Peter's interest in history. Force grew up in New Paltz, Ulster County, New York, and afterward moved to New York City, where he was schooled in the printing trade. Force married Hannah Evans; together they had ten children, including sons William Quereau Force (1820\u20131880), Charles Force (no DOB available) and Manning Force (1824\u20131899), who was a noted Major General from Ohio during the American Civil War. Force was not considered a jovial man, but rather quiet and reserved, yet had an amiable personality that attracted people to him.\n\nIn 1812 Force became a member of the New York Typographical Society, which was the city's printer trade union at the time. He was initiated at its general meeting on February 1, 1812. He was elected a director on December 5, 1812, and at age twenty-two was chosen president on July 3, 1813, with his re-election following in 1814 and 1815.\n\nDuring the War of 1812, Force served in the New York State Militia and rose to the rank of Sergeant and then to Lieutenant. \n\nForce began his varied career as a journeyman printer working for William A. Davis in New York City, and performed so well he was soon made the director of the office at age sixteen. In 1815, Force's employer secured a contract for the printing of Congress, and moved to Washington, D.C., and Peter Force, at age twenty-five, followed and also became a resident and a printer in that city. Soon he formed a partnership with Davis working as the foreman and public printer in the congressional printing plant, which at the time was quite small, having only four single-pull, wooden hand presses, which were sufficient to do all the work of the Government in 1816. In that same year he joined the Columbia Typographical Society and in 1826 became its first \"free member\". When Davis withdrew from the partnership Force formed other partnerships, of which he was the master mind.  \n\nEarly in his career in Washington Force attracted the attention of distinguished statesmen, and he was a leading character in the city throughout his life. Four years after arriving in Washington he founded and published an annual devoted to recording the facts of early American history, with its wide scope of official and statistical information. From 1820 to 1836, with a three-year interval involved in politics, he published the National Calendar, which later became the National Calendar and Annals of the United States. On November 7, 1836, the National Typographical Convention assembled in Washington, and appointed a committee of three \"to wait upon Mr. Force, Mayor of this city (a member of the Columbia Typographical Society), to tender to him the good wishes of the convention, and to invite him to honor it with his presence ...and welcomed in an ardent manner by an address from the president, and by congratulations of the members of the convention individually.\"\n\nDuring the 1820s, Force was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences and served as the president. In 1820 he began publishing the National Calendar, a statistical annual, which lasted 16 years, ending in 1836. From November 12, 1823, to February 2, 1830, Force published the National Journal, with moderate-conservative views about public concerns and issues, which became the official newspaper during the presidency of John Quincy Adams, and which also drew to its columns from some widely known contributors, including John Quincy Adams himself.  At the same time the journal tried to remain neutral in politics. The journal became a daily newspaper in 1824 and continued in this capacity until 1831. In 1830, however, Force gave up his position as the newspaper's editor.\n\nFrom 1820 until 1828 Force compiled, printed and published the Biennial Register, the official directory of the U.S. government. In 1827 Force was given the job of printing a 109-page supplement to the Catalogue of the Library of Congress at his printing shop in Washington on the corner of Eleventh Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. The supplement included an author index and titles contained in supplements of 1820 and 1825. \n\nDuring his lifetime he was also a member of the Smithsonian Institution and the United States Naval Observatory, and played a major role in organizing the American Historical Society, in Washington in 1836. On August 22, 1822, Force was granted US Patent 3573X for a method of color printing. He also founded, published, and wrote in the National Journal (1823\u20131830) and would later donate a stone to the Washington Monument. After vigorously supporting John Quincy Adams' election to the presidency in 1824, he served locally as councilman and alderman. During the seventh year of his residency in Washington he was elected to the City Council, then to the Board of Aldermen, and was chosen president by both bodies. He was elected mayor of Washington in 1836 and again 1838 without opposition, but when he ran again in 1848 he was defeated by a wide margin, all as a member of the Whig Party. Thereafter he became president of the National Institute for the Promotion of Science. Force was also elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1851.\n\nUp until the early 1850s, the Library of Congress lacked a geographical department and an adequate collection of maps for an institution of its size and station. Lieutenant Edward B. Hunt of the U.S. Army formulated a plan and proposed a resolution for such a department and appointed a committee to review the proposal. Force was on the committee that passed that resolution in 1856. The committee stated, \"There is not in the United States nor on this continent a single collection of geographical materials which is even tolerably complete.\" Many original and rare maps from the Force library were provided to this department.\n\nCivil War\nIn November 1861, Force was sent to Europe at the recommendation of influential friends in President Lincoln's administration in a diplomatic effort to appeal to the political circles in Paris and  London concerning their precarious relations with the Union and the Confederacy. Force was accompanied by Archbishop Hughes and Bishop McIlvaine with the hopes of inducing the respective governments to refrain from giving aid to the Confederacy. Force established healthy permanent relations with the various British and French statesmen.  Upon returning to America in early June 1862, he received from the Corporation of New York the honor of Freedom of the City. On June 9 of that year the Typographical Society expressed their gratitude for Force's safe arrival from a mission \"fraught with the safety, honor and welfare of our country,\" and invited him to visit its chambers so that his fellow-members could express their thanks and congratulations for his diplomatic efforts in convincing the governments and people of Europe of the Union Government's ability to defeat the Confederacy.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Peter's son, Manning Force rose through successive ranks to become a major-general in the Militia of the District of Columbia. He was present at the Battle of Vicksburg and served under William Tecumseh Sherman during Sherman's March to the Sea. During that war Peter and his son corresponded frequently.\n\nDuring the Northern Virginia campaign of 1862 General Robert E. Lee and his army were getting dangerously close to Washington D.C. Charles B. Norton, a Union colonel on the staff of General Fitz John Porter was, in civilian life, also an archivist and publisher, and offered to hide and store Force's large library of Americana over the concern of a possible Confederate attack on the capitol, but Force declined his offer.\n\nHistorian \u2013 Published works\n\nForce's methods as an archivist and publisher of source materials was different in various ways from that of some of his contemporaries like Jared Sparks. Unlike Sparks, Force rarely added editorial notes and was content to let the raw documents speak for themselves. Force methodologically followed his primary rule that no manuscript should be altered, which is what set him apart from some of the editors of his day. Nothing was to be added and nothing substituted. Conversely, when Sparks edited the Papers of George Washington, as an admirer of his hero, Sparks would often correct Washington's mistakes in grammar and would sometimes alter the meaning of a statement so as to make it conform to what he felt was in Washington's mind. This was a practice Force abhorred and would never tolerate.\n\nForce was the first historical scholar to discover that the so-called Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence of 1775 was not what it was claimed to be. Subsequently he published the declaration of independence, or Notes on Lord Mahon's History of the American Declaration of Independence.\n\nForce's greatest achievement came as a collector and editor of historical documents. He published Tracts and Other Papers, Relating Principally to the Origin, Settlement, and Progress of the Colonies in North America (4 vol Washington, 1836\u20131846), which comprised rare pamphlets. His nine volume American Archives, published at intervals from 1837 to 1853, was a collection of the most important documents of the American Revolution, 1774\u20131776.American Archives: Table of Contents, 2001, Northern Illinois University Library \n\nIn 1833 he was awarded a contract with the Federal Government for the preparation, printing  and publication of his massive compilation of archival material. It extended to nine volumes, which had been carefully arranged with great care and consummate skill, but after the delivery of the ninth volume the officials upon whom the law imposed the necessity of giving a viable review never managed to read the manuscripts, and the prospective publication of the work came to a standstill while Force was still eager to continue, and had many important documents and manuscripts yet to be printed. Futilely Force continued his efforts to prevail upon complacent and uninterested officers to reverse the action of their predecessors, and finally, and reluctantly, relinquished his cherished project, which he had earnestly pursued for more than 30 years.\n\nTwenty large folio volumes were planned but only the first 9 volumes were published between 1837 and 1853. Matthew St. Clair Clarke and Force were co-publishers of Force's American Archives. Force's lifelong desire to contribute to the Library of Congress finally came to fruition in 1867 when through an act of Congress it purchased his collection of original documents for $100,000, augmenting the expansion of the Library of Congress conducted by its librarian Ainsworth Rand Spofford, who directed the Library from 1865 to 1897.\n\nDuring his years of pursuing and buying archival material Force carried off prizes at auctions which the other competitors were not knowledgeable of. Force traveled about the eastern seaboard of the United States \"ransacking\" the book-shops and attending book auctions from Boston to Charleston in his tireless search for rare volumes. On one such occasion he was a bidder against the Library of Congress for a sizable and valuable library of bound pamphlets, the property of an early collector, who had consigned them to an auction house in Philadelphia. On another occasion while in Boston Force acquired from an antiquarian bookseller the only collection of Boston Revolutionary newspapers which were offered for sale in the last twenty-five years. He was soon reproached by some visitors from New England and admonished for depriving New England of its archival treasure. He rebuffed them replying, \"Why didn't you buy them yourselves, then?\" Force was relentless in his efforts to acquire complete and unbroken collections of all the Washington newspapers he could lay his hands on. After some thirty years he had amassed a collection which nearly filled the basement in his home. Into his elder years Force often visited the War Department, approaching various Army officers he knew in his quest for archival material. His collection of the printed \"Army orders\" from the War Department was considered \"a miracle of completeness\".\n\nIn 1867 the Library of Congress and a joint Committee of Congress was formed for the purpose of examining the extensive assortment of archival material in the Peter Force library. Because of its enormous size, totaling approximately 150,000 items, it was necessary for the committee to enter closely into details, and to devote much time and assiduous effort to the task of assessing Force's library. The committee spent at least two to three hours per day, for a two month period, in the examination of every document, manuscript, book, map, etc, that passed through their hands. To help simplify matters the contents of the Force library were categorized into seven basic classes. The committee found Force's archival collection to be encompassing in many respects: \"The plan of this work embraced nothing less than a complete publication of all the more important original State papers, letters, narratives, and other documents relating to the settlement and history of the United States, from the discovery of America. His library embraces an immense collection of the early American voyages, in Latin, French, Italian, Spanish, German, Dutch, and English, while in books and pamphlets relating to the politics and government of the American colonies, it stands unrivaled in this country.\"\n\nAmong the items in Force's collection, and considered the most valuable, are a series of original military maps and plans in manuscript, from the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. Claimed by some historians to be of exceeding interest, many of them are the actual work of officers in the American and British armies. The collection of some 300 hand-drawn maps covers the entire United States from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico. Among the manuscript items in Force's library are 48 folio volumes containing historical autographs of great rarity. In 1867 Ainsworth R. Spofford edited an eight-page report of the Committee's findings and assessments. In 1875, Peter Force's son, William Q. Force, donated various personal papers he had discovered to the Library of Congress. \n\nIt wasn't until the late twentieth century was the value of Force's collection of documents, manuscripts, books and other archival material finally recognized by much of the historical community. Force's vast collection of archives possessed the only surviving copies of many important documents of the colonial and revolutionary eras and proved to be a valuable scholarly resource. Many large research libraries in the United States and around the world hold Force's nine volume published works in their collections, however, it remains a relatively underused source of information. Scholars, historians, and students alike have found the massive work difficult to navigate using Force's complicated and varied index for the wide assortment of materials. In 2001 Northern Illinois University Libraries and Professor Allan Kulikoff from the University of Georgia received a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to fund the digitization of Force's American Archives'' and their presentation in a free-use World Wide Web site.\n\nFinal days\nForce maintained his ardent pursuit of collecting books, newspapers, manuscripts and other documents up until the week before he died, on January 23, 1868, at the age of 77. He is buried alongside his wife in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington D.C. Force's grave marker was designed by German sculptor Jacques Jouvenal. It is a marble obelisk that stands 16 feet high and rests on top of a square base. A relief is carved into the obelisk of a bookshelf filled with books. The District opened the Peter Force School in 1879 on the south side of Massachusetts Avenue between 17th and 18th Streets. It was razed in 1962.\n\nSelected works\n American archives: consisting of a collection of authentick records, state papers, debates, and letters, Vol.1\n\n American archives: consisting of a collection of authentick records, state papers, debates, and letters, Vol.2\n American archives: consisting of a collection of authentick records, state papers, debates, and letters, Vol.3\n American archives: consisting of a collection of authentick records, state papers, debates, and letters, Vol.4\n American archives: consisting of a collection of authentick records, state papers, debates, and letters, Vol.5\n  American archives: consisting of a collection of authentick records, state papers, debates, and letters, Vol.6\n\n Tracts and other papers relating principally to the origin, settlement, and progress of the colonies in North America : from the discovery of the country to the year 1776, Vol.1\n Tracts and other papers relating principally to the origin, settlement, and progress of the colonies in North America : from the discovery of the country to the year 1776, Vol.2\n\nSee also\n\n John Clement Fitzpatrick - historian and archivist of the Papers of George Washington\n Worthington C.

They are present in the membranes of organisms from the three domains of life: bacteria, archaea, and eukarya. They are the sensors for a number of systems including the senses of touch, hearing and balance, as well as participating in cardiovascular regulation and osmotic homeostasis (e.g. thirst). The channels vary in selectivity for the permeating ions from nonselective between anions and cations in bacteria, to cation selective allowing passage  Ca2+, K+ and Na+ in eukaryotes, and highly selective K+ channels in bacteria and eukaryotes.\n\nAll organisms, and apparently all cell types, sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. MSCs function as mechanotransducers capable of generating both electrical and ion flux signals as a response to external or internal stimuli. Under extreme turgor in bacteria, non selective MSCs such as MSCL and MSCS serve as safety valves to prevent lysis.  In specialized cells of the higher organisms, other types of MSCs are probably the basis of the senses of hearing and touch and sense the stress needed for muscular coordination. However, none of these channels have been cloned.  MSCs also allow plants to distinguish up from down by sensing the force of gravity.  MSCs are not pressure-sensitive, but sensitive to local stress, most likely tension in the surrounding lipid bilayer.\n\nHistory\n\nMechanosensitive channels were discovered in 1983 in the skeletal muscle of embryonic chicks by Falguni Guharay and Frederick Sachs. They were also observed (pub. 1986) in Xenopus oocytes, and frequently studied since that time. \nSince then, MS channels have been found in cells from bacteria to humans: they are now known to be present in all three domains of life (Archaea, Bacteria and Eukarya, incl. plants and fungi). In the decades since the discovery of MS, the understanding of their structure and function has increased greatly, and several have been cloned. Specifically, the cloned eukaryotic mechanosensitive channels include the K+ selective 2P domain channels and the recently cloned cation selective PIEZO family.\n\nClassification\n\nMS can be classified based on the type of ion to which they are permeable.\n\nCation Selective MSCs: As the name suggests, they exhibit a selective permeability for positive ions with the most selective channels being those for K+. The most common eukaryotic MSCs are cation selective passing Na+, K+ and Ca2+ but not Mg2+. They have a single channel conductance range (25-35 pS) and they are blocked by trivalent ion Gadolinium. The K+ selective MSCs such as TREK-1 are not blocked by Gd3+.\n\nAnion Channels: they exhibit a significant permeability for negative ions, and are not predominant as cation MS. They have a large conductance range (> 300pS).\n\nNon Selective ion channels: As the name indicates, they do not differentiate between positive and negative channels those are more common to Archaea and Bacteria, but rarely found in Eukarya.\n\nBroadly, most MS can be classified as lipid-gated channels\n\nFunctions\nFor a protein to be considered mechanosensitive, it must respond to a mechanical deformation of the membrane.  Mechanical deformations can include changes in the tension, thickness, or curvature of the membrane.  Mechanosensitive channels respond to membrane tension by altering their conformation between an open state and a closed state.  One type of mechanically sensitive ion channel activates specialized sensory cells, such as cochlear hair cells and some touch sensory neurons, in response to forces applied to proteins.\n\nStretch-activated ion channels are of use in the initial formation of an action potential from a mechanical stimulus, for example by the mechanoreceptors in an animal's vibrissae (whiskers).\n\nAfferent nerve fibers responsible for sensory stimulus detection and feedback are especially sensitive to stimulation. This results from the specialized mechanoreceptor cells that are superimposed upon the afferent nerve fibers. Stretch-activated ion channels are located on these mechanoreceptor cells and serve to lower the action potential threshold, thus making the afferent nerves more sensitive to stimulation. Afferent nerve endings without mechanoreceptor cells are called free nerve endings. They are less sensitive than the encapsulated afferent fibers and generally function in the perception of pain.\n\nStretch-activated ion channels are responsible for many bodily functions in mammals. In the skin they are responsible for sensing vibration, pressure sensation, stretch, touch, and light touch. They are expressed in sensory modalities including taste, hearing, smell, heat sensation, volume control, and vision. They can also regulate internal functions of our body including, but not limited to, osmotic pressure in cells, blood pressure in veins and arteries, micturition, and heart electrophysiology   and contractility. In addition to these functionalities, stretch-activated ion channels have also been found to be involved with balance and proprioceptive sensation.\n\nChannels that have traditionally been known as just \u201cvoltage-\u201c or \u201cligand-gated\u201d have also been found to be mechanically sensitive as well. Channels exhibit mechanical sensitivity as a general property. However, mechanical stress affects various types of channels in different ways. Voltage and ligand gated channels can be modified slightly by mechanical stimulation, which might change their responsiveness or permeability slightly, but they still respond primarily to voltage or ligands, respectively.\n\nExamples\nThe different families of stretch-activated ion channels are responsible for different functions around the body. The DEG/ENaC family consists of two subgroups: the ENaC subfamily regulates Na+ reabsorption in kidney and lung epithelia; the ASIC subfamily is involved in fear conditioning, memory formation, and pain sensation. The TRP superfamily of channels are found in sensory receptor cells that are involved in heat sensation, taste, smell, touch, and osmotic and volume regulation. MscM, MscS, and MscL channels (mechanosensitive channels of mini, small, and large conductance) regulate osmotic pressure in cells by releasing intracellular fluid when they become too stretched. In the body, a possible role in myoblast development has been described. Furthermore, mechanically gated ion channels are also found in the stereocilia of the inner ear.  Sound waves are able to bend the stereocilia and open up ion channels leading to the creation of nerve impulses. These channels also play a role in sensing vibration and pressure via activation of Pacinian corpuscles in the skin.\n\nTransduction mechanisms\nThere are two different types of stretch-activated channels between which it is important to distinguish: mechanically gated channels, which are directly influenced by mechanical deformations of the membrane, and mechanically sensitive channels, which are opened by second messengers released from the true mechanically gated channel.\n\nTwo different mechanisms have been found to open stretch-activated ion channels: Mechanical deformations in the cell membrane can increase the probability of the channels opening. Proteins of the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton are tethered to extra - and intra-cytoplasmic domains, respectively, of the stretch-activated ion channels. Tension on these mechanosensory proteins causes these proteins to act as a signaling intermediate, resulting in the opening of the ion channel. All known stretch-activated ion channels in prokaryotic cells have been found to be opened by direct deformation of the lipid bilayer membrane. Channels that have been shown to exclusively use this mechanism of gating are the TREK-1 and TRAAK channels. In studies using mammalian hair cells, the mechanism that pulls on proteins tethered from the intra- and extra-cytoplasmic domain of the channel to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, respectively, is the most likely model for ion channel opening.\n\nMechanical deformation of the cell membrane can be achieved by a number of experimental interventions, including magnetic actuation of nanoparticles. An example of this is the control of calcium influx of axons and boutons within neural networks. Note that this is not an indication of 'magnetic stimulation' of mechanosensitive channels.\n\nGating mechanism\n\nAlthough MS vary in many aspects, structures and functions, all the MS studied to date share an important feature: in a process called gating, they all open in a pore-like manner when protein channels are activated by a mechanical stimulus. There are currently two models of the gating process that explain how membrane-activated ion channels open.\n\nLipid bilayer Tension or stretch model: In this model tension in the lipid bilayer triggers conformational changes, thus leading to the opening of the channels. The tension perceived by the protein comes from the lipids. It has been demonstrated that the tension/stretch profile in the lipid bilayer is originated by membrane curvature and bilayer-protein hydrophobic mismatch.\n\nSpring-like Tether model: In this model a spring-like tether is attached directly to the MS channel and can be present in either the cytoskeleton or the extracellular matrix linking these elements together. When external stimuli deflect the tether the displacement opens the channel. This particular mechanism has been demonstrated to be the responsible for gating hair cells which are responsible for hearing in vertebrates.\n\nBacterial MS\n\nBacterial MS channels were first discovered by patch-clamp experiments in E. coli. They have been classified based on their conductance as mini (MscM), small (MscS) and large (MscL). These channels function in tandem-mode and are responsible of turgor regulation in bacteria; when activated by changes in the osmotic pressure. MscM is activated first at really low pressures followed by MscS, and finally MscL being the last chance of survival during osmotic shock. Their task was demonstrated when bacteria missing both MscS and MscL was lysed after exposure to osmotic downshocks.\n\nMscS: Small conductance mechanosensitive channel.\n\nThe main conductance is 1nS in buffer solution. Channel-proteins have been found in gram positive and gram negative bacteria, archaea and plants. MscS channel was found after  studies in E. coli spheroplasts. The identification of the gene family necessitated for MS of small conductance was as two different channels. YggB encoding MscS and KefA encoding MscK in E. coli further confirm its role osmotic regulation. Mutagenesis studies showed that when both genes YggB and KefA were deleted MscS lost its function, but maintain MscL and MscM, but mutants deficient of YggB and MscL showed that the function of those channel is to open in respond to pressure range right before cell rupture.\n\nThe 3D structure of this channel at closed state was elucidated after the crystallography study by Bass et al. which showed that at resolution of 3.9 \u00c5 this 31kDa protein is an homoheptamer forming a channel with 80 \u00c5 of diameter and 120 \u00c5 in length, each subunit contains three transmembrane domains (TM1, TM2, and TM3) with the N-terminal facing the periplasm and the C-terminal embedded in the cytoplasm. The TM3 is highly conserved in MscS family and it is thought to play an important role in MS prokaryotic gating.  MscS is a small protein composed of 286 amino acid residues activated by both tension in the lipid bilayer and voltage; in 2002 Vasquez et al. detailed this process and showed that during the change from closed state to open state the TM1 tilt and rotate making TM2 being exposed to the membrane and the TM3 helices expand, tilt, and rotate. During the rearrangement the confined part of the pore was measured as 11 \u00c5, and water molecules were more accessible to the TM3. The two transmembrane domains are in continuous contact with the lipid bilayer and are thought to be the sensor for the tension in the lipid bilayer as well as sensor for voltage because of the three arginine residues present in those domains.\n\nAlthough MscS is activated by voltage it has been demonstrated that, voltage itself is insufficient to open the channel, thus functioning in a cooperative manner with the channel. The more positive voltage, the higher the probabilities of opening the channel as long as pressure over the threshold is still applied in the system; the performance of this channel at higher voltage has not been completely understood. MscS has a small affinity for negative ions including Cl-, and glutamate.\n\nMscL: Large conductance mechanosensitive channel.\n\nIn bacteria MscL was the first MS channels cloned and sequenced, and is by far one of the most studied channels.  The gene encoding MscL protein is trkA and it is located in the inner membrane of the E. coli. The protein is 17 KDa, and consists of 136 amino acids; mostly hydrophobic residues resulting in two hydrophobic segments, however molecular weight of the functional channel is presumed to be 60-70 KDa from gel filtration experiments, suggesting oligomerization. As a common feature no cysteines residues are present in this channel.\n\nIn 1998 the homolog MscL from mycobacterium tuberculosis Tb-MscL was elucidated at closed state by X ray crystallography at 3.5 \u00c5 resolution. The protein is a homopentamer composed mostly of helical regions trans orientation of the helices with respect to the bilayer, with two domains: the cytoplasmic and the transmembrane. The channel is 85 \u00c5 in length, 35 \u00c5 and 50 \u00c5 for the cytoplasmic transmembrane domain respectively and 50 \u00c5 in diameter. The helices cross the membrane twice with both the C-terminal and the N-terminal, thus having two transmembrane domains TM1 and TM2 being TM1 the most conserved region among MscL proteins especially at the N-terminal region. It is located in the cytoplasm and forms a \u03b1-hydrophobic helix called S1; the region between the transmembrane domains form a loop that is divided into two regions: S2 a glycine-proline rich region and S3 a short helical section. The secondary structure of the protein is resistant to thermal denaturation still in the presence of SDS.\n\nDuring the activation of the prokaryotic MscL by tension in the lipid bilayer an intermediate state was determined. The S1 segments form a bundle when the structure is in the closed state, and the crosslinking of S1 segments prevents the opening of the channel.  When tension is applied to the membrane the transmembrane barrel-like structure expand and stretch apart the region S1-TM1 allowing the channel to open. The size of the pore at open state is approximately 25\u00c5. The transition from closed to intermediate state is accompanied by small movements of the TM1; further transitions to the open stated are characterized by big rearrangements in both the TM1 and TM2.\n\nRole of lipid bilayer in MS\n\nThe lipid bilayer is an important structure in all living cells; it has many functions such as separation of compartments, and signaling among others. In the case of the prokaryotic protein channels MscS and MscL both are gated by tension in the lipid bilayer, thus suggesting an important role in such a complex structures.\n\nThe tension in the membrane bilayer has been extensively studied, simple intrinsic properties of the lipids can account for the contributions in the free energy of the open, intermediate, and close state of the MS channels.  The bilayer possess different features that allows it to transduce tension and to prevent exhaustive deformations, the first one is \u201cin plane fluidity of the lipid bilayer\u201d meaning that any in plane tension in the lipid bilayer is felt homogenously in the absence of cytoskeleton interactions. The lipid molecules have specific spaces, preventing the bilayer from changing.\n\nThe contribution of membrane deformation in the gating of MS channels can be divided in two types: the deformation of the plane of the bilayer, and the deformation of the thickness of the bilayer. Also during any process involving changes in the structure, the free energy of the process itself is also an important factor. During gating the major processes that account for this event are: hydrophobic mismatch, and membrane curvature. It has been calculated that the free energy of the tension in the lipid bilayer is similar to the energy needed for gating the channels.\n\nA different study showed that the length of the hydrophobic tail affects its functioning as well as supporting the different states, Phosphatidylcholine (PC) 18 stabilizes better the open state of the MscL channel, PC 14 stabilizes the intermediate state, and a mixture of PC 18 and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) stabilizes the closed state, suggesting that the bilayer thickness (for carbon tail lengths of 16, 18 and 20) affects channel function. In conclusion the energy from the environment of the membrane plays an important role in the total energy of channel gating.\n\nEukaryotes \nIn eukaryotes, two of the best known mechanosensitive ion channels are the potassium channels TREK-1 and TRAAK, both of which are found in mammalian neurons.\n\nRecently, a new mechanosensitive ion channel family was cloned, with two mammalian members, PIEZO1 and PIEZO2. Both these channels are expressed in the lungs and bladder, organs with important mechanosensory functions. Piezo1 is also expressed in the skin, and in red blood cells, and its gain of function mutations cause hereditary xerocytosis. Piezo2 is expressed in sensory neurons of the dorsal root and trigeminal ganglia indicating that it may play a role in touch sensation. Mutations in piezo2 are associated with a human disease named Distal Arthrogryposis.\n\nPhysiological role of MS\n\nMS channels are ubiquitously expressed in the membrane of prokaryotes suggesting their significance.  In Bacteria and Archaea the function of these channels is conserved and it has been demonstrated that they play a role in turgor regulation. In Eukarya MS channels are involved in all five senses. The main family is TRP, and one good example is hair cells involved in the hearing process. When a wave of sound deflects the stereocilia, the channel opens. This is an instance of the Spring-like Tether gating mechanism. Recent studies have revealed a new role of mechanosensitive pathways in which naive mesenchymal stem cells are committed to a particular lineage based on the elasticity of its surrounding matrix.\n\nMS have also been suggested as a potential target for antibiotics, the reasoning behind this idea is that both McsS and MscL are highly conserved among prokaryotes, but their homologs have not been found in animals making them an exceptional potential for further studies.\n\nIn mammalian neurons, opening of the ion channels depolarizes the afferent neuron producing an action potential with sufficient depolarization. Channels open in response to two different mechanisms: the prokaryotic model and the mammalian hair cell model. Stretch-activated ion channels have been shown to detect vibration, pressure, stretch, touch, sounds, tastes, smell, heat, volume, and vision. Stretch-activated ion channels have been categorized into three distinct \"superfamilies\": the ENaC/DEG family, the TRP family, and the K1 selective family. These channels are involved with bodily functions such as blood pressure regulation. They are shown to be associated with many cardiovascular diseases. Stretch-activated channels were first observed in chick skeletal muscles by Falguni Guharay and Frederick Sachs in 1983 and the results were published in 1984. Since then stretch-activated channels have been found in cells from bacteria to humans as well as plants.\n\nThe opening of these channels is central to a neuron's response to pressure, often osmotic pressure and blood pressure, to regulate ionic flow in internal environments.\n\nTechniques used to study MS\n\nThis is a short list of the most frequently techniques used to study the properties, function, mechanism and other features of these channels:\nPatch-clamp: Single cell recording.\nEPR\nMolecular dynamics simulation: determination of the atomic fluctuation of the system.\nAtomic force Microscopy: mechanical forces of the membrane.\nMicropipette Aspiration:  Pressure to cells.\n3D simulations\n\nMutagenesis\n\nThrough experiments performed on the cytoskeleton and extra-cytoplasmic matrix of stretch-activated ion channels, these structures have been shown to play significant roles in mechanotransduction. In one such experiment on adult heart cells, whole cell recordings were taken on cells being squeezed with two pipettes at 1\u00a0Hz/1\u00a0um. This squeezing produced no current until five minutes in when a large depolarization was observed. Hereafter, the cell became extremely responsive to every compression and gradually decreased sensitivity over the next few minutes. Researchers hypothesized that, initially, the cytoskeleton was buffering the mechanical deformation of the squeezing from the channel. The depolarization at five minutes was the cytoskeleton snapping which subsequently caused the channel to sense the mechanical deformations and thereby respond to the stimuli. Researchers believe that over the few minutes where the channel repaired itself the cytoskeleton must be repairing itself and newly adapting to the squeezing stimuli.\n\nStructure\n\nENaC/DEG superfamily\n\nASIC\nThere are six known ASIC subunits, ASIC1a, ASIC1b, ASIC2a, ASIC2b, ASIC3, and ASIC4, which have two transmembrane domains, extracellular and intracellular loops, and C and N termini. These ASIC subunits likely form tetramers with varying kinetics, pH sensitivity, tissue distribution, and pharmacological properties.\n\nTRP superfamily\nThere are seven subfamilies within the TRP superfamily: TRPC (canonical), TRPV (vanilloid), TRPM (melastatin), TRPP (polycystin), TRPML (mucolipin), TRPA (ankyrin), and TRPN (NOMPC-like). TRP proteins typically consist of six transmembrane domains, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6, with a pore between S5 and S6. These contain intracellular N and C termini, which form tetramers and vary in length and domain. Within the channel there are ankyrins, which are structural proteins that mediate protein-protein interactions, and are thought to contribute to the tether model of stretch-activated channel opening. NOMPC, identified in D. melanogaster mechanotransduction and a member of the TRPN subfamily, contains a relatively high number of ankyrins.\n\nK1-selective superfamily\nK2P channels consist of six subfamilies and contain four transmembrane domains, which form two pores each between domains 1\u20132 and 3\u20134. K2P channels also contain a short N terminal domain and a C terminal which varies in length. There is also a large extracellular linker region between domain 1 and the first pore formed between domains 1\u20132.\n\nExamples\nTRP channels are typically non-selective, although a few are selective for calcium or hydrated magnesium ions, and are composed of integral membrane proteins. Although many TRP channels are activated by voltage change, ligand binding, or temperature change, some TRP channels have been hypothesized to be involved in mechanotransduction. Some examples are TRPV4, which mediates mechanical load in a variety of tissues, including the liver, heart, lung, trachea, testis, spleen, salivary glands, cochlea, and vascular endothelial cells, as well as TRPC1 and TRPC6, which are involved in muscle mechanosensation. TRPC1 is expressed in the myocytes of the heart, arteries, and skeletal muscle. TRPC1 is widely considered to be a non-selective \u201cstore-operated ion channel\u201d (SOC) involved in the calcium influx following calcium depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. TRPC6 is a calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel expressed in the cardiovascular system. TRPC6 is potentially a sensor of mechanically and osmotically induced membrane stretch, and is possibly directly gated by membrane tension. Other examples include TREK-1 and TRAAK which are found in mammalian neurons and are classified as potassium channels in the tandem pore domain class and \"MID-1\" (also known as \"MCLC\" or CLCC1.)\n\nThe six K2P channel subfamilies are regulated by various physical, cellular, and pharmacological stimulants, including membrane stretch, heat, pH change, calcium flux, and protein kinases.\n\nClinical relevance\nStretch-activated ion channels perform important functions in many different areas of our body. Pressure-dependent myogenic constriction resistance arteries require these channels for regulation in the smooth muscle of the arteries. They have been found to be used for volume sensing in animals and blood pressure regulation. Bacteria have been shown to relieve hydrostatic pressure through MscL and MscS channels.\n\nPathologies associated with stretch-activated ion channels\nStretch-activated ion channels have been correlated with major pathologies. Some of these pathologies include cardiac arrhythmia (such as atrial fibrillation), cardiac hypertrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and other cardiovascular diseases.\n\nBlocking stretch-activated ion channels\nGadolinium (Gd3+) and other lanthanides have been shown to block stretch-activated ion channel function. The peptide toxin isolated from the Chilean rose tarantula (Grammostola rosea, synonym G. spatulata), mechanotoxin 4 (GsMTx4) has been shown to inhibit these channels from the extracellular side, but it does not inhibit all stretch-activated ion channels and particularly has no effect on 2p channels.\n\nList of diseases associated with mechanosensitive channels\nPolycystic kidney disease.\nAtrial fibrillation\n\nAbnormalities in the function of MS channels can cause:\nNeuronal disease\nMuscular degeneration.\nCardiac  arrhythmias\nHypertension.\n\nSee also\nMechanosensation\nLarge-conductance mechanosensitive channel\nSmall-conductance mechanosensitive channel\nVoltage-gated ion channels\nLigand-gated ion channels\nLipid-gated ion channels\nThe grate NYU websites\n\nReferences\n\nThe following is not referenced in the article, and/or is in conflict with Engler, A. et al., 2006:\n\n \n\nMembrane biology\nTransmembrane proteins\nIon channels", "Constantinos Stathelakos (, Konstandinos Stathelakos; born 30 December 1987) is a Cypriot track and field athlete who competes in the hammer throw.

It was inaugurated on 1 August 1946 by Jiwaji Rao Scindia. The college building was inaugurated by Deputy Prime Minister of India Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on 5 December 1948. It has 200 undergraduate seats for MBBS course, 68 seats for post graduation courses and 36 seats for diploma courses.\n\nBackground\nIn 1942 Dr Sanjay Raikwar from Chhatarpur, a physician in Gwalior, was the Medical Superintendent of the JA Hospital. He was also the personal physician of Rajmata Gajar Raja Scindhia. After the death of Rajmata Scindhia (12 January 1943), her son Maharaja Jiwaji Rao Scindhia, who inherited a large sum of money, created a trust called \"Gajar Raja Memorial Trust\" with Sardar Phalke, DK Jhadav and Dr. B. Sahai as its members. Dr. Sahai who once dreamt of establishing a teaching center in Gwalior saw the possibility of his dream being fulfilled and proposed a medical institute.  A proposal for the same was made and approved after lot of difficulties and financial sanction was given in the budget for 1945-46. A total sum of Rs. 20 Lacs was sanctioned on the occasion of the birth of Madhav Rao Scindhia in 1945.\n\nOn 21 November 1945 Viceroy of India Lord Wavell on his visit to Gwalior laid the foundation stone of the college as the 17th medical college of India. A building of the Gwalior Medical Association, near JA Hospital, was used as lecture hall and accommodation was built on either side of it for anatomy and physiology departments. A space for 35 students for dissection hall and physiology laboratory was planned as a temporary measure, and a swimming pool and sports ground were provided.\n\nThe college administration approached Agra University for affiliation, which was granted. 36 students were admitted as the first batch, and a hostel at Bhausahib Shinde's Kothi was made with eight students occupying it.\n\nInauguration\nThe college was inaugurated by Maharaja Jiwaji Rao Scindia, the ruler of Gwalior state. The college was recognized by the Medical Council of India in 1946. Postgraduate training started in 1951.\n\nThe Neurosurgery wing was given to the college by Padma Shri Award-winner RS Dharkar, who started the first Neurosurgery Hospital of Central India and trained many neurosurgeons.\n\nThe Department of Medicine was first one to introduce telemedicine in Madhya Pradesh along with a complete ambulance fitted with monitor linked to ICU in the JA Hospital.\n\nThe medical college was given autonomous status, governed by a board of members, at the end of 1997.

It saw active service during the First World War in the Middle Eastin the Senussi Campaign and the Sinai and Palestine Campaignfrom 1915 to 1918.  A second line battery, 2/1st Nottinghamshire RHA, served in the Mesopotamian Campaign in 1917 and 1918 as a Field Artillery battery.  Post-war, it was reconstituted as a Royal Field Artillery battery.\n\nHistory\n\nFormation\nThe Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry.  On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades.  Each yeomanry brigade included a horse artillery battery and an ammunition column.\n\nOn 18 March 1908, the Nottinghamshire Royal Horse Artillery (Territorial Force) was proposed as a new unit and it was recognized by the Army Council on 31 July 1908 (and the ammunition column on the same date). The unit consisted of\nBattery HQ at Nottingham\nNottinghamshire Battery at Nottingham\nNottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade Ammunition Column also at Nottingham \nThe unit was equipped with four Ehrhardt 15-pounder guns and allocated as artillery support to the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade.  The battery was raised and trained by Major Joe Laycock.\n\nFirst World War\n\nIn accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service.  Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units.  2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course.\n\n1/1st Nottinghamshire\nThe 1st Line battery was embodied with the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade on 4 August 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War.  Initially, the brigade concentrated in Berkshire and on 5 August 1914 was assigned to the 1st Mounted Division.  A decision was made to form a new mounted division from the mounted brigades in and around the Churn area of Berkshire.  On 2 September 1914, 2nd Mounted Division, with Headquarters at Goring, came into being and the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade was transferred to the new division.  I Brigade and II Brigade, RHA (T.F.) were formed for the division and the battery was assigned to II Brigade, RHA at Churn, along with Berkshire RHA and A Battery and B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company.\n\nIn November 1914, the division moved to Norfolk on coastal defence duties.  Artillery headquarters was established at Cromer, before joining the divisional headquarters at Hanworth in December, and Nottinghamshire RHA was at Letheringsett (Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade was at Holt).\n\nOverseas service\nIn March 1915, the 2nd Mounted Division was put on warning for overseas service.  In early April, the division starting leaving Avonmouth and the last elements landed at Alexandria before the end of the month.  By the middle of May, the horse artillery batteries were near Isma\u00eflia on Suez Canal Defences.\n\nThe 2nd Mounted Division was dismounted in August 1915 and served at Gallipoli.  The artillery batteries and ammunition columns (along with the signal troops, mobile veterinary sections, Mounted Brigade Transport and Supply Columns and two of the Field Ambulances) were left behind in Egypt.  The division returned from Gallipoli in December 1915 and was reformed and remounted.\n\nThe battery never rejoined the division; on 28 November 1915 the battery departed Ismailia for the Western Desert and joined the Western Frontier Force on formation at Mersa Matruh. It served throughout the Senussi Campaign, taking part in the Affairs at Wadi Senab (1113 December 1915), Wadi Majid (25 December), and Halazin (23 January 1916), and in the action at Agagiya (26 February) which effectively ended the campaign.\n\nImperial Mounted Division\nThe Imperial Mounted Division was formed in Egypt in January 1917 with four cavalry brigades: the Australian 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Mounted Brigades.  The Nottinghamshire Battery was one of four that formed the XIX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.) to support the division.  In practice, the battery was attached to 3rd Light Horse Brigade.\n\nThe battery served with the Imperial Mounted Division in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign as part of the Desert Column.  With the division, it took part in the advance across the Sinai.  The battery was re-equipped with four 18 pounders in time for the First Battle of Gaza (2627 March 1917).  It also took part in the Second Battle of Gaza (1719 April 1917).\n\nAustralian Mounted Division\n\nIn June 1917, the Desert Column was reorganised from two mounted divisions of four brigades each (ANZAC and Imperial Mounted Divisions) to three mounted divisions of three brigades each (ANZAC, AustralianImperial Mounted Division renamedand the new Yeomanry Mounted Division).  6th Mounted Brigade, along with Berkshire RHA, joined the Yeomanry Mounted Division and on 20 June 1917 the Imperial Mounted Division was redesignated as Australian Mounted Division as the majority of its troops were now Australian.  On 12 August 1917, the Desert Column disappeared and the Desert Mounted Corps was formed.\n\nThe battery served with the Australian Mounted Division for much of the remainder of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign.  As part of the Desert Mounted Corps, the division took part in the Third Battle of Gaza (by now the battery was re-equipped with four 13 pounders), in particular the Capture of Beersheba (31 October) and the Battle of Mughar Ridge (13 and 14 November), and the defence of Jerusalem against the Turkish counter-attacks (27 November3 December).\n\nStill part of the Desert Mounted Corps, the division took part in the Second Trans-Jordan Raid (30 April4 May 1918).  XIX Brigade, RHA supported the 4th Light Horse Brigade in the advance on the Jisr ed Damiye\u2013Es Salt track on 30 April.  The next day, a strong Turkish force attacked from the direction of Jisr ed Damiye and soon the artillery was in danger.  B Battery, HAC was in the rear and managed to get away with all but one of their guns (stuck in a wadi) but the Nottinghamshire RHA and A Battery, HAC were less fortunate.  Machine gun fire cut down the horse teams before the guns could be gotten away.  XIX Brigade lost 9 guns in total, the only guns to be lost in action in the entire campaign.\n\n5th Cavalry Division\nThe battery was attached to the 5th Cavalry Division in September and October 1918 to support the division in the Final Offensive including the Battle of Megiddo (1925 September), the Capture of Damascus (1 October), and the Occupation of Aleppo (26 October).\n\n2/1st Nottinghamshire\n\nNottinghamshire RHA formed a 2nd line in 1914, initially designated as the Nottinghamshire (Reserve) Battery RHA and later given a fractional designation as 2/1st Nottinghamshire Battery, RHA.\n\nBy February 1915, the battery joined the 2nd Line 2/1st Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade, duplicate of the 1st Line Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Mounted Brigade.  On 6 March 1915, the 2/2nd Mounted Division was formed as a duplicate of the 2nd Mounted Division which had been warned for overseas service.  The brigade joined the division on East Coast Defences in March 1915 and concentrated at Narborough with the battery at Scarning and Wendling.\n\nThe batteries of the division were quite unready for war.  Three had no horses, the fourth had just 23; three batteries had over 200 men on average, but the other just 91; one battery had no ammunition and another reported that its 15-pounders were \"practically useless\".\n\nThe battery remained with the division when it was redesignated as 3rd Mounted Division in March 1916 and as 1st Mounted Division in July 1916.  In September 1916, the battery was attached to the 8th Cyclist Brigade in 2nd Cyclist Division (former 4th Mounted Division) until the division was broken up on 16 November 1916.\n\nThe battery was posted overseas in June 1917, arriving at Basra on 13 August when it joined CCXV Brigade, RFA (T.F.) and was numbered as 812th Battery, RFA (T.F.).  At this point it was armed with six 18 pounders.  CCXV Brigade was serving with 3rd (Lahore) Division but was transferred to 15th Indian Division on 4 October.  The battery remained with the 15th Indian Division, participating in the Mesopotamian campaign, for the remainder of the war.  It took part in the Occupation of H\u012bt (9 March 1918) and the action of Khan Baghdadi (2627 March).  After the end of the war, the division was run down as units were posted away or repatriated, being disbanded in March 1919.\n\nThe 15th Indian Division was formally disbanded in March 1919, and there is no further mention of the 2/1st Nottinghamshire RHA in the official histories. Most British troops attached to Indian Army divisions in Mesopotamia found themselves in India when their divisions were disbanded/repatriated, as there was a shortage of shipping to get the men home to Britain. In April 1919 the Third Anglo-Afghan War broke out, and British troops were inducted into various units to serve. At least one soldier of the 2/1st Notts is known to have fought in this war with another battery.\n\nPost war\nThe Nottinghamshire RHA was not reconstituted until 7 February 1920 when it formed a battery (later numbered 240th) in 1st North Midland Brigade, RFA (later 60th (North Midland) Field Regiment, RA) and ceased to be a Royal Horse Artillery battery. The Leicestershire RHA also joined the brigade as 240th Battery. In 1938 these two batteries were detached from 60th (NM) Field Regiment (as it had become) to form a separate 115th (North Midland) Field Regiment, RA, which saw service in the Battle of France and Burma Campaign in World War II. In 1950 it was amalgamated into 350 (South Notts Hussars Yeomanry) Heavy Regiment, RA.\n\nSee also\n\n List of Territorial Force horse artillery batteries 1908\n The England test cricketer Harry Elliott, who had worked for Major Laycock before the war, served with the battery.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n \n \n \n \n \n \n Norman E.H.

The term revenge tragedy was first introduced in 1900 by A. H. Thorndike to label a class of plays written in the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras (circa 1580s to 1620s).\n\nOrigins\n\nMost scholars argue that the revenge tragedies of William Shakespeare and his contemporaries stemmed from Roman tragedy, in particular, Seneca's Thyestes. Seneca's tragedies followed three main themes: the inconsistency of fortune (Troades), stories of crime and the evils of murder (Thyestes), and plays in which poverty, chastity and simplicity are celebrated (Hippolytus).\n\nIn Thyestes, Seneca portrayed the evil repercussions of murder. In order to exact revenge on his brother Thyestes for adultery with his wife, Atreus lures him to Argos under the pretext of a shared rule, but instead tricks him into eating the cooked flesh of his own children. Seneca's criminals (in this case Thyestes) are always deserving of their punishment unless they repent, since he believed the will to do evil is entirely in the hands of the individual, who must therefore be appropriately punished. This ethical logic becomes complicated, however, since the revenging murder is also a crime, transforming the revenger into a criminal, and thus prompting retribution on behalf of the punished.\n\nConventions of revenge plays\n\nThe ghost of the murdered victim urges revenge (Hamlet, Spanish Tragedy),\nMetatheatricality\nMadness \nMurder\nCannibalism\n\nHistory/Development\n\nThe revenge tragedy was established on the Elizabethan stage with Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy in 1587. In this play, Hieronimo's discovery of his son Horatio's dead body leads him into a brief fit of madness, after which he discovers the identity of his son's murderers and plans his revenge through a play-within-a-play. It is during this play that he enacts his revenge, after which he kills himself. With Hieronimo's quest for justice in the face of a seemingly powerless state, Spanish Tragedy introduced the thematic issues of retributive justice that would be explored as the genre gained popularity and developed on the Elizabethan and Jacobean stage. The distinction and cultural contention between public and private revenge has been considered by some to be the defining theme of not only early modern revenge tragedy but all early modern tragedy. The tension between public and private revenge, then, has also led to disputes between whether the protagonists enacting private revenge are heroes or villains: is Hieronimo, a character who seeks private revenge to gain retribution for the private murder of his son, a villain or a hero?\n\nBelieved to have been staged shortly afterwards, Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus is another early piece of the genre in which the dangerous cycle of revenge through private justice is brought to the fore and the typical features of the genre can be found. In this play, Titus' murder of Tamora's eldest son in a ritual of war leads to the rape and mutilation of his daughter Lavinia. As his revenge, Titus murders Tamora's remaining sons, bakes them into pie, and serves them to her at a feast.\n\nOne of the great contentions of the revenge tragedy is the issue of private revenge vs. divine revenge or public (i.e. state sanctioned) revenge. In his essay, \"Of Revenge,\" Francis Bacon writes: \"the first wrong, it doth but offend the law; but the revenge of that wrong, putteth the Law out of Office. Certainly, in taking revenge, a man is but even with his Enemy. But in passing it over, he is Superior: For it is a princes part to Pardon.\"\n\nAs the genre gained popularity, playwrights explored the issue of private vs. public or state justice through the introduction of a variety of revenge characters. In Antonio's Revenge, John Marston creates a character named Pandulpho who embodies an idea from the Spanish Tragedy of the Senecan stoic. The Senecan stoic is not ruled by emotions but rather follows a balance of cosmic determinism and human freedom to avoid misfortune. In Hamlet, Shakespeare explores the complexities of the very human desire for revenge in the face of stoic philosophy and ethics. Throughout the play, Hamlet struggles to avenge his father's murder (as has been demanded of him by his father's ghost), and only does so in the end by mischance.\n\nOther play writers of the period questioned the conventions of the genre through parody reversals of generic expectations. In The Revenger's Tragedy, currently ascribed to Thomas Middleton but formerly thought to be by Cyril Tourneur, the revenge character Vindice is a spiteful man whose pleasure in the act of revenge is what seems to be his true motivation for its fulfillment. The Atheist's Tragedy also by Tourneur followed an anti-revenge plot by having Montferrer's ghost explicitly order his son Charlemont not to seek revenge in order to avoid the villainy of violence.\n\nReaction\n\nScholars have examined the themes of the revenge tragedy in the context of the Elizabethan and Jacobean period as a way to understand its rapid growth in popularity. For some, the fact that plays openly question the morality of revenge and taking justice into one's own hands is evidence that the public was morally opposed to the concept. For others, however, the popularity of the genre is evidence that the plays expressed the frustrations and desires for justice against oppressive governance of the public.\n\nIn other medias\n\nNumerous adaptations have been made of revenge plays. Excluding films based on Hamlet, these include:\nJulie Taymor's Titus\nAlex Cox's Revengers Tragedy\nMarcus Thompson's Middleton's Changeling\nPeter Greenaway's The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover and Lars von Trier's Dogville are original works in the revenge-play style.\nTodd Field's In the Bedroom\nPark Chan-wook's Oldboy\nFor music, Sound Horizon's M\u00e4rchen is an original work which has revenge tragedies as its central theme.\n\nFor anime series based on manga, Redo of Healer is a revenge fantasy about Keyaru, who is exploited and sexually abused repeatedly by others due to being a healing hero, a premise as an example of revenge genre due to its numerous depictions of graphic violence and sexual content, including rape, torture, and cannibalism.\n\nFor the video games, The Last of Us Part II much more used of violent themes throughout the entire plot as an example of revenge video game.\n\nReferences\n\nEnglish Renaissance plays\nEnglish drama\nBritish drama\nTragedies (dramas)\nTheatrical genres\nLiterature of England", "The South Platte Formation is a Mesozoic geologic formation found in the U.S. state of Colorado.

Based in Montreal, Quebec, the group consists of wife-and-husband duo Marie Davidson and Pierre Guerineau.\n\nHistory\nThe duo formed in the summer of 2010, releasing a guitar-oriented four-song cassette EP in the following year on their own T\u00e9m\u00e9raire Records. Their following releases, a 2012 split with Hobo Cubes and Tout est jeune EP, showcased an electronic-oriented sound. In 2013, Malditos Records and Teenage Menopause Records co-released the compilation Nuit de noce, which featured the tracks from the previous cassettes, as well as an unreleased track, in vinyl format. A split EP with Police des moeurs and the 7\" single \"Danse sociale\" were issued in 2014 and 2015, respectively.\n\nIn 2016, Essaie pas released its debut studio album, Demain est une autre nuit, on DFA Records. The album was longlisted for 2016 Polaris Music Prize. Its follow-up record, New Path, was announced in early 2018 and was released on DFA later that year. An accompanying music video for the album track, \"Complet Brouill\u00e9\" was also produced. In 2019, the band issued Earth EP, which they regarded as \"a tribute to late 1990s, early 2000s pop trance tracks.\"\n\nMusical style and lyrics\nEssaie pas's music has been described as electronic, minimal synth-pop and cold wave. Considered to be among the \"contemporary groups reviving the DIY minimal synth sound of the 70s and 80s,\" the band combines \"dark, minimal synth pop, French pop, Italo-disco, and elements of horror movie soundtracks.\" Their lyrics, spoken and sung both by Davidson and Guerineau largely in French, feature themes such as loneliness, sexuality, and fantasy. The band's sophomore album, New Path drew on the themes of \"personal ground, on addiction, loss and the lingering strength of identity within late capitalism\u2019s mass media paranoia.\"\n\nThe band's debut, Demain est une autre nuit was compared to \"Giorgio Moroder and John Carpenter film scores as well as the industrial synth pop of Chris & Cosey,\" as well as Davidson's minimal wave solo work.  The band's sound also drew comparisons to the early Human League, \"Sensoria\"-era Cabaret Voltaire and darkwave acts such as Xeno & Oaklander and Cold Cave. New Path, which featured \"English and French lyrics, techno beats and fear-inducing soundscapes,\" was heavily influenced by Philip K. Dick's 1977 novel, A Scanner Darkly and borrows its title from the book.\n\nDiscography\nStudio albums\n Demain est une autre nuit (2016)\n New Path (2018)\n\nEPs\n Essaie pas (2011)\n Liaisons dans la nuit / Le fruit des solitudes (2012; split with Hobo Cubes)\n Tout est jeune (2012)\n Police des moeurs / Essaie pas (2014; split with Police des moeurs)\n Demain est une autre nuit (The Remixes) (2016)\n New Path (The Remixes) (2018)\n Earth (2019)\n\nSingles\n \"Danse sociale\" (2015)\n \"Futur parl\u00e9\" (2017)\n\nCompilation\n Nuit de noce (2013)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nCanadian electronic music groups\nCanadian musical duos\nMusical groups from Montreal\nCold wave groups\nMinimal wave groups\nCanadian synthpop groups\nMusical groups established in 2010\n2010 establishments in Quebec\nElectronic music duos\nDFA Records artists\nMale\u2013female musical duos", "Ice on the Dune is the second studio album by Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun, released on 14 June 2013 by Capitol Records. The album was met with generally positive reviews from music critics, with many commenting on the progression of the group's sound from their debut album.\n\nA trailer for the album debuted on 11 March 2013; it was produced by Kelvin Optical, a production division of Bad Robot, and was directed by J. D. Dillard. Along with this, the band released a fictional story related to the album which described a world looked over by an \"Emperor\" and a \"Prophet\".\n\nThe lead single \"Alive\" premiered on 15 April 2013, and the album became available to pre-order on iTunes the same day. The music video for the song, filmed in Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah, was directed by Charles Scott and Alex Theurer and also produced by Kelvin Optical. Both \"DNA\" and \"Celebrate\" were serviced as follow-up singles and were also released as official remix singles on iTunes.\n\nTo promote the album, the duo played a series of US festival dates, and without Nick Littlemore, Luke Steele returned to Australia on 30 May to perform at the Sydney Opera House for Vivid Sydney. The duo performed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on 18 June, marking their first television appearance in the US. The duo also performed at the Australian Splendour in the Grass festival in late July.\n\nThe album's cover art, designed by Aaron Hayward and David Homer from Sydney studio Debaser, won an Artisan Award prior to the ARIA Music Awards of 2013, held on 1 December. In addition, the album was nominated for Best Pop Release, Engineer of the Year (Peter Mayes) and Producer of the Year (Steele, Littlemore, Mayes and Jonathan Sloan). Empire of the Sun were also nominated for Best Group for the album, but did not win.\n\nMusic\n\nThemes\n\nIn an interview with MetroLyrics, Nick Littlemore explained that the writing of the album was influenced by frequent touring and travel and the \"tyranny of distance\", primarily from family. He described the song \"I'll Be Around\" as \"a nice message to each other\u2014to Luke and I, and then to our loved ones and our families and to the audience, that 'we will be around'\".\n\nIn the same interview, Littlemore again reinforced the impact of distance, stating, \"When we came back together, initially it felt like a secret affair and it was great, but then as you run deeper into that relationship again, there were things that we communicated to each other.\" Elaborating, he said, \"We [communicate through] the nature of song. [...] I think there was a large part of what we were writing about was distance and longing, and I guess some way of kind of sending out a message to the wider world, like that there is a force field that protects all of us and no matter where you are, if you feel for someone and they're in your heart, then you're always with them in some sense.\"\n\nExpanding on the meaning behind the album's title to Pigeons and Planes, Luke Steele spoke of it as being \"like an invisible hummingbird with that lyric and melody came in. Ice on the dune. And no one really knew what it meant. It was like ice on the dune and while we were shooting the first video in that canyon, there were these ginormous dunes with slithers of ice. It was serendipitous like ice on the dune.\" Despite being unable to answer what he wanted listeners to take away from the record, Steele did comment that \"the beauty of it is what people get from it [...] People just need to have an open mind when they listen to music.\"\n\nSongs\nThe album opens with the instrumental track \"Lux\", which several critics likened to a Danny Elfman composition with an orchestral and cinematic quality. The song was composed by Henry Hey, whom Littlemore met in New York City through producer Phil Ramone. The second track, \"DNA\", was released as a promotional single around the time of the album's release and contains disco hallmarks as well as \"breezy acoustic strumming and throbbing synths\". Its verses are driven by acoustic guitars and \"melodic synth lines\", before bass-heavy chords are introduced into its chorus, according to MTV News. Critics termed lead single and third track \"Alive\", a synth-pop-based song with elements of house, \"catchy\", with Neil Ashman of Drowned in Sound labelling it as \"life-affirming electro-fuzz\". It was also stated to have a \"schoolyard\" quality. The Observer called both it and following song \"Concert Pitch\" \"deliriously upbeat confections\". Sarah H. Grant of Consequence of Sound likened \"Concert Pitch\" to a \"dance-floor tantrum inspired by the many Neil Tennant had himself\", and the song was also said to contain a \"punchy disco pulse and wistfully breathy chorus\". In an interview with Moshcam, Steele said the song reminded him of Bruce Springsteen and Tom Petty; he composed the song in a Santa Monica hotel room after experiences while in New York: \"I had a real [...] breakdown [...] I was just so confused about [my] whole position in [...] my entertainment/musical life\", pointing out this as the reason for the opening lyric \"I don't wanna be so complicated\".\n\nTitle track \"Ice on the Dune\", a Eurodance-inspired song with \"wistful choruses\", was especially praised by Kevin Catchpole of PopMatters, who observed it as having \"'80s\" vocals and opined it was fitting as the title of the album. Tim Sendra of AllMusic felt it had soft rock influences. Following track \"Awakening\" was also said to contain a disco sound and a \"Donna Summer thump\", while \"I'll Be Around\", a midtempo ballad, was declared \"ethereal\" and \"reverb-swamped\". Steele was praised for his \"delicate vocal approach\" to the song, which Ashman judged was \"oddly redolent of Mew\". The primarily instrumental \"Old Flavours\" was pointed out for its tropical infusions and disco influences. \"Celebrate\" is an electronic rock song set to a dance beat with robotic Auto-Tuned vocals, which was described as a \"throbbing Madonna-inspired club jam\". Subsequent cut \"Surround Sound\" was called \"incredibly bouncy and fun\", and was especially marked for its lyrical content, containing such lines as \"Let's push through four dimensions/'Til our brains turn to jelly\" and \"Meditate with no thinking/Eternally\". Both \"Celebrate\" and \"Disarm\" were singled out as being \"EDM at its warmest-sounding\". Multiple album reviews noted several songs' similarity to Daft Punk tracks, especially \"Awakening\" and \"Celebrate\". Several were noted to have sounds reminiscent of dubstep according to NME, notably \"Concert Pitch\", \"Awakening\" and \"Old Flavours\"; Grant of Consequence of Sound felt much of the album is stylistically rooted in new wave. Another comparison made was album closer \"Keep a Watch\", which features a gospel choir, to David Bowie, often in a negative context. AllMusic's Tim Sendra proclaimed it an \"OTT ballad that ends the album in an overwrought splash of powdery tears\", and Ashman also noted it to be a \"poised piano ballad\" which lapsed into \"overblown histrionics\".\n\nCritical reception\n\nIce on the Dune received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 68, based on 20 reviews. Tim Sendra of AllMusic wrote that the album \"ends up being everything a good modern pop record should be, and then some. The songs have super-sharp choruses, incessantly listenable arrangements built on acoustic, electric, and programmed instruments, and icy-cold but immediate beats\", commending the duo for their \"skill at crafting perfect pop\" and concluding, \"Modern pop doesn't get any better than this.\" Kevin Catchpole of PopMatters commented that \"Empire of the Sun has delivered a well-blended mix of disco, electropop and just plain fun that evokes the greats without copying them outright. That's not an easy trick to pull off, but they do it well and continue towards a bright future with this release.\" The Independent called the album \"[g]orgeous\" and described it as a \"seamless suite of elegiac synth-pop, with fairydust-flecked melodies, a perpetually peaking bass end, chord changes that reach into your heart, and fantasising falsetto vocals.\" Phil Mongredien of The Observer remarked that the album \"takes [Walking on a Dreams] template\u2014naggingly catchy pop given a euphoric dance twist\u2014and marries it to an even stronger set of songs\", adding that \"the second half finds them in more restrained\u2014but no less winning\u2014mood\".\n\nSlant Magazines Kevin Liedel characterised the album as \"both maddeningly bizarre and bewitching, often at the same time\" and wrote, \"Eschewing any signs of trendy alienation, Empire of the Sun would rather just go alien.\" The Guardians Alexis Petridis praised the duo as being \"extremely good at writing euphoric pop melodies\" and dubbed Ice on the Dune \"a pretty impressive pop album\", but stated that \"it's hard not to wonder what might have been had just a bit of the fanciful imagination that goes into the visual side of Empire of the Sun been allowed to seep in.\" Drowned in Sounds Neil Ashman felt that the duo are \"seemingly too content to stick to their template\" and faulted the album for \"the lack of any standout tracks like [...] 'Walking on a Dream' and 'We Are the People'\", concluding, \"Perhaps with a little more nuance they can exploit the potential of their partnership to be one of the most intriguing electro-pop duos around\u2014but on Ice on the Dune that potential remains unrealised.\" Jayson Greene of Pitchfork noted that the album is \"certainly bigger, and more purposefully stadium-scaled, than its predecessor\", while commenting that the duo's \"stuff floats off, and the synths carry the whiff not of a beach breeze but of a department-store escalator.\" Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone expressed, \"The vintage-Daft Punk cheese platter 'Celebrate' and album-ending Bowie joke 'Keep a Watch' are foamy fun, but too often Ice on the Dune just feels like a lobotomy on the dance floor.\" Mark Beaumont of NME opined that the album's \"saving grace is Steele's airy falsetto\", but dismissed his contributions, writing, \"In trying to reinvent himself as a Bowie-esque future-glam Pop Star, he's been sucked into the sub-Gaga blandness of mainstream music, his aesthetic so costume-party comical it's an unknowing pastiche that takes itself far more seriously than even he seems to realise.\"\n\nThe album was named the best pop album of 2013 by iTunes Australia. In addition, Dave DiMartino and Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music both named Ice on the Dune the best album of 2013.\n\nCommercial performance\nIce on the Dune debuted at number 20 on the Billboard 200, number five on the Top Rock Albums chart, and number two on the Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart, selling 16,000 copies in its first week. As of September 2016, the album had sold 73,000 copies in the United States.\n\nTrack listing\n\nPersonnel\nCredits adapted from the liner notes of Ice on the Dune.\n\nMusicians\n\n Henry Hey \u2013 orchestral arrangements \n Brian Kilgore \u2013 percussion ; magic \n Constance Hauman \u2013 vocals \n Ben Witt \u2013 guitar \n Steven V.

She is best known for her work on the independent circuit in England with various promotions including LDN Wrestling, ChickFight and Real Quality Wrestling where she is the current Women's Champion. She also wrestles in America with Shimmer Women Athletes, where she is part of the alliance The International Home Wrecking Crew.\n\nShe has primarily performed as a villainous character, using the gimmick of an arrogant and outspoken individual earning her the name 'Coventry's Loudest'. Fighting Spirit Magazine exclusively named her and early rival Eden Black as \"spearheading a revolution in British wrestling\" with regards to serious female wrestling. In April 2010, Jetta announced after a match in her home town that she would be retiring from wrestling in June of that year.\n\nProfessional wrestling career\n\nMidlands Professional Wrestling (2002\u20132005)\nJetta started her career in 2002 training with the Midlands Professional Wrestling (MPW) training school near where she lived, in her hometown of Coventry. She showed little interest in wrestling until the late '90s wrestling boom in America. She trained under the tutelage of NWA UK Hammerlock veterans Majik and Psycho Steve. Jetta wrestled many matches for MPW, eventually establishing herself as one their most talented performers, mixing it up with both the male and female wrestlers. Although she denies having any influences, having started wrestling so late, she admires World Wrestling Entertainment's Hulk Hogan, as well as British talent Dynamite Kid and World Association of Wrestling's Ricky Knight and Sweet Saraya. Her career was temporarily impeded in July 2005 when she broke both forearms and had to have metal plates inserted, stopping her wrestling for the rest of the year.\n\nLDN Wrestling (2006\u20132009)\nJetta made her television debut on LDN Wrestling in a match against \"The Jezebel\" Eden Black who she would feud with for the next two years across different promotions and continents. The match took place at Caesar\u2019s Beatings on 15 July 2006, in Jezebel's hometown of Romford. Black managed to pick up the victory which did nothing but anger Jetta, who swiftly demanded a rematch. Jetta had her wish on the televised show of 10 September 2006 but she was beaten once again by her rival. Jetta had to wait until Born to be Wyld in November before she could proclaim victory over Eden Black, in a four way elimination match including Skye and Violet. The feud grew into a scheduled mixed tag match at the LDN Anniversary Show including Jetta's manager John Chapman, however the match went to a no contest after Black's partner, JP Monroe, turned on her nine minutes into the match. Skye reclaimed victory from the fatal-four way the following year in a singles match on 14 April. As well taking on, and defeating, male opponent \"Sweet\" Steven Lee, and losing to Sean King in January 2009 Jetta has made a guest appearance commentating for the Capital TV programme.\n\nReal Quality Wrestling (2006\u20132009)\nJetta debuted in the umbrella promotion Real Quality Wrestling (RQW) in August 2006 at Summer Brawl after gaining some notoriety on the wrestling circuit and was put straight into a three-way match for the RQW Women's Championship where she was bested by her nemesis, Eden Black with Sweet Saraya also featuring. In a tag team contest that saw two feuds collide, Jetta teamed with Cheerleader Melissa to take on their respective rivals Black and MsChif in a winning effort. Later on that year, on 16 June, Jetta attempted to gain the RQW Women's Championship from her nemesis in a four-way elimination match, also including Amazing Kong and Wesna that ultimately saw Wesna pick up the victory, winning the title from Eden Black. Jetta made a further attempt for RQW gold  in December by making a backstage assault on Eden Black at Not Just For Christmas, sending a message to champion Wesna and demanding a title shot. The match, refereed by Sweet Saraya at No Pain, No Gain the following month came to an abrupt end when Jetta walked out, resulting in a count out, due to a legitimate injury that caused her to collapse afterwards, she lost a rematch at Athletik Club Wrestling's Riptide II the next month too.\n\nWorld Association of Women's Wrestling\nSweet Saraya's presence as referee harked back to her feud with Jetta in World Association of Women's Wrestling, a promotion under RQW, where Jetta won the WAWW British Championship from Saraya, ostensibly putting her out of action for over six months as a result (this was actually due to an injury during an RQW match with Cheerleader Melissa). Saraya made her return in December 2007, only to see Jetta reclaim the WAWW British Championship. Saraya instantly set her sights on the belt, losing on 24 February by disqualification and on 26 May after being hit by a foreign object from Britani Knight that was meant to help her. Jetta also won a tag match against Saraya and Knight, alongside Jade, thanks to interference from Knight's erstwhile partner Melodi, on 18 May; when Jetta tagged up with Melodi, Saraya and Knight earned the win on 26 May without any interference or disqualifications and Saraya earned a shot at the British Ladies Championship as a result. The two fought in a point-based eight rounds match, with lumberjacks, on Sunday 29 June with Jetta losing 2-1 from a boston crab in the final round and instantly demanded a rematch, blaming distraction from Saraya's husband.\n\nWhen she did not receive a rematch of the British Ladies Championship, she aimed for Saraya's recently won RQW Women's Championship and, in August 2008, competed in a number one contendership three way match under the auspices of Saraya who acted as special guest referee, making the three count to let Jetta beat Britani Knight and Destiny. Her win earned her a place at the following February's WAW 15th Anniversary Show where she won the RQW Women's Championship after some assistance from Britani Knight.\n\nChickFight (2007\u20132008)\nJetta made her ChickFight debut at the Liquid Nightclub in Gloucester on 22 April 2007, at ChickFight VIII. In the first round Jetta won a bout with fellow LDN alumnus Skye, but she fell to Shimmer rival MsChif in the semi finals. Chickfight IX: Our Final Chance took place on 17 July 2007, at the Orpington Halls in Orpington, Kent, otherwise known as the home of IPW:UK. Jetta was eliminated from the tournament in the first round by Blue Nikita.\n\nDespite, or perhaps because of this loss, she is fast becoming the premiere heel of the promotion. At the next event, ChickFight IX.5, she berated the Skegness crowd before viciously defeating Skye in two straight falls. Before the night was over she cost Eden Black her contest with Wesna due to interference, leading to a hastily scheduled match between the pair which quickly degenerated into a ringside brawl before Jetta screwed Black, pinning her using the ropes. To top off an already mischievous evening, Jetta then reported Cheerleader Melissa, who was on already on a warning, to the CF management leading to her suspension. She continued to interfere in others' business at 4 May 2008 CF taping; she came to the ring after Melissa and Wesna's fight, defending the losing Wesna claiming company bias due to Melissa's new television fame (Wesna returned the favour by interrupting Jetta vs Melissa, saving Jetta from the Kudo Driver) and later, as Black was announcing her retirement due to a severe shoulder injury, Jetta interrupted and cut a promo demanding The Jezebel recognise Jetta as the real reason she was retiring, this resulted in the two being booked for the main event on 3 August ChickFight card. The event, hampered by injuries, saw Jetta attempt to send a message to Black by squashing Faith Lehain in twenty-eight seconds early in the show but, despite spending most of the match working on The Jezebel's injured and taped up shoulder, Jetta would tap out to the Garden of Eden after a twenty-minute match.\n\nShimmer Women Athletes (2007\u20132009)\n\nSingles competition\nIn what was probably Jetta's biggest match to date, she put her long standing issues with Eden Black aside and both women represented the United Kingdom in a Shimmer Women Athletes guest match, for Ring of Honor (ROH). The match took place on 4 March 2007 at ROH's Fifth Year Festival Finale in Liverpool, during their tour of the United Kingdom. Jetta and Jezebel were defeated by United States representatives, Sara Del Rey and Allison Danger, but still managed to show a strong effort against the experienced duo. Jetta would return to the promotion across the pond, becoming a regular for Shimmer tapings from October 2007's Volume 15 where she defeated Serena Deeb. Despite a singles loss to Haze, she still impressed as a singles wrestler by winning the Volume 19 battle royal, entering seventh out of twenty one competitors and earning a Shimmer Championship match later on that same evening; the victory was somewhat tainted, though, as rather than eliminate the final competitor, Ariel was merely pulled out by enraged former champion Del Rey. She lost to MsChif's desecrator the championship match late that night.\n\nInternational Home Wrecking Crew\n\nThough she has made some progress as a singles wrestler, Jetta's best-known contribution to Shimmer has been as part of a team. During Volume 16 she fought alongside The Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew (Lacey and Rain), taking the pin from Daizee Haze who had teamed up with \"The Jezebel\" Eden Black and MsChif, who she had defeated in Real Quality Wrestling earlier in the year. Later Lacey and Rain revealed that Jetta had become part of the newly named International Home Wrecking Crew as the proverbial cream in their Oreo. Though they lost their outing as a trio, Lacey soon absented herself from wrestling and just partnering with Rain, the team won against Danyah and Jennifer Blake during Volume 17.\n\nDuring Volume 20 the tag team picked up a victory over Ashley Lane and Nevaeh, sparking a feud between the two teams. The feud heightened in October when Shimmer held a Tag team gauntlet to crown the inaugural Shimmer Tag Team Champions. After defeating The Suicide Blondes (LuFisto and Jennifer Blake), they lost their chance at being inaugural champions by being eliminated by eventual winners Lane and Nevaeh. With the teams evenly matched at a fall each, and the new tag team belts deepening the feud, the two were announced to compete at Volume 23 in a two out of three falls match. The Home Wrecking Crew scored the first fall when Lacey made a shocking return to wrestling after months of being absent and reversed a cradle pin behind the referee's back to help them win the first fall. When the referee tried to eject her she handed him a certified manager license and was allowed to stay at ringside but could not stop Lane from tying the score over Rain. The challengers got the third pinfall when Lacey threw a chain to Jetta and it appeared she had won the championships for the team. However, the match was restarted when the senior official notified the referee and in the end Lane and Nevaeh retained their titles when Nevaeh pinned Jetta. Later in the night the team of Jetta and Rain defeated the team of Nikki Roxx and The Portuguese Princess Ariel. After two Volume of singles action, where Jetta lost to Tenille and defeated Daffney, Jetta and Rain defeated the teams of Rachel Summerlyn and Daffney and Jessie McKay and Tenille as part of Volumes 27 and 28.\n\nJetta and Rain reunited in November 2011 at Women Superstars Uncensored for their iPPV Breaking Barriers II in a fan favourite role, challenging The Boston Shore for the WSU Tag Team titles but they were unsuccessful.\n\nOther media\nJetta has appeared on Sky Digital channel 427, otherwise known as TWC Fight!. She has appeared on the channel for LDN Wrestling, Irish Whip Wrestling, and Real Quality Wrestling. Jetta has also appeared on ABC 7 and Rumble Radio in Chicago as part of Shimmer promotional news features. She has also been interviewed for Fighting Spirit magazine, mainly about her involvement in ChickFight.\n\nPersonal life\nOn 12 December 2020, Jetta confirmed her engagement to a retired wrestler Yasmin Lander, better known by the ring name Charlie Morgan.\n\nChampionships and accomplishments\n Association Biterroise de Catch\n ABC Women's Championship (1 time, current)\n Dragon Pro Wrestling\n Celtic Crown Womens Championship (1 time, inaugural)\n Elite Wrestling Federation\n EWF Joint Championship (1 time) - with Leon Van Owen\n Independent Wrestling Federation\n IWF Women's Championship (1 time)\n International Pro Wrestling: United Kingdom\n IPW:UK Women's Championship (1 time)\n Midlands Professional Wrestling\n Queen of the Ring (3 times)\n Pro-Wrestling: EVE\n Pro-Wrestling: EVE Championship (2 time, current)\n Pro-Wrestling: EVE Tag Team Championship (1 time) \u2013 with Erin Angel\n Pro Wrestling Illustrated\n Ranked No. 29 of the best 50 female singles wrestlers in the PWI Female 50 in 2009\n World Association of Women's Wrestling\n RQW Women's Championship (1 time)\n WAWW British Ladies Championship (1 time)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Jetta on Myspace\n Online World of Wrestling Profile\n Jetta's LDN Wrestling Profile\n Jetta's SLAM Wrestling Profile\n Jetta's Slammin Ladies Profile\n LadySports Interview\n\n1987 births\nEnglish female professional wrestlers\nLiving people\nSportspeople from Coventry\nLGBT professional wrestlers\nEnglish LGBT sportspeople\n21st-century professional wrestlers", "The Huwwara checkpoint or Huwara checkpoint or Hawara checkpoint (, , Makhsom Hawara) is a major Israel Defense Forces checkpoint at one of the four main exits of Nablus. It is located south of the city. It was established on October 2000. The facility was named after the nearby village of Huwara.\n\nHistory\nIn 2002, the checkpoint was open from morning to evening. Later, it remained open 24 hours a day.\nAll vehicles were required to have special permits and be searched.\n\nIn 2008, renovations were carried out to ease the overcrowding.\n\nConditions at Hawara were relaxed in July 2009. The checkpoint was opened to allow pedestrians to cross freely without being searched. Palestinian vehicles have sometimes faced only random inspections.\n\nIn 2011, Israeli newspapers reported that the IDF would remove the checkpoint. According to the Palestinian human rights organization Al-Haq, the checkpoint is still in use as of 2014. According to Btselem, the checkpoint is infrequently in use.\n\nViolent incidents\nOn March 24, 2004 a 16-year-old, Hussam Abdo tried to pass through the checkpoint wearing an explosive belt strapped to his body in an attempted suicide attack.\n\nIn May 2005, a 15-year-old was arrested at the checkpoint with two pipe bombs inside a black bag, apparently instructed to give them to someone in Israel. In November 2007, two Palestinian teenagers were detained for interrogation after they were found to be carrying three bombs. A sapper detonated them without incident.

The 340th Bomb Squadron was involved in combat missions in both the European and Mediterranean theaters from 1942 through 1945. The most notable of these were the Operation Tidal Wave raids on Hitler\u2019s largest oil refinery in Ploie\u0219ti, Romania.

Began upgrading to the new Boeing B-50 Superfortress, an advanced version of the B-29 in 1949. The B-50 gave the unit the capability to  carry heavy loads of conventional weapons faster and farther as well as being designed for atomic bomb missions if necessary.\n\nBy 1951, the emergence of the Soviet Mig-21 interceptor in the skies of North Korea signaled the end of the propeller-driven B-50 as a first-line strategic bomber.  Received B-47 Stratojet jet bombers in 1955 and despite initial difficulties, the Stratojet became the mainstay of the medium-bombing strength of SAC all throughout the 1950s, deployed frequently to North Africa and England for REFLEX exercises.

On 15 August 1973, after months of committing most of the wing's people and resources to the conflict, crew E-21 had the distinction of flying the last B-52 mission over a target in Cambodia. This marked the end of the United States' strategic bombing in Southeast Asia. Crews returned to the United States to training and alert status.\n\nDeployed aircraft and crews to the 806th Bombardment Wing (Provisional) at RAF Fairford, England in February 1991, engaging in combat operations over Iraq and Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm.

After the panelists made their guesses who he was, none of which was correct, he unmasked himself as singer Donnie Wahlberg, panelist Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg's husband, shocking McCarthy Wahlberg who did not recognize his voice.  \n\nKermit the Frog (\"Snail\") is the first fictional character to have competed on the American version of The Masked Singer and \"Russian Dolls\" (Hanson) are the second costume to feature more than one person (the first being Clint and Lisa Black's \"Snow Owls\" costume from the previous season) and the first costume to feature a group of different celebrities.\n\n(WC) This masked singer is a wildcard contestant.\n\nEpisodes\n\nWeek 1 (March 10)\n\nWeek 2 (March 17)\n\nWeek 3 (March 24)\n\nWeek 4 (March 31)\n\nWeek 5 (April 7)\n\nWeek 6 (April 14)\n\nWeek 7 (April 21)\n\nWeek 8 (May 5)\n\nWeek 9 (May 12)\n\nWeek 10 (May 19)\n\nWeek 11 (May 26) \u2013 Finale\nGroup performance: \"How Do I Live\" by LeAnn Rimes\n\nRatings\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n2021 American television seasons\nThe Masked Singer (American TV series)", "Our Aim Is to Satisfy est un album de Red Snapper, sorti en 2000.\n\nL'album \n\nLeanne Alberghini \u00e9crit de celui-ci : .\n\nIl fait partie des 1001 albums qu'il faut avoir \u00e9cout\u00e9s dans sa vie.\n\nTitres \nTous les titres sont de Ali Friend et Richard Thair. \n\n Keeping Pigs Together (5:24)\n Some Kind of Kink (5:26)\n Shellback (5:44)\n Don't Go Nowhere (4:50)\n The Rake (5:14)\n The Rough and the Quick (5:06)\n Bussing (5:24)\n I Stole Your Car (4:17)\n Alaska Street (5:01)\n Belladonna (4:27)\n They're Hanging Me Tonight (6:07)\n\nMusiciens \n\n David Ayers : guitare\n Ali Friend : basse \u00e9lectrique, contrebasse\n Karime Kendra : voix\n Richard Thair : batterie, platines\n\nNotes et r\u00e9f\u00e9rences\n\nLien externe \n\n Allmusic\n\nAlbum musical sorti en 2000\nAlbum d'acid jazz", "Prolita incicur is a moth of the family Gelechiidae.

She grew up in Manhattan and Brookline, Massachusetts, and started in theater by sweeping stage floors and acting in summer stock performances. In 1945, while still in her teens, she became the producer of Blue Holiday, an all-black Broadway variety show that ran for eight performances at the Belasco Theater, starring Katherine Dunham, Ethel Waters and Josh White.\n\nCareer \nShe married Gerald M. Abrahams, the chairman of the luxury clothing manufacturer Aquascutum and returned with him to London. There, the elaborate parties she prepared for her husband's clients allowed her to join with Oscar Lewenstein Productions, where she was involved with plays such as Semi-Detached with Laurence Olivier, as well as the Albert Finney vehicles Billy Liar as Luther. She started Albion Productions in the mid-1960s, putting on a total of eight plays in the West End theatre, among them Tom Stoppard's Enter a Free Man in 1968 and Travesties in 1974.\n\nReturning to New York City and Broadway in 1974, she co-produced Equus with Kermit Bloomgarden at the Plymouth Theatre. Starring Anthony Hopkins as the psychiatrist with a patient who has a pathological  obsession with horses, it was honored as best play at the 29th Tony Awards and the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play went to John Dexter. Her 1975 Broadway production of Travesties, co-produced with Burry Fredrik and David Merrick, won that year's Tony Award for best play.\n\nPersonal life \nAbrahams died there at age 88 on February 17, 2009, due to heart failure in Manhattan. She was survived by two daughters, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

He was credited with 12 official aerial victories during the First World War. During World War II, he returned to his country's service, not retiring until 1954.\n\nEarly life\n\nNorman William Reginald Mawle was born in Banbury on 27 February 1897.\n\nWorld War I\n\nCadet Norman Mawle of the Inns of Court Officers' Training Corps was commissioned as a second lieutenant on 5 September 1916. He was seconded as a flying officer to the Royal Flying Corps on 27 December 1917. He was attached to No. 5 Squadron RFC for five weeks. Mawle was promoted to lieutenant on 5 March 1918.\n\nOn 22 May 1918, Mawle was assigned to No. 84 Squadron RAF as a Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5 pilot. His original assigned aircraft was substandard, and he would not have success until it was wrecked by another pilot, and replaced. Using SE.5 serial number D6917, he destroyed a German observation balloon at Proyart for his first victory, on 17 July 1918. Three days later, he busted another balloon and destroyed a Fokker D.VII. A broken connecting rod in the engine moved Mawle out of his customary plane into SE.5 serial number C1868; on 24 July, he used it to team with Captain John Ralston to destroy a Fokker D.VII over Warfus\u00e9e.\n\nOnce back in his familiar machine, he helped destroy an LVG reconnaissance plane on 29 July 1918 for his fifth win. The following day, he drove one Fokker D.VII spinning down out of control. Two other Fokker D.VIIs in the fight collided and went down; they were credited to Mawle. On 4 August, he destroyed another balloon. Three days later, Mawle destroyed a Fokker D.VII and drove another down out of control. The following day, he burned a German balloon for his twelfth and final victory. While strafing two horse-drawn German balloons, Mawle was severely wounded in the stomach and arm by ground fire. He managed to return to base, but was removed from combat duty.\n\nOn 2 November 1918, Mawle received the Distinguished Flying Cross for his exploits. His citation read:\nLieutenant Norman William Reginald Mawle (London Regiment)\n\"A courageous and skillful leader, who has destroyed nine enemy machines and four kite balloons. While leading his patrol of five scouts, he observed a hostile formation of fifteen scouts. Nothing daunted by the disparity in numbers, he at once engaged them, driving down three himself. During a recent patrol he engaged two kite balloons, one of which he shot down in flames at 25 feet altitude. Later, he attacked an anti-tank gun, stampeding the horses and causing the gun to overturn in a ditch. In this patrol he was seriously wounded, but flew his machine back to his aerodrome.\"\n\nBetween the wars\nIn November 1934, Mawle was executor on an estate in Hounslow; his address was given as Oadby, Leicestershire.\n\nWorld War II and beyond\nMawle was promoted from flight lieutenant to squadron leader and simultaneously transferred from No. 913 (County of Warwick) Balloon Squadron AAF to command of No. 911 (County of Warwick) Balloon Squadron AAF on 6 June 1939. On 1 September 1941, Mawle was promoted to temporary wing commander in the Balloon Branch of the Auxiliary Air Force of the Royal Air Force after being appointed Commanding Officer of RAF Norton, Sheffield, which was the home of 16 Balloon Centre tasked with defending Sheffield and Rotherham. As of 1 July 1942, he dropped the \"temporary\" designation. On 24 April 1944, Mawle transferred to administrative duties.\n\nMawle retired from the Royal Auxiliary Air Force on 10 February 1954, as a wing commander retaining the rank of group captain.\n\nMawle was serving as a magistrate and as Chairman of the West Bromwich Savings Committee, when he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1962 Birthday Honours.\n\nEndnotes\n\nReferences\n\n1897 births\n1971 deaths\nMilitary personnel from Oxfordshire\nPeople from Banbury\nLondon Regiment officers\nBritish Army personnel of World War I\nBritish World War I flying aces\nRoyal Air Force personnel of World War II\nRecipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)\nOfficers of the Order of the British Empire", "The Jewish courtyard in Speyer (also known as the Speyer Jewry-Court), is an historic and archeological site located in the inner city of Speyer, Germany. Built in stages between 1104 (when the synagogue was consecrated) and the 14th century, the courtyard contains some of the oldest and best-preserved Jewish community buildings. Along with the other ShUM-cities of Worms and Mainz, Speyer was the hometown of one of the most important Jewish communities in Middle Ages in northern Europe. Because of its historical importance and its testimony to the European Jewish cultural tradition, the Jewish courtyard was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2021.\n\nDescription\nThe Jewish courtyard consists of the remains of the synagogue, its courtyard, and the women's shul (prayer room), an intact Mikvah for ritual washing, and a yeshiva for teaching and studying. The synagogue, courtyard, and mikvah were constructed in the early 12th century using sandstone, and the women's shul and yeshiva were built out of brick in the 13th and 14th centuries. The synagogue was built in the Romanesque style and is the oldest example of the window arrangement that would become commonplace in Ashkenazi Jewish architecture, with arched windows surrounding a central round window. When it was remodeled, it retained most of its Romanesque features. The women's shul, attached to the south side of the synagogue, was built in high Gothic style with a ribbed vault ceiling. The north and east walls of the yeshiva are the only above-ground aspect that still exist today. However, it is clear that the yeshiva was built in a similar style to the women's shul.\n\nLocated to the east of the synagogue, the mikvah was built in the Romanesque style and contains elaborate sculpting and masonry. In particular, the anteroom overlooking the ritual bath contains intricate stonework, with a four-part window wall and ornate capitals. The same stonemasons who built the synagogue and mikvah also likely worked on the Christian churches and cathedrals in Speyer.\n\nHistory\n\nIn the late 11th century, Jews fleeing persecution in the town of Mainz began to take refuge in Speyer. In 1084, the Bishop of Speyer, R\u00fcdiger Huzmann, issued a letter of protection for the fledgling Jewish community, intending to grow the economy of Speyer. This protection was later expanded by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor in 1090, beginning a \"golden age\" of Judaism in Speyer. \n\nThe oldest building in the Jewish courtyard is synagogue, which was consecrated on 21 September 1104. The first documented mention of the Mikvah was in 1126, making it the earliest documented mikvah in Europe, and its subterranean components have been nearly unmodified for centuries. In 1196, the synagogue was burnt in a pogrom and was subsequently reconstructed. In the mid 13th century, the synagogue was renovated in Gothic style and the women's synagogue was built next to it. Finally, the mid-14th century, the yeshiva was constructed. \n  \nThe Jewish community in Speyer existed until the beginning of the 16th century. The exact time and circumstances of the destruction are unknown. The synagogue was used for an armory by Speyer until the city was destroyed in 1689 during the Nine Years' War. Afterwards, the buildings in the Jewish courtyard were leased out for building huts, and then was divided into residential allotments before 1999 when the city of Speyer bought the area and removed the non-medieval buildings.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n\nSpeyer\nHistoric Jewish communities in Europe\nBuildings and structures in Rhineland-Palatinate\nWorld Heritage Sites in Germany", "State Highway 30 (SH\u00a030), alternatively known as Hampden Avenue, Havana Street, 6th Avenue, and Gun Club Road is a state route in the independent city and county of Denver and the city of Aurora in Arapahoe County. Its west end is at Interstate 25 (I-25) and U.S. Route 285 (US 285) in Denver and its east end is at Quincy Avenue east of Aurora.\n\nRoute description\n\nThe route begins at I-25 and US 285 in Denver. It then winds eastward and exits Denver and enters Arapahoe at about 2.0 miles, then reenters Denver at about 2.3 miles. At 2.6 miles, the route changes direction to north and crosses SH 83 at 3.8 miles, where it again leaves Denver and enters Arapahoe County and Aurora. It continues northward, crosses the Highline Canal, and at 7.8 miles it then turns east again. At about 10 miles, it traverses across I-225. It then continues eastward, and forms the northern and eastern border for Buckley Space Force Base. It further leaves the Aurora city limit at about 18.3 miles, and finally ends at Quincy Avenue east of Aurora, adjacent to Exit 13 on E-470.\n\nHistory\n\nThe route was established in 1955, when it began at SH 70 (deleted) southeastward to today's terminus. The southern terminus was moved to Smoky Hill Road by 1960 and to Quincy Avenue by 1966, when the road entirely paved.

He is known for the Hanle effect. During World War II, he made contributions to the German nuclear energy project, also known as the Uranium Club. From 1941 until emeritus status in 1969, he was an ordinarius professor of experimental physics and held the chair of physics at the University of Giessen.\n\nEducation\nHanle was born in Mannheim. From 1919 to 1924, he studied at the Ruprecht-Karls-Universit\u00e4t Heidelberg and the Georg-August-Universit\u00e4t G\u00f6ttingen. Philipp Lenard, Director of the Physikalische Institut (Physics Institute) at Heidelberg, had a dictatorial attitude towards his students and colleagues, and Hanle had a conflict with Lenard. Hanle transferred to G\u00f6ttingen. In 1923, Hanle conducted an experiment which demonstrated the variation of polarization of the resonance fluorescent light from a mercury vapor in a weak magnetic field; this became known as the \"Hanle effect\". He received his doctorate at G\u00f6ttingen in 1924, under James Franck, who as Director of the II. Physikalisches Institut (Second Physical Institute).\n\nCareer\n\nHanle was a teaching assistant at the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1924 and at the Eberhard-Karls-Universit\u00e4t T\u00fcbingen in 1925. He was at the Martin-Luther-Universit\u00e4t Halle-Wittenberg from 1926 to 1929, and, upon completion of his Habilitation, he became a Privatdozent (unpaid lecturer) there in 1927. From 1929, he was an ausserordentlicher Professor (extraordinarius professor) and head of the physics department at the Friedrich-Schiller-Universit\u00e4t Jena.\n\nAt Jena, Georg Joos was professor of theoretical physics, but in 1935, he made a compulsory transfer to head the Second Physical Institute at G\u00f6ttingen to replace James Franck, who had resigned as a result of the Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service in 1933. Hanle and Joos would soon be part of the impetus to initiate the German nuclear energy project, shortly after Hanle went to G\u00f6ttingen. From 1937 to 1941, Hanle was again at the University of G\u00f6ttingen.\n\nIn December 1938, the German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann sent a manuscript to Naturwissenschaften reporting they had detected the element barium after bombarding uranium with neutrons; simultaneously, they communicated these results to Lise Meitner, who had in July of that year fled to The Netherlands and then went to Sweden. Meitner, and her nephew Otto Robert Frisch, correctly interpreted these results as being nuclear fission. Frisch confirmed this experimentally on 13 January 1939.\n\nPaul Harteck was director of the physical chemistry department at the University of Hamburg and an advisor to the Heereswaffenamt (HWA, Army Ordnance Office). On 24 April 1939, along with his teaching assistant Wilhelm Groth, Harteck made contact with the Reichskriegsministerium (RKM, Reich Ministry of War) to alert them to the potential of military applications of nuclear chain reactions. Two days earlier, on 22 April 1939, after hearing a colloquium paper by Hanle on the use of uranium fission in a Uranmaschine (uranium machine, i.e., nuclear reactor), Georg Joos, along with Hanle, notified Wilhelm Dames, at the Reichserziehungsministerium (REM, Reich Ministry of Education), of potential military applications of nuclear energy. The communication was given to Abraham Esau, head of the physics section of the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council) at the REM. On 29 April, a group, organized by Esau, met at the REM to discuss the potential of a sustained nuclear chain reaction.  The group included the physicists Walther Bothe, Robert D\u00f6pel, Hans Geiger, Wolfgang Gentner (probably sent by Walther Bothe), Wilhelm Hanle, Gerhard Hoffmann, and Georg Joos; Peter Debye was invited, but he did not attend. After this, informal work began at G\u00f6ttingen by Joos, Hanle, and their colleague Reinhold Mannfopff; the group of physicists was known informally as the first Uranverein (Uranium Club) and formally as Arbeitsgemeinschaft f\u00fcr Kernphysik. The group's work was discontinued in August 1939, when the three were called to military training.\n\nThe second Uranverein began after the HWA squeezed out the RFR of the REM and started the formal German nuclear energy project under military auspices. The second Uranverein was formed on 1 September 1939, the day World War II began, and it had its first meeting on 16 September 1939. The meeting was organized by Kurt Diebner, advisor to the HWA, and held in Berlin. The invitees included Walther Bothe, Siegfried Fl\u00fcgge, Hans Geiger, Otto Hahn, Paul Harteck, Gerhard Hoffmann, Josef Mattauch, and Georg Stetter. A second meeting was held soon thereafter and included Klaus Clusius, Robert D\u00f6pel, Werner Heisenberg, and Carl Friedrich von Weizs\u00e4cker. Also at this time, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institut f\u00fcr Physik (KWIP, Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physics, after World War II the Max Planck Institute for Physics), in Berlin-Dahlem, was placed under HWA authority, with Diebner as the administrative director, and the military control of the nuclear research commenced.\n\nHanle contributed to the Uranverein under the auspices of the HWA with experimental studies which showed that boron and cadmium were strong absorbers of thermal neutrons.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1969, Hanle was an ordentlicher Professor (ordinarius professor) of experimental physics and held the chair of physics at the Justus Liebig-Universit\u00e4t Gie\u00dfen. Hanle made significant contributions to the rebuilding of the university after World War II.\n\nHonors\n\nHanle received a number of honors, including:\n\n1970 \u2013 Honorary Doctor of Engineering from the University of Stuttgart\n1987 \u2013 Honorary Senator of the University of Giessen for his work in reconstruction of the university after World War II\n\nInternal Report\n\nThe following was published in Kernphysikalische Forschungsberichte (Research Reports in Nuclear Physics), an internal publication of the German Uranverein.  Reports in this publication were classified Top Secret, they had very limited distribution, and the authors were not allowed to keep copies.  The reports were confiscated under the Allied Operation Alsos and sent to the United States Atomic Energy Commission for evaluation.  In 1971, the reports were declassified and returned to Germany. The reports are available at the Karlsruhe Nuclear Research Center and the American Institute of Physics.\n\nWilhelm Hanle \u00dcber den Nachweis von Bor und Cadmium in Kohle G-85 (18 April 1941)\n\nBooks\n\nWilhelm Hanle Die Erde im Strahlungsfeld von Sonne und Kosmos (Schmitz, 1948)\nWilhelm Hanle Atomenergie (Schmitz, 1949)\nWilhelm Hanle K\u00fcnstliche Radioaktivit\u00e4t (Piscator-Verl., 1952)\nUlrich Jetter and Wilhelm Hanle Atomwaffen, Anwendung, Wirkungsweise, Schutzmassnahmen (Physik-Verl., 1952)\nKarl Lindackers, Wilhelm Hanle, and Max Pllermann Praktische Durchf\u00fchrung von Abschirmungsberechnungen (Hanser, Carl GmbH + Co., 1962)\nWilhelm Hanle Isotopentechnik (Thiemig, 1964)\nWilhelm Hanle, Martin Oberhofer, and Wolfgang Jacobi Strahlenschutzpraxis.

It was based on part of the diary of Bremer, the would-be assassin of Alabama governor George Wallace. Bremer shot Wallace on May 15, 1972, at the Laurel Shopping Center in Laurel, Maryland, while Wallace was in the midst of his third campaign for President.\n\nIn the book, Bremer says he was not particularly opposed to Wallace's political agenda, which many had branded as white supremacist; his primary motive was to become famous as he had also stalked President Richard Nixon.\n\nPaul Schrader was partly inspired by Bremer's diary when he wrote the screenplay for the 1976 film Taxi Driver, which was directed by Martin Scorsese. Peter Gabriel's 1980 song \"Family Snapshot,\" from Peter Gabriel (III) was inspired by An Assassin's Diary.\n\nReviews\nIn the essay \"The Art and Arts of E.

It was formed by the construction of Gardiner Dam and the Qu'Appelle River Dam across the South Saskatchewan and Qu'Appelle Rivers respectively. Construction began in 1959 and the lake was filled in 1967. The lake is  long with approximately  of shoreline. It has a maximum depth of , while the water levels regularly fluctuate 3\u20139 metres (9\u201327\u00a0feet) each year. Lake Diefenbaker provides water for domestic irrigation and town water supplies. The flow of the two rivers is now regulated with a considerable portion of the South Saskatchewan diverted into the Qu'Appelle. Prior to the dams' construction, high water levels in the South Saskatchewan would frequently cause dangerous ice conditions downstream in Saskatoon while the Qu'Appelle would frequently dry up in the summer months.\n\nLake Diefenbaker is the largest body of water in southern Saskatchewan, although Last Mountain Lake is the largest naturally occurring one. The lake was named after John G. Diefenbaker, a former Prime Minister of Canada.\n\nRecreation \n\nThree provincial parks and four regional parks are located on the shores of Lake Diefenbaker: Danielson Provincial Park, Douglas Provincial Park, Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park, Palliser Regional Park, Outlook Regional Park, Cabri Regional Park, and Prairie Lake Regional Park.\n\nRecreational activities include fishing, boating, and camping. The town of Elbow contains a marina for boat storage and house boat rental.\n\nThe only remaining ferry on the lake is the Riverhurst Ferry, a cable ferry that operates across Lake Diefenbaker near Riverhurst, Saskatchewan.\n\nEcology \nLake Diefenbaker is home to 26 native and stocked fish species. These include burbot, walleye, northern pike, lake whitefish, lake trout, sauger, goldeye, cisco, yellow perch, rainbow trout, lake sturgeon, longnose sucker, white sucker, shorthead redhorse and Atlantic Salmon. Both the current world-record rainbow trout and world-record burbot were caught in the lake. The lake itself along with Battle Creek are the only two bodies of water in Saskatchewan that support a reproducing population of rainbow trout.\n\nThe lake's sandy beaches provide appropriate habitat for the nationally endangered piping plover.\n\nThe long stretches of open water and poorly consolidated shore materials makes the shores vulnerable to erosion. Between 1968 and 1992 bank recession rates have commonly ranged up to  a year with higher rates in exposed areas.\n\nImportant Bird Areas \nThere two Important Bird Areas (IBA) of Canada on Lake Diefenbaker, with one at each end.\n\nGalloway and Miry Bay (SK006) is located at the western end of the lake about  north of Cabri. The IBA site includes the shoreline and spans the width of the lake covering an area of . Miry Bay is located on the western shore and Galloway is on the eastern shore about  to the north. Geese found in Miry and Galloway Bays include the greater white-fronted, snow, and Ross's. Sandhill cranes are also found at the site.\n\nEast Lake Diefenbaker (SK055) is located at the eastern end of the lake. It totals  and encompasses most of both the Gordon McKenzie and Thomson Arms of the lake. This IBA is designated as critical piping plover habitat.\n\nSee also \nList of lakes of Saskatchewan\nList of dams and reservoirs in Canada\nList of generating stations in Saskatchewan\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nLake Diefenbaker Tourism Inc.\nWater Management\n Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan\n Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan.

It is endemic to the Transverse Ranges of southern California, where it grows in several types of habitat, including pine forest. This is a perennial herb producing a low mat of hairy, glandular gray-green foliage around a woody base. The leaves are mostly flat and made up of pairs of hairy, wedge-shaped leaflets with toothed tips. The inflorescence is an open array of up to 40 flowers atop an erect stalk, each flower made up of five pointed green sepals and five white petals. At the center of the flower is a cone of 10 stamens around a bunch of up to 50 pistils.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nJepson Manual Treatment\nPhoto gallery\n\nrydbergii\nFlora of California", "Robert of Ropsley was an important household knight who had a close relationship with John, King of England\n\nOrigins \nHe was the leader of a minor knightly family in Lincolnshire owing fealty to William d'Albini of Bevoir.\n\nLife and career \nHe was constable of Bristol castle from August 1204 to March 1208. From July 1207 to sometime in 1210 he held the castle of Kenilworth Castle, an extremely important castle as it controlled the trade routes to Coventry and was an important administrative center in Warwickshire. In 1207 he was appointed itinerant justice in Warwickshire. It is known that he held the Honour (Barony) of Leicester as custodian in 1205-1209 along with the archdeacon of Staffordshire. He was sheriff of Warwickshire and Leicestershire between 1212 and 1215. It is likely that Robert had considerable control in Leicestershire given the fact that he was custodian between 1205 and 1209 and thus had the chance to establish himself as a powerful player within the shire.\n\nIn 1215 he was among the representatives sent to Otto of Brunswick along with Robert of Burgate. During King John's reign Robert is recorded as having witnessed 20 charters, an indication that he was at the kings side in intervals and he was an important member of John's court. Shortly after June 14, 1215 he had defected to the barons side in the Second Barons War despite his close relationship with king John. This was because he held some of his lands from or near rebels: William d'Albini of Belvoir and some lands in the richmong honour. Despite four letters offering safe conduct to Robert if he would rejoin the royal cause, he was a rebel through and through after 1215.\n\nFiefs \nFrom William d'Albini of Belvoir:\n\nManor of Ropsley - Lincolnshire\n\nFrom The Barons of Richmond:\n\nManor of Frampton - Lincolnshire Manor of Donington - Lincolnshire\n\nFamily \nHe married Mabel de Limsey daughter of Gerard de Limsey and widow of Hugh Bardulf.

The band's style was self-defined by the members themselves as \"Musica Melodica Emiliana\u2014Punk Filosovietico\" (\"Emilian Melodic Music\u2014pro-Soviet punk\")\n\nTheir name, CCCP, stems from the cyrillic script for SSSR, Russian acronym for the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, although pronounced following the Italian phonetics.\n\nCCCP left behind the stereotypes of punk rock, and reached for a genre-defying convergence of militant rock, industrial music, folk, electropop, Middle Eastern music, and even chamber music while delivering through their lyrics a bleak vision of humankind, also introducing elements of expressionist theatre and existentialist philosophy in their live shows.\n\nCCCP's works influenced dozen of artists such as Marlene Kuntz, Massimo Volume, and Offlaga Disco Pax.\n\nHistory\n\n1981\u20131983: Formation\n\nCCCP was formed in 1981 when Ferretti met Zamboni (both were from Reggio Emilia) in a discoth\u00e8que in Kreuzberg (Berlin). Once they returned home they founded a new band called MitropaNK. During the following summer Ferretti, Zamboni and bassist Umberto Negri returned to Berlin: it was during that trip that CCCP Fedeli alla Linea were born. The band members decided to use a drum machine instead of an actual drummer.\n\nThe name of the band celebrates the popular sub-culture of Emilia while also praising the Soviet Union, creating a link between Russia and the typical province of Emilia-Romagna.\n\nDuring this period the band performed several times in Germany, playing some underground clubs in Berlin such as the Kob or the Spectrumin. Their permanence in Berlin influenced the sound of the band through the local industrial scene. East Berlin's culture and the Islamic community of the West side of the town also influenced Ferretti's lyrics.\n\nThe band's first concerts in Italy were met with a negative response from the crowd, leading the band to add two new members to the line-up: Annarella Giudici \"Benemerita soubrette\" (well-deserved soubrette), and a performer named Danilo Fatur. Annarella, Fatur, and for a little time Silvia Bonvicini (a second \"Benemerita soubrette\") contributed to characterize their concerts by playing comic-demential sketches during their gigs.\n\n1984\u20131985: First EPs\nIn 1984 the band released Ortodossia, their first EP on the independent label Attack Punk Records. In the same year theOrtodossia II EP was released, which included the same three songs already included in their first EP (\"Live in Pankow\", \"Spara Jurij\", and \"Punk Islam\") plus an additional fourth track (\"Mi ami?\"). 1985 saw the release of their third EP, Compagni, Cittadini, Fratelli, Partigiani.\n\nThe three EPs were produced and recorded by the band with very little money and few musical instruments in a single room set as a recording studio, near to a city tram line constantly disturbing the recording.\n\n1986: Debut album\nTheir first studio album, 1964/1985 Affinit\u00e0-Divergenze fra il Compagno Togliatti e Noi - Del Conseguimento della Maggiore Et\u00e0, was recorded during 1985 and published by Attack Punk Records in 1986. It reduced the visceral impact of hardcore while focusing on the eerie contrast between a harsh but spare instrumental background and Ferretti's delirious cut-up lyrics and Brecht-ian delivery. An eclectic stylistic range (from existential psychodrama to dance groove, from erotic cabaret to folk ballad) helped craft an oppressive atmosphere of angst and boredom, particularly in the centerpiece, \"Emilia Paranoica\".\n\nThis album is considered by many music critics one of the masterpieces of contemporary Italian music, and a milestone for the whole European punk movement. The album's sales induced Virgin Dischi, the Italian branch of Virgin to sign the band. Some of the band's fans saw this move as betrayal and nicknamed the band \"CCCP fedeli alla lira\" with lira (the old Italian currency before the introduction of Euro) instead of linea ('line' in the sense of 'party line', in line with the soviet theme).\n\n1987\u20131988: Signed for Virgin\nIn 1987 the band recorded and released their first single Oh! Battagliero and their second album, Socialismo e Barbarie, which was made with a relatively big budget if compared with the first one. It is a less cohesive work, that ran the gamut from Middle Eastern music to a rock version of the Soviet anthem, from Catholic hymns to feedback workouts.\n\nIn 1988 Virgin re-released Socialismo e Barbarie on CD, and their first EPs on the compilation Compagni, cittadini, fratelli, partigiani / Ortodossia II.\n\nIn the same year, CCCP released the single Tomorrow (Voulez vous un rendez vous), a cover version of a song by the singer and painter Amanda Lear; Amanda Lear sang on both the two tracks of the single.\n\n1989: Third album\nThe third album, Canzoni, Preghiere, Danze del II Millennio - Sezione Europa (1989), signs their musical change to electropop. Keyboard, instead of guitar, became the most important instrument. Their sound is now influenced by Middle Eastern music and is softer than in the previous records. It replaces the original sociopolitical emphasis with mystical overtones, and their industrial hardcore with a far less revolutionary synthpop.\n\n1989\u20131990: Litfiba and demise\nIn 1989 CCCP, Litfiba, and Rats went on tour in the Soviet Union (Moscow and Leningrad). In Moscow they played in a palace full of soldiers in uniform. The soldiers stood up when the band played at the end of the concert the Soviet hymn \"A Ja Ljublju SSSR\". \n\nDuring this year guitarist Giorgio Canali, bassist Gianni Maroccolo, keyboardist Francesco Magnelli, and drummer Ringo De Palma (the last three left the Litfiba because of some artistical difference of opinion with band's manager Alberto Pirelli) joined and transformed the group.\n\nThe group, now composed by eight members, recorded their fourth album Epica Etica Etnica Pathos in an abandoned 700' villa. This album signes another musical evolution for the band. CCCP reached their zenith with this album, a Frank Zappa-esque stylistic puzzle which also stands as a personal musical encyclopedia, with complex suites such as \"MACISTE contro TUTTI\", their \"swan song\", and a transition to the new sonorities of the Consorzio Suonatori Indipendenti (C.S.I.), the new band born from the ashes of CCCP.\n\nThe acronym used for the new band name, C.S.I., reminds to the new situation in the Soviet Union, with the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) ( (CSI)). With the creation of the CIS, the Soviet Union and at the same time the band ceased to exist.\n\nCCCP effectively disbanded the 3 October 1990, in the same date of the German reunification, and the members went on to other projects.\n\nPost-CCCP \nWhen the Soviet Union collapsed, Ferretti and Zamboni decided to shuffle the line-up and adopt a less political stance. The renamed Consorzio Suonatori Indipendenti (C.S.I.) debuted with a set of songs from Ko del Mondo (Polygram, 1993). They rapidly evolved towards a form of chamber rock music (mostly drum-less) with Linea Gotica (Polygram, 1996).\n\nWhen C.S.I. disbanded in 1999, Ferretti debuted solo with Co-dex (2000), then formed Per Grazia Ricevuta (PGR) and released PGR (2002) that steered towards world-music.\n== Members ==\n Giovanni Lindo Ferretti (Cerreto Alpi, 9 September 1953): songwriter, vocals (1982\u20131990)\n Massimo Zamboni (Reggio Emilia, 1957): guitar, songwriter (1982\u20131990)\n Umberto Negri: bass, songwriter (1982\u20131985)\n Zeo Giudici: drums (1982\u20131983)\n Mirka Morselli - drums (1983)\n Annarella Giudici (born Antonella Giudici): \"Benemerita soubrette\" vocals (1984\u20131990)\n Danilo Fatur: \"Artista del popolo\" (people's artist) vocals (1984\u20131990)\n Silvia Bonvicini: vocals (1984\u20131985)\n Carlo Chiapparini: guitar (1986\u20131989)\n Ignazio Orlando: bass, keyboards, drums (1986\u20131989)\n Gianni Maroccolo (Manciano, 9 May 1960): bass (1989\u20131990)\n Francesco Magnelli: keyboards (1989\u20131990) \n Ringo De Palma (born Luca De Benedictis, Turin, 28 December 1963 \u2013 Florence, 1 June 1990): drums (1989\u20131990)\n Giorgio Canali (1958): guitar, programming (1989\u20131990)\n\nMembers timeline\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n 1964/1985 Affinit\u00e0-Divergenze fra il Compagno Togliatti e Noi - Del Conseguimento della Maggiore Et\u00e0, Attack Punk Records, red vinyl 1986, re-released in 1988 by Virgin\n Socialismo e Barbarie, Virgin Records 1987, re-released in 1988 on CD with two extra tracks.\n Canzoni, Preghiere, Danze del II Millennio - Sezione Europa, Virgin, 1989\n Epica Etica Etnica Pathos, Virgin, 1990\n\nLive albums\n Live in Punkow, Virgin, 1996\n\nCompilation albums\n Compagni, cittadini, fratelli, partigiani / Ortodossia II, Virgin, 1988\n Ecco i miei gioielli, Virgin, 1992\n Enjoy CCCP, Virgin, 1994\n Essential (CCCP), EMI, 2012\n\nSingles\n Oh!

The new constitution was approved by voters and general elections were subsequently held on 15 May, before independence was declared on 8 June.\n\nBackground\nThe Maryland State Colonization Society was established in Maryland in the United States in 1830. The group established the Maryland Colony in Africa on 22 February 1834. After Liberia declared independence in 1847, the desire for independence also grew in Maryland, and the settlers presented a petition to the authorities for a referendum, which was held in January 1853 and approved by 100% of voters.\n\nIn February 1854 elections for a Constitutional Council were held. The Council subsequently produced a constitution making the territory a presidential republic with a bicameral legislature. The House of Representatives would have five members serving two year terms and the Senate four members serving four year terms. The presidential term would be two years. Elections would be held under universal suffrage for \"colored\" men, and only Maryland citizens would be able to own property.\n\nReferences\n\n1854 referendums\nReferendums in the Republic of Maryland\n1854 in Africa\nConstitutional referendums", "Margaret Barrington (10 May 1896 \u2013 8 March 1982) was an Irish writer and journalist.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nMargaret Barrington was born in Malin, County Donegal on 10 May 1896. Her parents were Richard Barrington, RIC sergeant, and Charlotte Barrington (n\u00e9e Scott), one of their three daughters. She spent much of her childhood living with her maternal grandfather due to her mother's poor health. She later moved to Dungannon, County Tyrone with her parents. She attended the Royal School, Dungannon, then Alexandra College, Dublin, and then in Normandy. She went on to enter Trinity College Dublin (TCD), graduating with a BA in modern literature with a gold medal in 1918. In 1922 she married the historian Edmund Curtis. Following this she taught German and French at a number of Dublin schools.\n\nWriting career\n\nBarrington's first published work was an article on the treatment of women students in TCD's College Miscellany of 5 June 1918. As she continued to publish, she regularly attended George William Russell's gatherings, meeting such figures as W. B. Yeats and James Stephens. Liam O'Flaherty described her as \"the little marvel of the literary circle here\" after he was introduced to her in early 1924. It appears that she and O'Flaherty began an affair soon after, resulting in Barrington leaving her husband by July 1924 and living with O'Flaherty in England. In August 1924, she contributed a short story entitled Colour to Francis Stuart's journal To-morrow, which tackled sexual and racial taboos.\n\nUpon her return to Ireland with O'Flaherty in December 1924, they received a cold reception from their old friends, suffering financially for a time. Once Barrington divorced Curtis, she married O'Flaherty in London in March 1926. Their only child, Pegeen, was born there soon after. O'Flaherty actively encouraged her to write during this time, but for the eight years they were married Barrington wrote very little. She blamed this lack of writing on the \"difficulties\" of married life. Their marriage was failing by the late 1920s, with, for example, Barrington having to write to their friend, A. D. Peters, to enquire if he knew where O'Flaherty was. In 1932 they separated and Barrington settled in London. The following years were the most productive of her life, when she translated, wrote, organised support of republicans in the Spanish Civil War, and assisted refugees from Nazi Germany. She was a supporter of the British Labour Party, taking on the women's column of the left-wing paper Tribune in November 1938.\n\nUpon the outbreak of World War II, Barrington returned to Ireland, living in Leap, County Cork with friends Ewart Milne and Stella Jackson. From 1941 to 1952 she was a regular contributor to The Bell with letters, reviews, essays and short stories. She lived in Castletownsend from 1947 to 1953, then settled in Kinsale.\n\nLater life and legacy\nThe later years of Barrington's life were lived in relative obscurity. She died in a Kinsale nursing home on 8 March 1982, and is buried locally. David's daughter Tamar, a collection of her short stories was published posthumously in 1982. At least three of her novels remain unpublished. Her short story, Village Without Men, from 1982 was included in the anthology The Glass Shore: Short Stories by Women Writers from the North of Ireland.\n\nReferences\n\n1896 births\n1982 deaths\nPeople from County Donegal\n20th-century Irish writers\n20th-century Irish women writers", "Franck Dannique Elemba Owaka (born 21 July 1990) is an athlete from the Republic of the Congo competing in the shot put.

Two of his partners also became infected with HIV.  One of the two had a child from the union with Monge and the child also contracted HIV. (He was also convicted of one count of unlawfully causing bodily harm to the baby by having unprotected sex with her mother.)\n\nSexual relationships\nMonge contracted HIV from his late wife, who died of AIDS complications in November 1999.  She contracted the virus from a blood transfusion in Nicaragua in 1981.  He learned he was HIV positive in November 1999, shortly before his wife died.\n\nMonge commenced his first sexual relationship in January 2000, in spite of a doctor warning him about the risks and advised him to reveal his being HIV positive to potential partners and to use a condom as the protection.\n\nMonge explained that he did not inform his sexual partners because he did not have time and because several of the women were too immature to handle the problem.  The sentencing judge called the explanations \"pathetic\".\n\nAccording to the evidence presented in court, Monge had the following overlapping unprotected sexual relationships with women:\n Victim #1:  January 1, 2000 - June 30, 2000.  She tested negative for HIV.\n Victim #2:  June 1, 2000 - May 30, 2001.  She is now HIV positive.  She became pregnant and her baby contracted HIV.\n Victim #3:  January 1, 2001 - June 30, 2001.  Victim #3 was a teenager.  She tested negative for HIV, but developed a sexually transmitted disease.\n Victim #4:  February 1, 2001 - April 30, 2001.  Met Monge at church.  Tested HIV positive in September 2001.\n\nIn the case of Victim #2, who became pregnant from Monge, he did not tell her he was HIV positive during their relationship and did not tell her after learning she was pregnant.  This prevented the mother from taking medication that might have reduced the risk of transmission of the virus to her baby girl during pregnancy.  She also practised breastfeeding, perhaps unknowingly passing the virus to the baby girl that way.\n\nAccording to the evidence presented in court, when one victim broke up with him Monge told her \"I gave you a present that no other guy can give you. I gave you AIDS\".\n\nMonge knew he was HIV positive and took precautions to protect his four children, for example wearing latex gloves when he cooked and letting another sibling shower his youngest daughter.\n\nSoon to be released from prison (Frontenac Institution), Monge has met a woman at a church he goes to on Sunday. They plan to be married once Monge is released and to reside in Nicaragua. The Correctional Service of Canada has denied his request for marriage.\n\nSentence\nOn June 27, 2002, Justice Steve Glithero of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice sentenced Monge to ten years in prison.\n\nThe judge said:\n\"This is a man who carried on four sexual affairs of significant length involving frequent sex.... He knowingly and repeatedly risked the very lives of four women and a child by his callous actions which persisted over months. He's largely responsible for the ruination of three lives. The effect of his actions is tragic and immense.... His actions show a callous and cruel disregard for his own flesh and blood.... One must ask why he would date women as prospective wives and mothers, yet knowingly expose them to the risk of infection with the same condition that had resulted in the death of his wife. ... None of these were one-night stands.\"\n\nSources\n \"Man gets 10 years in K-W HIV case,\" Kitchener Waterloo Record, p.

The technique as applied to a group of TV satellites from a single operator was pioneered by SES with the Astra satellites at 19.2\u00b0E.\n\nSatellite separation\nCommunications satellites' orbital positions are normally spaced apart along the geostationary orbit to provide for frequency reuse for both uplink and downlink transmissions. By separating adjacent satellites by a distance greater than the at-orbit beamwidth of the uplink antennas, the same carrier frequencies can be used to uplink to both satellites without interference. Similarly, a sufficient separation so that the beamwidth of the receiving dishes on the ground can distinguish one satellite from its neighbours, allows the same frequency spectrum to be used for adjacent satellite downlinks.\n\nCommunications satellites are positioned in orbital 'slots' allocated under the international treaty by ITU and separation between slots of 2\u00b0 or 3\u00b0 of orbital longitude is common.\n\nHistory of co-location\nCo-location of two satellites has long been used on a temporary basis for the transfer of services from a retiring satellite to a replacement satellite, and for the pairing of two partially malfunctioning satellites to operate as a single satellite. The planned co-location of two satellites was used by the TDF-1 and TDF-2 and TV-Sat 1 and TV-Sat 2 DBS satellites launched 1987-1990 to provide national DBS broadcasting to France and Germany.\n\nThe first co-location of a group of satellites (reaching eight in number) was by SES with the Astra satellites at 19.2\u00b0E. Astra 1A was launched in 1988 and followed by Astra 1B (1991), Astra 1C (1993), Astra 1D (1994), Astra 1E (1995), Astra 1F (1996), Astra 1G (1997), Astra 1H (1999), all co-located at the same orbital slot of 19.2\u00b0E (although Astra 1D was only co-located with all the other satellites at this position for short periods).\n\nCo-location is now employed at orbital slots across the geostationary orbit by many satellite operators, and is used by SES for multiple satellites at two of its Astra slots, 19.2\u00b0E and 28.2\u00b0E.\n\nBenefits of co-location\nThe greatest benefit of co-locating satellites at one orbital slot is that the capacity for traffic at that orbital position can be built-up in commercially manageable stages as demand dictates. In this way, when SES first brought DTH satellite TV to Europe it was not known what the demand for the services would be and therefore how many transponders would be required. The first satellite, Astra 1A, had just 16 transponders (for 16 analogue TV channels) and this capacity was doubled with the arrival of Astra 1B without any requirement for changes to viewers' equipment.\n\nSimilarly, the use of multiple co-located satellites at more than one orbital position allows for an operator to vary the capacity allocation at each position by moving individual satellites between positions in orbit to reduce or increase the capacity at each position without the delays and costs associated with launching additional satellites.\n\nAnother key benefit of co-location as exercised by SES is that of reliability of service, and it is a crucial defence against satellite failure. In the group of co-located Astra satellites at 19.2\u00b0E, each craft has additional backup capacity to be used in the case of a partial or complete failure onboard another satellite in the cluster. In the event of a problem, spare transponders on one or more of the co-located craft can be switched in to take over, without interruption of the transmissions.\n\nHow it works\nCo-located satellites cannot actually be positioned at the same point on the geostationary satellite arc. In fact, they are just close enough together to appear to be at the same position so far as the beamwidth of the receiving dish is concerned. SES maintains its co-located satellites within an imaginary 150\u00a0km cube in space, centred on the notional orbital position.\n\nAll geostationary satellites are influenced by gravity of the Earth, the Moon and the Sun, and tend to drift from their initial orbital position. They are maintained on-station with on-board thrusters fired under the control of the operations centre on the ground. With a group of co-located satellites, the task is complex as each satellite must be maintained within the 150\u00a0km box but kept at a suitable distance (typically over 5\u00a0km) from the other satellites in the group to avoid collision or mutual interference, at the same time expending the least possible fuel to prolong the life of the satellite.\n\nSee also\n Geostationary Orbit\n Communications satellite\nSES S.A.\nAstra (satellite)\nHigh Above (book)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n OnAstra - Official consumers/viewers' site\n SES - Official trade/industry site\n SES fleet information and map\n\nSatellites\nSatellite broadcasting", "St. Joseph's Minor Basilica Church is a Roman Catholic Church building in Elmina, in the Central Region of Ghana.

McIntyre (APA-129) was a Haskell-class attack transport in service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. She was scrapped in 1973.\n\nHistory\nMarvin H. McIntyre was of the VC2-S-AP5 Victory ship design type. Originally designated Arlington for Arlington County, Virginia, she was renamed in memorial to Marvin H. McIntyre, Secretary to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who died in office in 1943, becoming the only Haskell-class ship not named for a U.S. County. She was built under Maritime Commission contract (M.C.V. hull No. 45), was launched by the California Shipbuilding Corp., Wilmington, California, 21 September 1944; sponsored by Mrs. F. H. Warren, daughter of McIntyre; acquired by the Navy on loan charter 27 November 1944; and commissioned 28 November 1944.\n\nAfter shakedown, Marvin H. McIntyre stood out of Los Angeles Harbor, 18 January 1945, on her first war mission. She arrived at her destination, Lunga Point, Guadalcanal, 4 February and commenced intensive amphibious training operations in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa. Departing the Solomons 15 March, McIntyre steamed in convoy for the advanced staging area at Ulithi. There she rendezvoused with her task unit and sailed for the Ryukyus 27 March. At Okinawa on 1 April, she discharged passengers and cargo for the initial attack. The attack transport remained off Okinawa until 5 April, when she retired to the Marianas with wounded marines as passengers. She arrived at Saipan on the 9th, debarked the casualties, and got underway against the next day for Pearl Harbor.\n\nMcIntyre reached Pearl Harbor 19 April, remaining for 2 weeks before continuing on to San Francisco. At San Francisco she embarked Army Air Corps men and equipment for passage to the Philippines and sailed on 18 May. She entered Manila Bay 14 June, debarked the troops, and then steamed for Leyte, discharging cargo at Tacloban on the 19th. The ship then headed for New Guinea. Arriving Milne Bay, 30 June, she embarked medical supplies and a hospital detachment and got underway for Manila. Next ordered to Ulithi, the transport took on veteran Army Air Corps troops for return to the United States. McIntyre entered the harbor at San Pedro, California, 2 August.\n\nThe cessation of hostilities brought no immediate change in McIntyre\u2019s operations. Proceeding to Guam 21 August, she continued to transport troops and cargo to and among the islands of the western and central Pacific for the next 2 months. On 30 October, she reported, at Nagasaki, for \u201cMagic Carpet\u201d duty, returning men to the United States, arriving Seattle 21 November. The following month she returned to the western Pacific, arriving at Samar, Philippine Islands, 10 January 1946. She remained in Philippine waters until mid\u2011February. On 11 February, she departed Manila, called at Subic to embark passengers and then proceeded on to the west coast. Arriving San Francisco, 3 March, she debarked her passengers and prepared to get underway for Norfolk, Virginia.\n\nMcIntyre entered Hampton Roads 13 April, decommissioned there 6 June 1946, and returned to the Maritime Commission on the 12th. Her name was struck from the Navy list on the 19th.\n\nFate\nMarvin H. McIntyre entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet at James River, Virginia, on 12 June 1946. In 1955 McIntyre was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet as part of a Repair Program, GAA-So. Atl. SS Co., and then returned.  On 9 April 1973 she was sold to Union Minerals and Alloys Corporation, for $111,560, to be scrapped.  At 1235 EDT, on 24 July 1973 she was withdrawn from the Reserve Fleet and sent to the breaker's yard.\n\nAll that remains of McIntyre is her brass builder's plate.\n\nAwards\nMarvin H.

Nicknamed \"The Wild Child\" for his daring driving style, he is most famous for driving winged sprint cars with the World of Outlaws.\n\nEarly life\nJac was born in Wooster, Ohio in 1958. He grew up watching his father John (and later his brother Ed) race modifieds and sprint cars.\n\nRacing career\nHaudenschild has accumulated over 300 wins in more than 40 years behind the wheel, including 72 with the World of Outlaws (11th all-time in that series) and six with the USAC Sprint Car series. His best points finish with the World of Outlaws was 2nd in 1995, finishing only 142 points behind Dave Blaney. He is one of only four drivers to have won both World of Outlaws and USAC races at Eldora Speedway.\n\n1970s\nHe began racing sprint cars at the age of 15 in 1974 at tracks near his hometown of Wooster, Ohio. His first sprint car win came in his sophomore season in 1975 at Lakeville Speedway.\n\n1980s\nHis first ever non-wing sprint car win came in 1981 at Lawrenceburg Speedway, driving for car owner Bob Hampshire. That same year, Haudenschild won the Grand Annual Sprintcar Classic, the largest sprint car race in Australia.\n\nIn 1982, Haudenschild won 30 A-main features with Bob Hampshire, and got his first opportunity to drive for a major, sponsored team in the Gambler house car owned by C. K. Spurlock and sponsored by Kenny Rogers. He went on to repeat as winner of the Grand Annual Sprintcar Classic that year.\n\nHaudenschild nabbed his first major win in the United States in 1987 at the Kings Royal at Eldora Speedway.\n\n1990s\n\nHaudenschild spent much of the '90s driving for car owner Jack Elden, with whom he would achieve some of his biggest wins. In 1993, he joined Elden to drive the famous Pennzoil #22. That year, Haudenschild captured the inaugural $100,000-to-win Historical Big One race at Eldora Speedway. He would go on to win the Kings Royal two more times in the Elden #22 in 1994 and 1998, and followed that up with Gold Cup wins at Silver Dollar Speedway in 1998 and 1999, as well as the $50,000-to-win Front Row Challenge as Oskaloosa Speedway in 1999.\n\n2000s\nHaudenschild's richest win came in 2003 at the Mopar Million at Eldora Speedway. Driving for car owner Larry Woodward, Haudenschild beat 138 other non-wing sprint car drivers to take the $200,000-to-win payout. The race featured a million dollar purse and included ten heats and six features, beginning with an F-main.\n\n2008 brought a third $50,000 Gold Cup win in a season where Haudenschild claimed his 50th World of Outlaws win as well as his first win in Canada at Castrol Raceway.\n\nSince 2008, Haudenschild has driven for a number of car owners including Lon Carnahan, Dennis Roth, Paul Silva, Jamie Miller, Pete Grove, Gus Wasson, Richard Hoffman, and Tom and Sherry Leidig.\n\nAwards & Accomplishments\nNational Sprint Car Hall of Fame, 2009 inductee\nKings Royal: 1987, 1994, 1998\nGrand Annual Sprintcar Classic: 1981, 1982\nHistorical Big One: 1993\nGold Cup Race of Champions: 1998, 1999, 2008\nMopar Million: 2003\n\nPersonal life\nJac Haudenschild married Patty Sweeney, daughter of Max Sweeney, step-daughter of Bob Hogle, and granddaughter of Tommy Driscoll, in 1992.

The Igbos, who some pundits believe remain widely resented in Nigeria due to their prominent role in the Nigerian Civil War, have only held the presidency for six months since the country's independence. Despite the seeming political pendulum in Nigeria, according to which the presidency is swapped between the members of different regions on an alternating basis, Dr. Kalu has stated that the Igbos remain a political non-entity and third-class citizens who have not been provided the opportunity to hold the country's leading political office.\n\nThe Njiko Igbo Movement has garnered immense support among Igbos and the wider Nigerian community domestically and abroad, and today boasts branches and support groups throughout the diaspora.\n\nFormer Nigerian Senator, international lawyer, and human rights activist Emmanuel Onwe is a founding and executive member of the Njiko Igbo Movement.\n\nReferences \n\nIgbo society", "Adam Ross (born February 15, 1967) is an American writer and editor best known for his 2010 novel Mr. Peanut.\n\nBiography \nRoss was born and raised in New York City. As a child actor, he appeared in the 1979 film The Seduction of Joe Tynan, as well as numerous television shows, commercials, and radio dramas. Ross attended the Trinity School, where he was a state champion wrestler. His early literary fixations included Frank Herbert's Dune and the comic books of John Byrne, Frank Miller, and Walt Simonson, which he loved \"with such a passion that I read them into a state of frayed worthlessness.\"\n\nAfter graduating from Vassar College in 1989, he received a Master of Arts at Hollins University and earned a 1994 Master of Fine Arts in creative writing at Washington University in St. Louis, where he was taught by Stanley Elkin and William H. Gass. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Ross worked as a feature writer and reviewer for the alternative weekly Nashville Scene. He received a two-book deal from Alfred A. Knopf in 2007; his debut novel, Mr. Peanut, which Ross had been writing \"on and off for 15 years,\" was published in 2010. A Hitchcockian true crime story about a video game designer whose wife is found dead with peanuts lodged in her throat, the novel is structured like a M\u00f6bius strip, forcing the reader to ascertain which events are real and which are guilty projections of its characters. Mr. Peanut was described by Michiko Kakutani in The New York Times as \"a dark, dazzling and deeply flawed novel that announces the debut of an enormously talented writer,\" and was later named one of the best books of the year by The New Yorker, The Philadelphia Inquirer, The New Republic, and The Economist. It has been translated into 16 languages.\n\nRoss's collection of short stories, Ladies and Gentlemen, was featured in Kirkus Reviews''' list of the best books of 2011. His nonfiction has appeared in The New York Times Book Review, The Daily Beast, and The Wall Street Journal. His forthcoming novel Playworld is a semiautobiographical account of a year in the life of a child actor; Ross has said that \"the book\u2019s about the sometimes-fraught space that arises when adults and children find themselves consistently private.\"\n\nIn 2016, Ross was appointed editor of the historic literary journal The Sewanee Review. Subscriptions have risen under his tenure, and The New York Times has credited him with \"restor[ing] some of the journal's cultural cachet.\"\n\nRoss lives in Nashville, Tennessee with his wife and their two daughters.\n\n Bibliography \n Mr. Peanut (2010)\n Ladies and Gentlemen (2011)\n Playworld'' (forthcoming)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Official website\n\nLiving people\n1967 births\nAmerican male writers\n21st-century American novelists\nWashington University in St. Louis alumni\n21st-century American male writers\nVassar College alumni\nHollins University alumni", "Hindowa Batilo Momoh (born in Kailahun, Sierra Leone) is Sierra Leonean former radical youth activist and former President of the National Union of Sierra Leone Students.

It makes use of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), HTML5, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) standards. It is the successor to the earlier Protovis framework. Its development was noted in 2011, as version 2.0.0 was released in August 2011. With the release of version 4.0.0 in June 2016, D3 was changed from a single library into a collection of smaller, modular libraries that can be used independently.\n\nContext \nThere have been various previous attempts to bring data visualization to web browsers. The most notable examples were the Prefuse, Flare, and Protovis toolkits, which can all be considered as direct predecessors of D3.js.\n\nPrefuse was a visualization toolkit created in 2005 that required usage of Java, and visualizations were rendered within browsers with a Java plug-in. Flare was a similar toolkit from 2007 that used ActionScript, and required a Flash plug-in for rendering.\n\nIn 2009, based on the experience of developing and utilizing Prefuse and Flare, Jeffrey Heer, Mike Bostock, and Vadim Ogievetsky of Stanford University's Stanford Visualization Group created Protovis, a JavaScript library to generate SVG graphics from data. The library was known to data visualization practitioners and academics.\n\nIn 2011, the development of Protovis was stopped to focus on a new project, D3.js. Informed by experiences with Protovis, Bostock, along with Heer and Ogievetsky, developed D3.js to provide a more expressive framework that, at the same time, focuses on web standards and provides improved performance.\n\nTechnical principles \nThe D3.js library uses pre-built functions to select elements, create SVG objects, style them, or add transitions, dynamic effects, or tooltips. These objects can also be styled using CSS. Large datasets can be bound to SVG objects using D3.js functions to generate text/graphic charts and diagrams. The data can be in various formats such as JSON, comma-separated values (CSV) or geoJSON, but, if required, JavaScript functions can be written to read other data formats.\n\nSelections \nThe central principle of D3.js design is to enable the programmer to first use a CSS-style selector to select a given set of Document Object Model (DOM) nodes, then use operators to manipulate them in a similar manner to jQuery. For example, one may select all HTML paragraph elements (represented by ), and then change their text color, e.g. to lavender:\n\n d3.selectAll(\"p\")                 // select all <p> elements\n   .style(\"color\", \"lavender\")     // set style \"color\" to value \"lavender\"\n   .attr(\"class\", \"squares\")       // set attribute \"class\" to value \"squares\"\n   .attr(\"x\", 50);                 // set attribute \"x\" (horizontal position) to value 50px\n\nThe selection can be based on an HTML tag, class, identifier, attribute, or place in the hierarchy. Once elements are selected, one can apply operations to them. This includes getting and setting attributes, display texts, and styles (as in the above example). Elements may also be added and removed. This process of modifying, creating and removing HTML elements can be made dependent on data, which is the basic concept of D3.js.\n\nTransitions \nBy declaring a transition, values for attributes and styles can be smoothly interpolated over a certain time. The following code will make all HTML  elements on a page gradually change their text color to pink:\n\n d3.selectAll(\"p\")             // select all <p> elements\n   .transition(\"trans_1\")      // transition with name \"trans_1\"\n     .delay(0)                 // transition starting 0ms after trigger\n     .duration(500)            // transitioning for 500ms\n     .ease(d3.easeLinear)           // transition easing progression is linear...\n   .style(\"color\", \"pink\");    // ... to color:pink\n\nData-binding \nFor more advanced uses, loaded data drives the creation of elements. D3.js loads a given dataset, then, for each of its elements, creates an SVG object with associated properties (shape, colors, values) and behaviors (transitions, events).\n\n// Data\n  var countriesData = [\n     { name:\"Ireland\",  income:53000, life: 78, pop:6378, color: \"black\"},\n     { name:\"Norway\",   income:73000, life: 87, pop:5084, color: \"blue\" },\n     { name:\"Tanzania\", income:27000, life: 50, pop:3407, color: \"grey\" }\n  ];\n// Create SVG container\n  var svg = d3.select(\"#hook\").append(\"svg\")\n        .attr(\"width\", 120)\n        .attr(\"height\", 120)\n        .style(\"background-color\", \"#D0D0D0\");\n// Create SVG elements from data \n    svg.selectAll(\"circle\")                  // create virtual circle template\n      .data(countriesData)                   // bind data\n       .join(\"circle\")                                 // joins data to the selection and creates circle elements for each individual data\n        .attr(\"id\", function(d) { return d.name })            // set the circle's id according to the country name\n        .attr(\"cx\", function(d) { return d.income / 1000  })  // set the circle's horizontal position according to income \n        .attr(\"cy\", function(d) { return d.life })            // set the circle's vertical position according to life expectancy \n        .attr(\"r\",  function(d) { return d.pop / 1000 *2 })   // set the circle's radius according to country's population \n        .attr(\"fill\", function(d) { return d.color });        // set the circle's color according to country's color\n\nGenerated SVG graphics are designed according to the provided data.\n\nAppending nodes using data \nOnce a dataset is bound to a document, use of D3.js typically follows a pattern wherein an explicit .enter() function, an implicit \"update,\" and an explicit .exit() function is invoked for each item in the bound dataset. Any methods chained after the .enter() command will be called for each item in the dataset not already represented by a DOM node in the selection (the previous selectAll()). Likewise, the implicit update function is called on all existing selected nodes for which there is a corresponding item in the dataset, and .exit() is called on all existing selected nodes that do not have an item in the dataset to bind to them. The D3.js documentation provides several examples of how this works.\n\nAPI structure \nGiven the wide array of visualizations and utilities supported by D3.js, the library is split into multiple GitHub repositories, each containing many functions related to a certain area. These areas include:\n\n Visualization creation\n Axis creation (d3-axis)\n Chord diagrams (d3-chord)\n Contour creation (d3-contour)\n Delaunay and Voronoi diagrams (d3-delaunay)\n Force-directed graphs (d3-force)\n Map creation (d3-geo)\n Hierarchy visualization (d3-hierarchy)\n Path/line creation (d3-path)\n Polygon creation (d3-polygon)\n Visual encoding of data in scales (d3-scale)\n Scales specifically for colors (d3-scale-chromatic)\n Shape generation (d3-shape)\n Interaction and Animation\n Brushing, for chart region selection (d3-brush)\n Element dragging (d3-drag)\n Transition easing (d3-ease)\n Visual transitions and animation (d3-transition)\n Zoom and Pan functionality (d3-zoom)\n Data and visualization utilities\n Array utilities (d3-array)\n Color utilities (d3-color)\n Data file parsing (d3-dsv)\n Data fetching (d3-fetch)\n String formatting (d3-format)\n Quadtree utilities (d3-quadtree)\n Random numbers and distributions (d3-random)\n DOM selection and manipulation (d3-selection)\n Time utilities (d3-time)\n Time formatting (d3-time-format)\n Timer creation (d3-timer)\n\nMaths \n Generation of pseudorandom numbers with normal, log-normal, Bates, and Irwin-Hall distributions.\n Transformations in 2D: translation, rotation, skew, and scaling.\n\nArrays \nD3.js array operations are built to complement existing array support in JavaScript (mutator methods: sort, reverse, splice, shift and unshift; accessor methods: concat, join, slice, indexOf and lastIndexOf; iteration methods: filter, every, forEach, map, some, reduce and reduceRight). D3.js extends this functionality with:\n Functions for finding minimum, maximum, extent, sum, mean, median, and quantile of an array.\n Functions for ordering, shuffling, permuting, merging, and bisecting arrays.\n Functions for nesting arrays.\n Functions for manipulating associative arrays.\n Support for map and set collections.\n\nGeometry \n Computing convex hull of a set of points.\n Computing Voronoi tesselation of a set of points.\n Support for point quadtree data structure.\n Support for basic operations on polygon.\n\nColor \n Support for RGB, HSL, HCL, and L*a*b* color representation.\n Brightening, darkening, and interpolation of colors.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading \n Background on D3.js itself\n \n\n Using D3.js - beginner level\n \n \n\n Using D3.js - intermediate level\n \n \n\n Others\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n Videos\n\nRelated Projects\n The Vega and Vega-Lite visualisation grammars are a declarative visualization specification built on parts of D3.js.\n\nSee also \n\n JavaScript framework\n JavaScript library\n\nExternal links\n\n \n D3.js Gallery\n Blocksplorer, search for blocks by methods used\n D3 \"reusable chart\" libraries:\n C3 https://c3js.org\n Plotly https://plot.ly/javascript\n bl.ock.org and blockbuilder.org: popular early gallery system.\n Observablehq.com : main D3js playground.\n\n \nVisualization software\nFree software programmed in JavaScript\nJavaScript libraries\nJavaScript visualization toolkits\nSoftware using the BSD license\nVisualization API", "Hertford ( ) is the county town of Hertfordshire, England, and is also a civil parish in the East Hertfordshire district of the county. The parish had a population of 26,783 at the 2011 census.\n\nThe town grew around a ford on the River Lea, near its confluences with the rivers Mimram, Beane, and Rib. The Lea is navigable from the Thames up to Hertford. Fortified settlements were established on each side of the ford at Hertford in 913AD. The county of Hertfordshire was established at a similar time, being named after and administered from Hertford. Hertford Castle was built shortly after the Norman Conquest in 1066 and remained a royal residence until the early seventeenth century.\n\nHertfordshire County Council and East Hertfordshire District Council both have their main offices in the town and are major local employers, as is McMullen's Brewery, which has been based in the town since 1827. The town is also popular with commuters, being only  north of central London and connected to it by two railway lines.\n\nToponymy\nThe earliest reference to the town appears in the Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written by Bede in 731\u00a0AD, which refers to .  is the Old English spelling of hart, meaning a fully mature stag; thus the meaning of the name is a ford where harts are found. The Domesday Book of 1086 gives a spelling of .\n\nHistory\n\nOne possible earlier mention of the town was in 672\u00a0AD: the first synod of a number of the bishops in England was held either in Hertford or at Hartford, Cambridgeshire. The synod was called by Theodore of Tarsus; decisions included the calculation of the date of Easter.\n\nThe Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 913AD, Edward the Elder ordered the construction of two burhs (earthwork fortifications) either side of the ford over the River Lea at Hertford as part of his campaign against the Danes.\n\nBy the time of the Domesday Book, Hertford had two churches, two markets and three mills. The Normans began work on Hertford Castle, and Hertford Priory was founded by Ralph de Limesy. King Henry II rebuilt the castle in stone, but in 1216, during the First Barons' War, it was besieged and captured after 25 days by Prince Louis of France. The castle was regularly visited by English royalty and in 1358, Queen Isabella, wife of Edward II, died there. The priory was dissolved in 1536 and subsequently demolished and in 1563, the Parliament of England met at the castle because of an outbreak of plague in London. Hertford grew and prospered as a market and county town; communication was improved by the construction of the Lea Navigation Canal in 1767 and the arrival of the railway in 1843. The Port Hill drill hall was completed in 1898 and Yeomanry House was brought into military use in 1910.\n\nGovernance\nHertford has three tiers of local government at parish (town), district, and county level: Hertford Town Council, East Hertfordshire District Council, and Hertfordshire County Council, all three of which are based in the town.\n\nHertford has been the county town of Hertfordshire since the county was founded in Saxon times. The town also gave its name to the hundred of Hertford. The town was initially governed by the king's reeves. By the thirteenth century, the reeves had been replaced by a bailiff, elected by the burgesses. Charters of 1554 and 1589 established a common council of eleven chief burgesses and a bailiff. Another charter of 1605 changed the bailiff's title to mayor. Under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, Hertford became a Municipal borough; the ratepayers elected twelve councillors, who chose four aldermen, with the aldermen and councillors together composing the council (also known as the corporation), which elected the mayor.\n\nThe Hertford poor law union was established in 1835, covering the town and surrounding rural parishes.\n\nHertford Corporation used part of the Shire Hall as a Town Hall until 1911, when it moved into the surviving gatehouse of Hertford Castle.\n\nUnder the Local Government Act 1972, Hertford Municipal Borough was abolished, merging with other districts to become part of the district of East Hertfordshire with effect from 1 April 1974. A successor parish was created covering the former borough of Hertford, with its parish council taking the name Hertford Town Council. The town council is based at the former offices of the borough corporation at Hertford Castle.\n\nThe headquarters of Hertfordshire County Council is at County Hall, built in 1939 to replace the Shire Hall. East Hertfordshire District Council's offices almost adjoin County Hall, being at Wallfields, which prior to 1974 had been the offices of Hertford Rural District Council.\n\nArms\nFrom at least 1634, Hertford Corporation used an escutcheon (shield) depicting a hart above water to indicate a ford. The borough council was granted the right to complement its arms with a badge in 1925, and supporters were added in 1937. The coat of arms is now used by Hertford Town Council.\n\nGeography\nHertford is at the confluence of four river valleys: the Rib, Beane and Mimram join the River Lea at Hertford to flow east and then south toward the Thames as the Lee Navigation, after Hertford Castle Weir. The shared valley of the Lea and the Beane is called Hartham Common and this provides a large park to one side of the town centre running towards Ware and lying below the ridge upon which Bengeo is situated.\n\nThe town centre still has its medieval layout with many timber-framed buildings hidden under later frontages, particularly in St Andrew Street. Hertford suffers from traffic problems despite the existence of the 1960s A414 bypass called Gascoyne Way which passes close to the town centre. Plans have long existed to connect the A10 with the A414, by-passing the town completely. Nevertheless, the town retains very much a country-town feel, despite lying only  north of Central London. This is aided by its proximity to larger towns such as Harlow, Bishop's Stortford and Stevenage where modern development has been focused.   \nSuburbs and estates\n Bengeo\n Foxholes Estate\n Horns Mill\n Pinehurst, Hertford\n Rush Green\n Sele Farm\n\nNearby Hertford\n Hertford Heath\n Hertingfordbury\n Waterford\n\nEconomy\n\nA fair amount of employment in the town is centred on County Hall (Hertfordshire County Council), Wallfields (East Hertfordshire District Council) and McMullens Brewery, one of a dwindling number of independent pre-1970 family brewers in the United Kingdom. Many residents commute to work in London.\n\nHertford differs from neighbouring towns as it lacks a modern shopping development (mall). However, it has most of the usual supermarkets. A Tesco store occupies part of the former Christ's Hospital Bluecoat Girls School, which closed down in 1985. Sainsbury's opened a new store on part of the McMullens Brewery site in June 2012. A Waitrose occupied a reasonably large store in the Bircherley Green Shopping area that closed on 12 September 2017. The local branch of Woolworths closed for good on 27 December 2008, after the collapse of that store chain. There are fewer of the usual chain shops found in most high streets and this makes Hertford stand out from other \"clone towns\". There are a high number of independent shops in the town, with a variety of boutiques and salons.\n\nSport and leisure\nHertford has a leisure centre and swimming pool, skatepark,  bowling green and tennis courts on Hartham Common.\n\nFootball \nThere is a Non-League football club Hertford Town F.C., which plays at Hertingfordbury Park. Hertford Town Youth FC, a FA Charter Standard Football Club, play at County Hall Playing Fields, situated next to the headquarters of Hertfordshire County Council at County Hall in Hertford. Other clubs surrounding the town include Bury Rangers, Hertford Heath Youth FC and Bengeo Tigers Football Club (an award-winning FA Charter Standard Community Football Club.)\n\nCricket\n\nHertford Cricket Club is an English amateur cricket club, located in Hertford, the county town of Hertfordshire. Cricket records for a Hertford club go back a far as 1825, however the club in its present form has been in existence since 1860. The club plays its matches at Balls park, Hertford. Currently the club runs five teams and all the teams play in the local league.\n\nPeople\n Frederick Scott Archer (1813 \u2013 1857), son of a Hertford butcher, was an early photographer best known for having invented the photographic collodion process\n  The band Deep Purple formed in Hertford in 1968.\n Alfred Russel Wallace who proposed a theory of natural selection at the same time as Charles Darwin lived in Hertford from ages five to thirteen and attended Hertford Grammar School.\n John Wilkes, the radical politician, was educated in Hertford.\n Sergeant Alfred Alexander Burt VC, soldier in the Hertfordshire Regiment who was born and lived in Hertford.

This went beyond the higher criticism of the T\u00fcbingen school which (with the exception of Bruno Bauer) held that a core of at least four epistles had been written by Paul of Tarsus in the 1st century.\n\nDutch Radical School\nThe Dutch school of radical criticism started in 1878 with a publication by Allard Pierson, who denied Pauline authorship of Galatians. He was fiercely attacked by his colleague Abraham Dirk Loman, but two years later, also Loman abandoned the historicity of Paul. Similarly, Willem Christiaan van Manen, who had written a doctoral thesis defending the authenticity of 1 Thessalonians, wrote in 1889 that he had come to the same conclusions as Loman. Also, the philosopher Gerardus Johannes Petrus Josephus Bolland was a part of the movement. With the death of Van Manen's student Gustaaf Adolf van den Bergh van Eysinga in 1957, the line of scholarship at Dutch universities came to an end.\n\nThe name \"Dutch Radicals\" was coined by Loman, in an 1887 article reviewing  Edwin Johnson (\"Antiqua Mater: A Study of Christian Origins\", 1887), saying that \"the author is a radical like we seldom meet among theologians and hardly ever among English theologians\". The RadikalKritik article on van Manen and the Dutch Radicals adds that \"Van Manen later spoke of the 'radical' or the 'Dutch' school (1902). The 'radical' scholars did not want to be impeded by church canons and wanted to be free in their research of the New Testament and of the history of early Christianity. This research led them to the conclusion that we do not have any authentic Pauline epistles.\"\n\nThe Dutch school also influenced Rudolf Steck in Switzerland, and Arthur Drews in Germany. However, the works of Adolf Harnack proved more influential, and radical criticism was eventually abandoned and is now a fringe position in current New Testament scholarship.\n\nAttempts to revive Radical criticism has been made by Robert M. Price, Darrell J. Doughty and Hermann Detering, who founded in 1994 the Journal of Higher Criticism. These attempts have largely been ignored by mainstream scholarship and have received strong criticism from Bart D. Ehrman, Maurice Casey and R. Joseph Hoffmann.\n\nReception\nMembers of the Radical Dutch School argued against the existence of Jesus, which caused controversy. Robert Van Voorst wrote that \"their arguments were stoutly attacked in the Netherlands, especially by other scholars, but largely ignored out it.\"\n\nKey proponents\n\nGerard Bolland\nHermann Detering\nGustaaf Adolf van den Bergh van Eysinga\nAbraham Dirk Loman\nWillem Christiaan van Manen\nAllard Pierson\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \nHermann Detering's Radikal Kritik site (in German, limited English pages available)\nArticle by Hermann Detering for Institute for Higher Critical Studies\n\nBiblical criticism\nChrist myth theory", "The high sheriff is the oldest secular office under the Crown and is appointed annually (in March) by the Crown.

The club was founded in 1856.  Undine was not initially listed as a founder of the Schuylkill Navy, but is now considered a founder because an Undine member, Mr. B. F. Van dyke, was elected to represent the club as secretary treasurer of the Navy from its birth in 1858. In 1860, Undine purchased Keystone Barge Club's (the 1st) boat and equipment, as Keystone had disposed of its boathouse.\n\nThe club's name is derived from the Legend of Undine, and the club has an upriver house for social functions named Castle Ringstetten, which is the name of the castle in the legend.  The boathouse and Castle Ringstetten were designed by renowned Victorian-era architect Frank Furness and exemplify his original ideas that laid the foundation for modern architecture.\n\nProminent members\nJen Klapper - 2009  US National Team member (Adaptive Mixed Four)\nMike Naughton 2009  US National Team Coaching Staff\nMeghan Sarbanis - 2009 US National Team member (Lightweight Women's Single Sculls) 2003 US National Team member (Lightweight Women's Pair)\nJoe Quaid - 2007 US National Team Coaching Staff\nSam Saylor - 2006 National Team member, 2007 US National Team member (Men's Lightweight Quadruple Sculls)\nJon D\u2019Alba - 2006 National Team member, 2007 US National Team member (Men's Lightweight Quadruple Sculls)\nCody Lowry - 2006 National Team member, 2007 US National Team member (Men's Lightweight Quadruple Sculls)\nDan Urevick-Ackelsberg - 2006 National Team member, 2007 US National Team member (Men's Lightweight Quadruple Sculls), 2010 National Team member\nAndrew Quinn  - 2009 US National Team member (Men's Lightweight Double Sculls) 2008 US National Team member (Men's Lightweight Quadruple Scull)\n Tim Young - 1996 Olympic Team member, Silver Medalist\n Michael Senf - 2015,Under 23 National Team member (Men's Lightweight Quadruple Sculls)\n Reid Cucci - 2015, 2016 Under 23 National Team member (Men's Lightweight Quadruple Sculls)\n\nPhoto gallery\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\n\n Undine Barge Club on wikimapia.org\n\nNational Register of Historic Places in Philadelphia\nNational Historic Landmarks in Pennsylvania\nBuildings and structures in Philadelphia\nFrank Furness buildings\nBoathouse Row\nSchuylkill Navy\nSports clubs established in 1856\n1856 establishments in Pennsylvania\nHistory of Philadelphia\nPhiladelphia Register of Historic Places\nHistoric district contributing properties in Pennsylvania\nBoathouses on the National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania", "Gorebridge is a railway station on the Borders Railway, which runs between  and .

PHS was made of an asphalt-impregnated jute which was rolled out over the compacted surface over a square mesh track (SMT) grid of wire joined in 3-inch squares.   Pierced Steel Planking was also used for parking areas, as well as for dispersal sites, when it was available.

The magazine and the current essay series take the stance that work has too central a position in western life and that work, consumption and pursuit of social status too often take precedence over happiness, liberty, and unstructured leisure. Simple living, creativity and Epicureanism are offered as solutions to the problems of overwork and overconsumption.\n\nHistory\nNew Escapologist was founded in 2007. Speaking at a public event together in 2009, Robert Wringham told Tom Hodgkinson that he started New Escapologist after reading Hodgkinson's book How to be Free alongside a biography of Houdini and Among the Bohemians: experiments in living by Virginia Nicholson.\n\nA pilot issue was printed in 2007, a first canonical issue in 2008, and a launch party was held at the Glasgow CCA in 2009.\n\nIn 2011, New Escapologist organized a zine fair in support of the student occupation of Heatherington House at the University of Glasgow. The same year saw the launch of a fifth issue at The Arches theatre and nightclub, and a sixth issue at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\nIn 2014, around the time of the magazine's tenth issue, a spin-off book written by Wringham was announced. Following a successful crowdfunding campaign, the book was published by Unbound on 28 January 2016 followed by a German edition published by Heyne Verlag later that same year.\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that the magazine would close after a decade but would continue online as a subscription essay series mediated by Patreon. The first of these essays went live in April 2017.\n\nProduction\nThe magazine's distinct typography, according to a colophon printed in the back of each issue, was achieved using Donald Knuth's TeX typesetting system with a layout based on an ancient Ge'ez liturgical text seen at the Matenadaran Manuscripts Museum in Armenia.\n\nThe magazine's logo, featured prominently in the masthead of early issues and at the magazine's website is the ISO standard \"running man\" symbol usually seen on exit signs.\n\nNotable contributors\n\n Alain de Botton, philosopher\n Luke Rhinehart, author of The Dice Man\n Ewan Morrison, author of Tales from the Mall\n Richard Herring, comedian\n Tom Hodgkinson, author and editor of The Idler\n Dave Thompson, comedian and tellytubby\n Joshua Glenn, author of The Wage Slave's Glossary\n Judith Levine, journalist and NWU founder\n Ian Macpherson, comedian\n Dickon Edwards, musician and diarist\n Jacob Lund Fisker, blogger\n Aisl\u00ednn Clarke, movie and theater director\n Graham Fulton, poet\n\n Landis Blair, illustrator and comic artist\n Seth, cartoonist and book designer\n Leo Babauta, blogger and author of Zen Habits\n Stanley Cohen, London School of Economics-based Sociologist\n Mr. Money Mustache, financial blogger\n Lord Whimsy, designer and dandy\n Caitlin Doughty, author and mortician\n David Cain, blogger\n Steven Rainey, BBC Radio Ulster DJ\n Ellie Harrison, artist and political activist \n Joseph Heath, University of Toronto philosopher and economics writer\n Laura Gonzalez, GSA lecturer and artist \n LD Beghtol, musician\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Jacob Lund Fisker (2010) Early Retirement Extreme: A philosophical and practical guide to financial independence,\n\nExternal links\n Official website\n\nBiannual magazines published in the United Kingdom\nLifestyle magazines published in the United Kingdom\nOnline magazines published in the United Kingdom\nCriticism of work\nDefunct magazines published in the United Kingdom\nLiterature critical of work and the work ethic\nMagazines established in 2007\nMagazines disestablished in 2017\nOnline magazines with defunct print editions\nSimple living\nWorks about labor", "Ang\u00e8le Van Laeken () (; born 3 December 1995) is a Belgian singer.

The artistic options at this high school helped develop her musical skills. She then enrolled in the Jazz Studio Antwerp for a jazz education before joining her father's band.\n\nCareer\n\n2018\u2013present: Career beginnings and Brol\n\nAng\u00e8le gave her first performances in caf\u00e9s around Brussels.

The album was released on 5 October 2018, the same day as her single duet with her brother, Rom\u00e9o Elvis. This album was successful and resulted in Ang\u00e8le invitation to perform on various French TV shows. The single, \"Tout oublier\", spent nine weeks at number 1 on the Ultratop charts, breaking the record for a Belgian artist formerly set by Stromae.\n\nIn 2019, Ang\u00e8le became one of the most sought for artists in France and Belgium and affirmed her feminism with the song \"Balance ton quoi\" in reference to the French #metoo movement, Balance ton porc.

She is inspired by many musical genres from French songs to electronic music and rap, which she disliked as a teenager. She became influenced by rap, particularly while performing with her brother Romeo Elvis and the rappers Caballero and JeanJass.\n\nPersonal life\nFrom 2017 to 2019, she dated French dancer and choreographer L\u00e9o Walk. She wrote the song \"Perdus\" which is about the end of their relationship, linked to her new notoriety.\n\nIn August 2020, Ang\u00e8le announced on Instagram that she was dating French comedian Marie Papillon, while coming out.

He was a half-brother of Hans Stormoen, an uncle of Kjell Stormoen and a granduncle of Even Stormoen. By education, Stormoen had the examen artium from 1890 as well as one year at the Norwegian Military Academy. From October 1900 to 1909 he was married to Inga Bj\u00f8rnson (1871\u20131952); they had the child Guri Stormoen who became an actress. In July 1909 Harald Stormoen married Alfhild Larsen (1883\u20131974).\n\nActing career\n\nAfter some years in the United States, where he made his acting debut, Stormoen returned to Norway in 1895 and worked at various theatres. His breakthrough was playing the character \"Seladon Andrisen\" in Hans Aanrud's comedy Storken at Harald Otto's Norske Teaterselskab, and he also played this character later at other theatres. In 1899 he was hired at the newly opened National Theatre. He worked here from 1899 to 1918, 1921 to 1928 and 1935 to 1937. At the National Theatre Stormoen played both comic and tragic characters, often portraying elder men. Among his roles was \"the captain\" in Strindberg's drama The Dance of Death. From 1928 to 1935 he worked at Det Nye Teater. He also starred in movies between 1925 and 1932.\n\nOrganisation work\nStormoen chaired the Norwegian Actors' Equity Association from 1913 to 1915, from 1921 to 1924 and again from 1925 to 1928. During his first period the association successfully started giving matin\u00e9es to increase its income. In his second period the association celebrated its 25th anniversary. During his third period there was a tough struggle with Trondjems Teater, which experienced a difficult economic period and treated its staff badly. He was nominated Honorary Member of the association at his 60th anniversary in 1932.\n\nHarald Stormoen was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav in 1932. He died in November 1937 in Oslo.\n\nReferences\n\n1872 births\n1937 deaths\nPeople from Nord-Odal\nNorwegian Military Academy alumni\nNorwegian male stage actors\nNorwegian male film actors\nNorwegian male silent film actors\n20th-century Norwegian male actors\nNorwegian Army personnel\nNorwegian expatriates in the United States", "Leon Ware (February 16, 1940 \u2013 February 23, 2017) was an American songwriter, producer, composer, and singer. Besides a solo career as a performer, Ware was best known for producing hits for other artists including Michael Jackson, Quincy Jones, Maxwell, Minnie Riperton and Marvin Gaye, co-producing the latter's album, I Want You.\n\nEarly life \nWare was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, United States. His mother was a minister and a pianist for their local Baptist church and his father worked for Ford Motor Co. on the assembly line. Ware was the youngest of ten siblings. He was blind for two years after he had an accident with a slingshot when he was five years old. Despite being only blind in the right eye, his left eye was covered as well. Ware said that, \"They [presumably his family] worried that if my left eye wasn\u2019t covered, it would be too strong if my right eye regained its vision.\" Subsequently, he was sent to the Michigan School for the Blind. In his teens, he was a member of a vocal group, the Romeos, with Lamont Dozier and Ty Hunter (later of the Originals).\n\nCareer\n\nEarly career \nWare worked at ABC Records as an arranger and songwriter before he joined Motown as a songwriter in 1967. He had co-written songs for the Isley Brothers, Martha & the Vandellas, and the Jackson 5 during his early years at Motown.\n\nEarly major songwriting success: 1971\u20131973 \nIn 1971, Ware collaborated with Ike & Tina Turner, co-writing six songs on their United Artists album, [['Nuff Said (Ike & Tina Turner album)|Nuff Said.]] The album reached the #21 on the Billboard R&B chart and also appeared on the Billboard 200. This led to a contract as a solo artist on United Artists where he released his self-titled debut album in 1972. Around this time, Ware began collaborating with Arthur \"T-Boy\" Ross, younger brother of Diana Ross. One of the songs they wrote together was \"I Wanna Be Where You Are,\" recorded by Michael Jackson for his 1972 album, Got To Be There. The single reached number-two on the R&B charts and peaked at #16 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1972. Ware wrote for numerous artists during this period including Donny Hathaway and The Miracles.\n\n Subsequent success: 1974\u20131976 \nIn 1974, Quincy Jones booked Ware as songwriter and performer for two songs on Jones' Body Heat album. The song \"If I Ever Lose This Heaven\" hit the R&B charts in September of that year and was covered by the Average White Band. Ware had worked with Minnie Riperton on Jones' album, and they collaborated again on Riperton's album, Adventures in Paradise, composing Riperton's R&B hit, \"Inside My Love,\" and the two collaborated yet again on Ware's second album, Musical Massage. Ware and Ross worked on demos for Ware's second album, this one to be issued on Motown and also for Ross to win a deal. One of the demo recordings, \"I Want You,\" was heard by Berry Gordy, who decided the song would be a good fit for Marvin Gaye. Gaye heard the other demos and decided to record much of it on what would be his next album, I Want You. Buoyed by the number-one title track, the album peaked at number-one on the R&B charts and it reached the Top Ten of the Billboard 200 and sold over a million copies.\n\n Recording, songwriting, producing, and later career: 1976\u20132010s \nHaving given away the material for his album, Ware began again on a solo effort for Motown's Gordy label. The result would become his second album, Musical Massage, released in September 1976. The album was a commercial failure due to poor promotion. However, it became a cult hit among soul music fans that were intrigued by Gaye's I Want You album and the songs from Ware himself. After his brief stint as a recording artist at Motown, Ware decided to focus on writing and producing for other artists, and he wouldn't release another album until 1979. He finally achieved chart success when he released his third album, Inside Is Love, via Fabulous Records in 1979. It reached the charts along with its single, \"What's Your Name,\" establishing him as a recording artist for the first time. After recording for Fabulous Records, Ware signed with Elektra Records, and he released his fourth album in 1981, titled Rockin' You Eternally, which spawned two R&B singles chart entries, \"Baby Don't Stop Me\" and the title song, but the album itself did not reach the charts. Elektra financed a follow-up, and Ware's fifth album, Leon Ware, was released in 1982.Leon Ware (1982). Leon Ware. Elektra Records. Retrieved 2023-01-15. Unfortunately for Ware, the label dropped him when the album failed to sell many copies. In 1987, he signed with Slingshot Records and released his sixth album, Undercover.\n\nSome of the artists that Ware had written and produced for in between and after those periods include Shadow, Teena Marie, Jeffrey Osborne, Loose Ends, James Ingram, Melissa Manchester, Krystol, Bobby Womack, and Lulu, co-writing the latter's European hit, \"Independence.\"\n\nIn the '90s, his earlier work became a heavy source of samples in hip-hop music. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic wrote, \"Such success didn't increase Ware's exposure as an artist, but it substantially increased his publishing income. At the same time, he was being discovered as a soul music progenitor, particularly in England, where the Expansion label began reissuing his solo albums.\" Ware then released his seventh album, Taste the Love, on his own Kitchen Records label in 1995 to help his cause. He also contributed to singer Maxwell's 1996 debut album Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite by co-writing \"Sumthin' Sumthin'.\" The album is considered one of the landmark albums of the neo-soul genre.\n\nThroughout the 2000s, Ware continued to release several albums, which are Candlelight (2001), Love's Drippin (2003), Deeper (2004), A Kiss in the Sand (2004), and Moon Ride (2008).\n\nIn the 2010s, Ware was featured in several projects by current artists, such as Cherry Bomb by Tyler, the Creator, Vibes by Theophilus London, and Love in Beats by Omar. In 2019, after two years of his death, a posthumous album, Rainbow Deux, was released.\n\nPersonal life \nWare was married four times. His second wife was Susaye Greene, whom he married in 1974 and would later divorce in the same year.

He rode in the Tour de France and Giro d'Italia. He is often described as one of the classiest riders that Britain has ever produced, but his career was hindered by being over raced in his early days, and by injury in his later days. He is one of the few English-speaking riders to have stood on the podium of the Flanders Classics Het Volk.\n\nOrigins \n\nGraham was born in Cheadle, just south of Manchester. As a youth he was on the books of Manchester United F.C. as a part of their youth program. Graham gave up football in favour of cycling. He took his first step towards becoming a professional cyclist in 1972, age 14 he joined the Abbotsford Park Road cycling club which then had a clubroom in Fallowfield, Manchester. During his first year of racing he had no success and was even lapped frequently during the circuit races. It was not until 1974 at 16 years of age he won his first race in Macclesfield. He was coached by Malcolm Firth, who, along with Harold \"H\" Nelson, developed a training routine based on heart rates and power training. In 1975, as a Junior, he gained three fourth places in national championships (pursuit, road race and 25-mile time-trial) \u2013 indeed, the 40\u00a0km/25-mile time trial was his first race over the distance for two years and covered the distance in a little over 57 minutes. As well as winning the divisional junior road title, he won the senior pursuit title against the established senior rider, Malcolm Fraser. In his last year as a junior he had 12 wins and also finished 22nd in the World Junior Road Race Championship. In 1976 he went to the Netherlands for five months: his best place was 2nd and he had a host of top six places.\n\nAmateur career\n\nIn 1977 he won the UK's first classic of the season \u2013 the GP of Essex. He then moved to Belgium, along with the Liverpool rider Nigel Hartle. He won at Anvaing. His form saw him selected for the Peace Race, his first international stage race. The season ended with him being selected to ride in the Etoile Des Espiors (Stars of the future) race in France. He raced against both amateurs and professional riders including Bernard Hinault, yet proved he could hold his own against anyone, finishing third in a stage. In 1978 he moved to France to ride for the notable amateur team ACBB (Athletic Club de Boulogne Billencourt), Europe's most successful sports club, following in the footsteps of his friend and training partner Paul Sherwen. He rode in about 65 races, winning 15 of them including the Grand Prix de Nations, Paris-\u00c9vreux and the GP de France. International selection included the five-day Sealink International: he won the prologue in his native Manchester. His success in France saw him win the season long Merlin Plage Palme d'Or as the top amateur in France, and this led to him being offered a professional contract with Peugeot.\n\nProfessional career\n\nGraham was one of four new signings among the twenty two riders in the Peugeot team of 1979 which included Bernard Th\u00e9venet and Hennie Kuiper. In his first Professional race the Grand Prix St Raphael, he finished in second place behind Roger Rogiers.  A few weeks later, on stage 4 of the Paris Nice he was a part of an elite breakaway which tore the race apart. His undoubted class, however, wasn't allowed to flourish as it might, as he was over-raced by his team. Over the coming seasons, his ability against the watch, in the mountains and as a rouleur won him the respect of the peloton.\n\nThroughout his professional career Graham competed in the majority of prestigious races from the Tour de France to Paris\u2013Roubaix. However a combination of his loyalty to the team and bad luck restricted his palmares, as he was often used as a domestique to assist French riders who were behind him overall on general classification. His biggest disappointment was during the 1981 Crit\u00e9rium International, he had dropped Bernard Hinault but on the penultimate descent was knocked off by a press motor cycle. His 1982 season started badly: a training crash caused by ice, whilst out in Cheshire, led to a broken femur and this impacted massively on the season ahead. However, in 1982 he still managed arguably his greatest performance finishing second in the Flanders Classics Het Volk. He caught and dropped the breakaway group that included Sean Kelly and Roger De Vlaeminck. However he did not manage to catch the eventual winner Alfons De Wolf, finishing 26 seconds behind. In 1985 he returned home to Britain, riding with John Herety in the British-based professional Ever Ready /Marlboro team. One year later, Graham moved to the British ANC-Halfords team, riding alongside Joey McLoughlin, Paul Watson and Malcolm Elliott. ANC-Halfords were managed by Phil Griffiths and became a surprise inclusion in the 1987 Tour de France. The team suffered from a shortage of funding, and riders not knowing how to work as a team in a major Tour: as the grandee of the team, Graham tried to bring a professional approach to both the management and the riders Unfortunately, Graham was too exhausted to finish his final Tour. He then had a few rides the following season for Emmelle-MBK riding alongside Mark Bell. However his full-time career as a professional rider effectively ended with ANC-Halfords.\n\nPost-cycling career\n\nSince his retirement from the peloton, Graham has worked for a bike company (Emmelle) and still works as a commentator for the BBC, Eurosport and ITV. He's a regular on the Tour de France, and gets to meet up with the former riders of the peloton, notably Jean-Ren\u00e9 Bernaudeau, his former teammate and good friend.\n\nMajor results\n\n1976\n 5th Criterium des Vainqueurs\n1977\n1st GP of Essex\n1st Mike Tyzack Memorial\n1st Circuit of Ashurst\n1st Tielt Criterium\n1st Anvaing criterium\n6th Scottish Milk Race\n38th World Road Race Championship\n40th Peace Race (6th on stage 9)\n1978\n1st Prologue Time Trial, Sealink International\n1st GP de Toulon\n1st Paris-Evreux\n1st Paris\u2013Troyes\n1st GP de St Maxime\n1st Paris-Vierzon\n1st GP de France\n1st GP de Nations\n1st Palme d'Or Merlin Plage\n2nd Tour de Haut Var\n2nd Paris \u2013 Ezy\n1979\n2nd GP St Raphael\n7th GP Pino Cerami\n18th Amstel Gold Race\n35th Fl\u00e8che Wallonne\n1980\n11th Giro di Lombardia\n26th Paris\u2013Tours\n38th Paris\u2013Brussels\n49th Tour de France\n1981\n2nd Tour du Mediterranean\n2nd Classique Saint-Sebastien\n 3rd British National Road Race Championships\n3rd Subida a Arrate (Spanish hill climb)\n5th Tour du Haut Var\n20th Tour de France\n25th Fl\u00e8che Wallonne\n28th Gent\u2013Wevelgem\n36th Milan\u2013San Remo\n53rd Amstel Gold Race\n1982\n1st Tour of Delyn\n1st Woolmark GP\n2nd Het Volk\n7th Tour du Mediterranean\n51st Gent\u2013Wevelgem\n53rd World Road Race Championships\n1983\n26th Giro d'Italia\n69th Tour de France\n1984\nDNF Tour de France\n1985\n2nd Hull\n2nd Milton Keynes\n1986\n10th Overall, Milk Race\n3rd Stage 2, Milk Race\n2nd Stage 5, Milk Race\n1987\nDNF Tour de France\n\nSources \nTony Lyons site\nThe Graham Jones Story \nTour de France stats\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n1957 births\nLiving people\nEnglish male cyclists\nPeople from Cheadle, Greater Manchester\nCycling announcers", "Friedrich Jacob Theodor Pflaum (17 July 1846 \u2013 28 July 1923) was an Australian politician who represented the South Australian House of Assembly multi-member seat of Murray from 1902 to 1915, representing the Australasian National League from 1905 to 1910 and the Liberal Union from 1910 to 1915.\n\nPflaum was a member of the Destitute Board and the board of enquiry which looked into the nurses' dispute at the Destitute Asylum and exonerated Nurse Dunstan.\n\nReferences\n\nMembers of the South Australian House of Assembly\n1846 births\n1923 deaths", "Jean Chaumont (born 16 June 1983) is a French jazz guitarist and composer.\n\nCareer \nChaumont started playing guitar at fourteen years old, after eight years of piano training.

It was written by English novelist Ian McEwan. Its story follows a young boy named Mark who, after the death of his mother, is sent to stay with his aunt and uncle while his father is away on business. While there he meets his cousin Henry, who shows signs of violent and evil behavior. It stars Macaulay Culkin, Elijah Wood, Wendy Crewson, David Morse, Daniel Hugh Kelly, and Jacqueline Brookes.\n\nThe film was produced by Joseph Ruben and Mary Ann Page and was released on September 24, 1993. It grossed $12.5 million during its opening weekend and $60.6 million worldwide, against a budget of $17 million. It received negative reviews from critics and has a 25% approval rating based on 28 votes on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nPlot \n\nTwelve-year-old Mark Evans has recently experienced the death of his mother, Janice. Before leaving on a business trip to Tokyo, Mark's father Jack transports him from Arizona to his Uncle Wallace and Aunt Susan's house in Maine, where he will stay during winter break. Mark is reintroduced after a decade to his extended family, including his cousins Connie and Henry. Mark and Henry get along initially and Henry seems to be nice and well-mannered. However, Henry displays an abnormal fascination with death, making Mark feel uneasy.\n\nHenry begins to display psychopathic behavior, which Mark is unable to address to Wallace and Susan due to Henry's threats. One of his violent actions is throwing a dummy off a bridge onto a highway, causing a massive vehicle pileup; he then plans to kill Connie. Afraid something might happen to her, Mark spends the night in her room. The next morning, Mark awakens to find Henry has taken Connie ice skating. At the pond, Henry purposely throws her towards thin ice, which collapses. Connie is rescued, but ends up in a coma.\n\nEven though Susan does not initially believe Mark, she becomes suspicious and interrupts Henry's attempt to suffocate Connie in her hospital bed. Susan then finds a rubber duck that Henry has hidden in his shed \u2014 it had once belonged to Henry's younger brother, Richard, and had been with him in the bathtub the night he drowned; the duck went missing after. When Susan confronts Henry, he coldly reminds her that the toy had belonged to him first. He then flips and kindly asks for the rubber duck back. After a violent tug-of-war, he takes the toy and throws it down the well.\n\nAs Susan and Mark grow closer, Henry insinuates that he will kill Susan rather than let Mark continue to develop a relationship with her. When a fight breaks out between the two boys, Wallace locks Mark in the den. Henry asks a suspicious Susan to go for a walk with him, while Mark escapes and chases after them. Susan confronts Henry, asking him if he killed Richard, to which Henry sarcastically replies, \"What if I did?\" Susan realizes that Mark was right about her son's true nature. She tells Henry that he needs help, but he refuses and flees.\n\nSusan gives chase and upon arriving at a cliff, Henry pushes her over the edge. As Susan dangles from a branch on the cliffside, Henry picks up a large rock to drop on her, but Mark tackles him. Susan manages to climb back up just in time to grab hold of the boys as they roll over the edge, one in each hand. Henry holds on with both hands but Mark's one-handed grip begins to slip. With only enough strength to save one of them, Susan reluctantly releases Henry and he falls to his death. Susan pulls Mark up and they look down as Henry's corpse is washed away into the ocean.\n\nWhen Mark returns home to Arizona, he reflects upon Susan's choice to save him instead of Henry. He wonders if she would make the same choice again, but knows it is something that he will never ask her.\n\nCast\n\nProduction \nFollowing the completion of his novel The Child in Time, English novelist Ian McEwan was invited by 20th Century Fox to write a screenplay \"about evil \u2013 possibly concerning children.\" McEwan recalled, \"The idea was to make a low budget, high class movie, not something that Fox would naturally make a lot of money on.\" Despite being well received, the end result was deemed insufficiently commercial by the parties that commissioned it and it floated around Hollywood until being discovered by independent producer Mary Ann Page. Enthusiastic about the script, which was originally sent to her as a writing sample, Page tried to get the project off the ground for three and a half years. The film was briefly set up at Universal Studios, during which Brian Gilbert was attached as director. In 1988, Michael Klesic was originally cast in the role of Henry Evans. The film was soon after put on hold due to a lack of funding.\n\nFollowing the successes of Home Alone and The Silence of the Lambs, which demonstrated the box-office appeal of a movie about kids and of an \"extreme thriller\" respectively, Fox itself chose to revisit the project, which they now saw as viable. Director Michael Lehmann (Heathers) became attached, Laurence Mark was appointed as a co-producer and McEwan was called in for rewrites. Mary Steenburgen was cast as Susan and Jesse Bradford had replaced Klesic as Henry because he had grown too old to play the part. McEwan was optimistic about the project and by November 1991, sets were being built in Maine for a production that would cost approximately $12 million. This progress was suddenly interrupted when Kit Culkin, Macaulay Culkin's father and manager, at the time a notoriously influential force in Hollywood due to the child's stardom, wanted his son to star in the film. Wishing to prove Macaulay's capacity in a dark role, he made his son's part in The Good Son a condition for his appearing in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. Fox agreed enthusiastically due to Culkin's bankability.\n\nAs the movie was originally scheduled to shoot at the same time as Home Alone 2, the start date for The Good Son was pushed back for a year, making Steenburgen no longer available and having her replaced by Wendy Crewson but also enabling Elijah Wood's involvement. Director Lehmann and producer Mark conflicted with the imposition, leading both to leave the project. The demanding Culkin would go on to insist that Macaulay's sister, Quinn, receive a role in the film and vetted replacement director Joseph Ruben (Sleeping with the Enemy). Furthermore, the budget had risen to an estimated $20 million. McEwan found himself performing further rewrites that continued to simplify the story to satisfy Ruben's comparatively mainstream tastes and was ultimately unceremoniously removed from the project altogether when another screenwriter, Ruben's frequent collaborator David Loughery, was commissioned. Despite this, McEwan was awarded sole writing credit in arbitration when he contested a shared credit.\n\nPrincipal photography took place between November 1992 and February 1993. Interiors of the Evans household were filmed in Beverly, Massachusetts, while exteriors were filmed in the Manchester-by-the-Sea village in Cape Ann and the communities of Rockport, Essex, Annisquam, Danvers, and Marblehead. The climactic cliff scene was filmed at Lake Superior\u2019s 120-foot cliff, Palisade Head.\n\nRelease \nThe Good Son was theatrically released on September 24, 1993. It was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1994. A DVD of the film was released on September 11, 2012. A Blu-ray release of The Good Son was announced on October 25, 2016 and was released on August 1, 2017.\n\nElmer Bernstein's score to The Good Son was released in 1993 by Fox Music. The score was orchestrated by Emilie A. Bernstein and Patrick Russ, and featured Cynthia Millar on ondes martenot.\n\nA tie-in novel was published alongside the movie's release in 1993, written by Todd Strasser. The novel elaborates on the movie, detailing how Henry was born a sociopath, rather than being some personification of evil. In the novel, Henry's mother Susan eventually discovers that Henry is unable to understand emotions like love and sorrow, and that pleasure derived from selfish actions and the torment of others are the few things he truly feels. The book also concludes differently from the movie, ending with Mark returning to Uncle Wallace's home in Maine one year later. Mark and Susan visit Henry's grave, which includes an epitaph: \"Without Darkness There Can Be No Light\".\n\nReception\n\nBox office \nThe Good Son earned US$44,789,789 at the North American box office revenues, and another $15,823,219 in other territories, for a total worldwide box office take of $60,613,008.\n\nCritics \nAs of August 2022, on Rotten Tomatoes, the film had an approval rating of 25% based on 28 reviews, with an average rating of 4.6/10. The site's consensus stated: \"The Good Son is never good enough to live up to its unsettling potential, failing to drum up much suspense and unable to make Macaulay Culkin a credible psychopath.\" As of December 2020, on Metacritic, the film had a weighted average score of 45 out of 100 based on 17 reviews, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale.\n\nRoger Ebert, who deemed the film inappropriate for children, awarded it half a star, calling the project a \"creepy, unpleasant experience\". He and Gene Siskel later gave it \"Two Thumbs Down\". Many critics criticized the casting of Culkin because of his comedic image from Home Alone. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post stated that \"the mere presence of the adorable boy star... seems to throw the whole film out of whack, making the picture play more like an inadvertent comedy than a thriller.\" Janet Maslin in The New York Times wrote that the end sequence at the cliff \"is one of its few suspenseful and original moments\" and \"is quite literally gripping.\"\n\nPaul Willinstein of The Morning Call described the film as \"Home Alone meets Misery meets The Hand That Rocks the Cradle.\"\n\nAccolades\n\nAnalysis \nJohn Kenneth Muir in Horror Films of the 1990s wrote that the main difference between this and The Bad Seed was that the mother character ends Henry's bad conduct, while in the latter the mother is unable to stop Rhoda Penmark.\n\nSee also \n The Other (1972 film)\n The Bad Seed\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n \n \n \n\n1993 films\n1993 drama films\n1990s American films\n1990s crime drama films\n1990s English-language films\n1990s exploitation films\n1990s psychological thriller films\n20th Century Fox films\nFilm controversies in the United Kingdom\nFilm censorship in the United Kingdom\nObscenity controversies in film\nFilm controversies\nCensored films\nAmerican psychological thriller films\nFilicide in fiction\nFilms about children\nFilms about cousins\nFilms about families\nFilms about juvenile delinquency\nFilms about mother\u2013son relationships\nFilms about stalking\nFilms directed by Joseph Ruben\nFilms scored by Elmer Bernstein\nFilms set in Arizona\nFilms set in Maine\nFilms shot in Maine\nFilms shot in Minnesota\nFilms shot in New Hampshire\nFilms shot in Massachusetts\nFilms shot in New Mexico\nFilms shot in the Las Vegas Valley\nFilms with screenplays by Ian McEwan\nFratricide in fiction\nMurder in films", "Carmen \u021aurlea (born 18 November 1975 Cisnadie) is a Romanian female volleyball player, who plays as an opposite.\n\nShe was part of the Romania women's national volleyball team at the 2002 FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship in Germany.

It was founded in 1813 as the Maine Literary and Theological Institution, then renamed Waterville College after the city where it resides. The donations of Christian philanthropist Gardner Colby saw the institution renamed again to Colby University before settling on its current title, reflecting its liberal arts college curriculum. Approximately 2,000 students from more than 60 countries are enrolled annually.  The college offers 54 major fields of study and 30 minors.\n\nLocated in central Maine, the 714-acre Neo-Georgian campus sits atop Mayflower Hill and overlooks downtown Waterville and the Kennebec River Valley. Along with fellow Maine institutions Bates College and Bowdoin College, Colby competes in the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC) and the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium. In addition to Bates and Bowdoin, Colby is among the most selective liberal arts colleges in the country, and is considered a Little Ivy.\n\nHistory\n\n19th century \nOn February 27, 1813, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, led by Baptists, adopted a petition to establish the Maine Literary and Theological Institution. It was moved to Waterville, Maine, and used 179 acres of land donated by citizens. In 1818, trustees assigned the institution to Rev. Jeremiah Chaplin and classes began in a vacant Waterville home. After Maine separated from Massachusetts in 1820, the first Maine legislature affirmed the Massachusetts charter for the institution, but made significant changes. Students could no longer be denied admission based on religion, the institution was prohibited from applying a religious test when selecting board members, and the trustees now had the authority to grant degrees. The Maine Literary and Theological Institution was renamed Waterville College on February 5, 1821, and four years later, the theological department was discontinued.  In 1828 the trustees decided to turn the somewhat informal preparatory department of the college into a separate school named Waterville Academy (most recently called the Coburn Classical Institute).\n\nIn 1833, Rev. Rufus Babcock became Colby's second president, and students formed the nation's first college-based anti-slavery society.  In 1845, the college's first Greek Society was formed, a chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon, which was followed by chapters of Zeta Psi in 1850 and Delta Upsilon in 1852.\n\nDuring the Civil War, many young men were called away from school to join the fight; from Waterville College, Richard C. Shannon, Henry C. Merriam, and Benjamin Butler. Twenty-seven Waterville College students perished in the war, and more than 100 men from the town.  In the years following the war, as was the case at many American colleges, Waterville College was left with few students remaining to pay the bills and a depleted endowment. The college was on the verge of closing.\n\nOn August 9, 1865, prominent Baptist philanthropist Gardner Colby attended Waterville College's commencement dinner, and unbeknownst to anyone in attendance except college president James Tift Champlin, announced a matching $50,000 donation to the college; two years later the college was named after him. Trustees of the college voted to construct a library and chapel to honor the Colby men who died in the war, called the Memorial Hall; it was dedicated at the commencement of 1869. The college remained isolated from neighboring Bates College, and Bowdoin College due to its location in Waterville, coupled with socio-economic and political differences. At the 1871 commencement, a Martin Milmore sculpture based on the Lion of Lucerne was added as the centerpiece of the building. In the fall of 1871, Colby University was the first all-male college in New England to accept female students.  The national Sigma Kappa sorority was founded at Colby in 1874 by the college's first five female students.  However the college resegregated them in 1890. One of the buildings is named after the first woman to attend, Mary Caffrey Low, who was the valedictorian of the Class of 1875. In 1874, based on the success of its partnership with the Coburn Classical Institute, Colby created relationships with Hebron Academy and Houlton Academy (most recently known as Ricker College).  In 1893, the Higgins Classical Institute was also deeded to Colby - the last preparatory school that the university would acquire.  Students published the first issue of The Colby Echo in 1877. On January 25, 1899, Colby president Nathaniel Butler Jr. '73, renamed the \"university\" Colby College.\n\nIn 1920, Colby celebrated its centennial, marking not the date of the original charter (1813), but the date of its charter from the new State of Maine in 1820.\n\n20th century \nFranklin W. Johnson was appointed president of the college in June 1929. That same year saw the public release of the Maine Higher Education Survey Report, which gave Colby's campus a less than desirable review.  Criticisms included a cramped location on just 28 acres located between the Kennebec River and the Maine Central Railroad Company tracks through Waterville, an aging physical plant, proximity to the unpleasant odors of a pulp mill, and the soot of the railroad.  Using the report as justification, President Johnson presented a proposal to the Trustees on June 14, 1929, to move the college to a more adequate location .  The campaign to raise funds for the move was immediately complicated by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the Great Depression, and competing offers for the college's contemplated location emerged.  Most notably, William H. Gannett offered a site in Augusta - a financially attractive option for the college, but a troublesome prospect for the town of Waterville.  Ultimately, a joint effort between Waterville citizens and the college raised more than $100,000 to purchase  near the outskirts of the city on Mayflower Hill, and the deed was presented to the college on April 12, 1931.\n\nMayflower Hill\nColby employs 216 instructional faculty members, approximately 90% of whom hold a doctorate or other terminal degree.\nIn 1937, according to master plans drawn up by Jens Fredrick Larson, construction broke ground on Lorimer Chapel, the first building on the new Mayflower Hill campus. In 1956, the Maine State Highway Commission diverted the proposed path of Interstate 95 to swing clear of the new campus to the west, and in 1961, Parade magazine called the 24-mile section of I-95 from Augusta to Waterville \"America's finest example of a 'driver's road' \" for scenery, speed, and safety. The college began competing athletically with Bowdoin and Bates in the 1940s, and officially joined the two colleges in the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium in 1965, after the University of Maine increased enrollment and moved to another athletic conference. The consortium became an athletic rivalry and academic exchange program.\n\n21st century \nWilliam D. Adams was the President of Colby from 2000 to 2014.  Major accomplishments included conducting the largest capital campaign in the history of Maine, which raised $376 million; a new strategic plan for the college; accepting a major gift for the Colby College Museum of Art- the Lunder Collection of American Art - and the construction of a new wing for the museum to house it in 2013; expansion onto the \"Colby Green\" with the construction of the Diamond Building in 2007 and the Davis Science Building in 2014.\nIn 2014, a documentary was created depicting a wide range of student experiences, including academic climate, social gatherings, athletics, and graduate outlooks, called Colby Life. On July 1, 2014, David A. Greene took office as the new president of the college.\n\nAcademics\n\nStudents choose from courses in 54 major fields and have flexibility in designing independent study programs, electing special majors, and participating in internships and study-abroad programs. Colby emphasizes project-based learning.  Colby's most popular majors, by 2021 graduates, were:\nEconometrics and Quantitative Economics (62)\nPolitical Science and Government (62)\nComputer Science (34)\nPsychology (32)\nEnvironmental Science (30)\nBiology/Biological Sciences (29)\nNeuroscience (29)\nVolunteer programs and service learning take many students into the surrounding community. Colby employs 216 instructional faculty members, approximately 90% whom hold a doctorate or other terminal degree.\n\nThe academic year follows a 4\u20131\u20134 with two four-course semesters plus a Winter Term session in January. The Winter Term, often called \"Jan-plan\", allows students to enroll in one intensive course, pursue independent research, or complete an off-campus internship.\n\nMore than two-thirds of Colby's students spend time studying off-campus before they graduate.  The college recognizes credits earned at over 200 off-campus programs in more than 60 countries.  Additionally, studies at four programs locations are recognized for inclusion in students calculated grade-point averages: The International Center for French Studies at the University of Burgundy in Dijon, France; the St. Petersburg Classical Gymnasium in Saint Petersburg, Russia; The University of Salamanca in Salamanca, Spain; and the Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences in Boothbay Harbor, Maine.\n\nColby also participates in engineering dual-degree programs with the Columbia School of Engineering and Applied Science at Columbia University, and the Thayer School of Engineering at Dartmouth College. The programs vary in length and requirements. The Dartmouth College program, which is on a 2\u20131\u20131\u20131 schedule, is the more popular one. \n\nFor the class of 2024, Colby College admitted 9% of applicants, accepting 1,307 out of 13,922 applicants. This represents a 13.5 percentage point decrease from the acceptance rate for the Class of 2019, which was 22.5%, due in part to the college's decision to waive certain admissions requirements, such as the supplemental essay, and by increasing financial aid commitments.\n\nRankings\n\nThe 2020 annual ranking of U.S. News & World Report rates it tied for the 11th best liberal arts college overall in the U.S., 16th for \"Best Value\", tied at 18th for \"Most Innovative\" and tied at 48th for \"Best Undergraduate Teaching\" among liberal arts colleges. Washington Monthly ranked the college 37th in 2019 among 214 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service. Forbes in 2019 rated Colby 75th overall in its America's Top Colleges ranking of 650 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges, and 32nd among liberal arts colleges.  Kiplinger's Personal Finance places Colby at 46th in its 2019 ranking of 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States. Colby College is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.\n\nIn 2016, Niche gave the college an \"A+\" for academics, administration, food, campus quality and diversity, a \"B\" for campus housing, health & safety, and athletics, and a \"C+\" for local city, and off-campus housing. In Niche's official rankings, the college placed 16th for liberal arts and 46th overall. Colby was ranked 29th in the country by Parchment. Colby was also named one of \"25 New Ivies\" by Newsweek, named to the list of the top ten environmental programs by the 2010 Fiske Guide, and ranked 13th by the 2011 Sierra Club rankings of \"America's coolest schools\".\n\nCampus\n\nColby's 714-acre campus is situated on Mayflower Hill overlooking Waterville, Maine, located along the Kennebec River Valley in Central Maine. Colby's campus buildings vary in age from the original Mayflower Hill construction in the 1930s to its newest building, Davis, completed in 2014. Most of Colby's buildings are designed in the Georgian Revival style of the original Mayflower Hill construction. The Goldfarb Center for Public Affairs and Civic Engagement organizes Colby's engagement in the local community.  The Goldfarb Center has assumed responsibility for organizing and awarding the Elijah Parish Lovejoy Award annually, established in 1952, the Morton A. Brody Distinguished Judicial Service Award, the William R. and Linda K. Cotter Debate Series, the Senator George J. Mitchell Distinguished International Lecture Series, and Colby's Visiting Fellows Program.  The center also organizes Colby's civic engagement programs, the Colby Volunteer Center and Colby Cares about Kids.  The college earned a top-25 listing on the Peace Corps' \"ranking of colleges that produce the most volunteers.\"\n\nColby is a residential college and almost all students live on campus. The dormitories vary in design and age; some are from the original Mayflower Hill construction, with the newest addition being the Alfond Senior Apartments. Room arrangements range from singles to quads and apartment suites.\n\nCotter Union is the center of student life and programming, and houses the Pulver Pavilion, Pugh Center for Multicultural Affairs, Page Commons auditorium, and the Student Post Office.  Mary Low contains the Colby Outing Club and the Mary Low Coffee House for student performances, Roberts Union houses student offices for the Colby Echo and the radio station WMHB.\n\nAll meals and catered events on campus are served by Colby Dining Services, operated by Sodexo until July 2016, which makes a concentrated effort to purchase foods from suppliers and producers within the state of Maine, like Oakhurst Dairy and others.  Dining-hall options include four establishments on Campus, plus the Marchese Blue Light Pub.\n\nBon App\u00e9tit Management Company currently operates Colby Dining Services\n\nLibraries\n\nColby's three libraries\u2014Miller Library, the Bixler Art and Music Library, and the Olin Science Library\u2014have a collection of more than 900,000 books, journals, microfilms, music scores, sound recordings, videos/DVDs, and manuscripts. They provide access to more than 100 electronic databases and more than 47,500 electronic journals. Computer labs, wireless networks, laptops, study areas, and a listening center are available for student use.\n\nColby College Museum of Art\n\nThe college's Museum of Art was founded in 1959 with the building of the Mayflower Hill Campus.  Admission is free to the museum, which serves both as a teaching resource for Colby College and as an active cultural institution for the residents of Maine and visitors to the state.  It is notable for an entire wing dedicated to works by American painter Alex Katz, a particularly strong collection of American art, and its major outdoor sculptures by Richard Serra and Sol LeWitt. The museum is part of the Bixler Art and Music Center, a building named in honor of President J. Seelye Bixler (1942\u20131960) in recognition of his visionary support for the arts at Colby.  The most recent addition to the museum was the Alfond-Lunder wing, opened in 2013 to display the recently donated Lunder Collection of American Art. The gallery space in the museum now exceeds 38,000 square feet, surpassing the Portland Museum of Art and making it the largest art museum in Maine.\n\nSustainability\nIn the fall of 2009, Colby launched Green Colby to highlight Colby's environmental policies (carbon footprint, conservation, student involvement etc.).  The school has signed a number of official agreements to reduce its environmental impact, including the Maine Governor's Carbon Challenge and the American College and University President's Climate Commitment (ACUPCC).  As of April 2013, Colby became the fourth institution of higher education to achieve campus carbon neutrality.\n\nAll of the school's electricity comes from renewable sources\u2014hydro and biomass\u2014with 10 percent of campus electricity provided by an on-campus cogeneration turbine.  The college has stated that all new buildings will comply with a minimum LEED silver standard, and renovated buildings will also include green features. The dining halls make an effort to purchase local and organic foods, and the elimination of trays has saved 79,000 gallons of water and 50 tons of food waste annually. Colby also has a composting program which processes more than 100 tons of food and yard waste annually. On the College Sustainability Report Card 2009 Colby earned a B; Colby's grade was brought down by its lack of endowment transparency and shareholder engagement.\n\nStudent life\n\nColby's 1,800-plus students, evenly divided between men and women, come from every state and more than 60 countries. Colby students are listed as 67.2% white, 10.2% unknown race, 24% of its students being ALANA (Asian, Latino, African American, etc.) and 7% being international.\n\nColby's was one of the five original schools to partner with the Shelby Davis Scholarship program for graduates from the United World Colleges, dramatically increasing the international student population.  Colby also participates in the Posse Foundation for multicultural scholars.\n\nThe college hosts myriad student-run organizations, ranging from student-run government to a cappella groups and more. The Student Government Association (SGA) advises and interacts with the college administration on issues ranging from policies and procedures to class presidents and dorm heads; it is also responsible for allocating funding to other student-run organizations.  The Student Programming Board is the student organization which plans speaking events, concerts, dances and other gatherings.\n\nOther student organizations range from a radio station and a newspaper to the Rugby team, Woodsman team, the Colby Outing Club, and more.\n\nAthletics\n\nThe Colby Mules compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III, the New England Small College Athletic Conference (NESCAC), and the Colby-Bates-Bowdoin Consortium.  The three schools compete vigorously in athletics, most notably in football and the Chase Regatta.\nThere are 16 varsity teams for women, 15 for men, and one co-ed team.  The official school colors are blue and gray.  Approximately 1/3 of the student population participates in one or more of 32 intercollegiate varsity sports.  Colby also offers club sports and an intramural sports program called I-Play.  As of 2013, five graduates have qualified for the Olympic Games. Colby holds nine national titles in the NESCAC.\n\nThe Harold Alfond Athletic Center is the center of athletic life at Colby, and home to the Colby Mules. It contains the Wadsworth Gymnasium, with a capacity of 2,600 people, the Alfond Rink with 1,750 seats, the Colby swimming pool, The Dunaway Squash Courts, the Boulos Family Fitness Center, and a field house with a four-lane, 220-yard track, and athletic offices.\n\nSurrounding the Harold Alfond Athletic Center are the Harold Alfond Stadium and track, two illuminated synthetic turf fields, the Alfond-Wales Tennis Courts, three full-size grass playing fields, a baseball diamond, a softball diamond, and the Perkins Arboretum with cross-country running trails.\n\nIn addition to the on-campus facilities, the Mules also utilize numerous off-campus facilities. The Colby-Hume Center for Colby's crew and sailing teams is located on Messalonskee Lake. Sugarloaf Ski Resort is home to the Alpine Ski Team, and is used extensively by recreational skiers from Colby because of its proximity to campus, about 50 miles away. The Waterville Country Club is home to Colby's golf program.\n\nControversies \nIn 1977, Colby and TIAA\u2013CREF successfully defended a lawsuit brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, alleging sex discrimination in payment of retirement benefits.  Of the case, President Strider commented that \"Colby is prepared, as we have always tried to do, to comply with the law, but it would be helpful to know what the law is.\"\n\nIn 1984, following an investigation of campus life commissioned by the Board of Trustees, a decision was made to withdraw recognition from Colby's Greek system as it was seen to be \"exclusionary by nature\".\n\nNotable alumni\n\nAlumni, now numbering more than 25,000, are represented in all 50 states and 75 foreign countries. Alumni remain engaged with the college through alumni programs, affinity groups, and a directory and related services online, all offered by the Office of Alumni Relations.\n\nColby alumni include Governors Lot M. Morrill (ex-1869), Harris M. Plaisted (1881\u20131883), Nelson Dingley, Jr. (1874\u20131876), Llewellyn Powers (1901\u20131908), Benjamin Butler (1883\u20131884), Marcellus Stearns (1874\u20131877), and George A. Ramsdell (1897\u20131899).\n\nOther notable alumni include: Harvard Professor and White House Consultant Gregory Ciottone (1987),  former Barclays Chief Executive Officer Robert Diamond (1973), U.S. Senator from Florida (1969\u20131974) Edward Gurney (1935), abolitionist Elijah P. Lovejoy (1826),  Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs and U.S. State Department Spokesman Sean McCormack (1986), mathematician and founding member of the Institute for Advanced Study Marston Morse (1914), President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Eric S. Rosengren (1979), former White House Chief of Staff Pete Rouse (1968), author Doris Kearns Goodwin (1964), pathologist and author Stephen Sternberg (1941), and academic and author of the Spenser detective novels Robert B. Parker (1954), Pulitzer-Prize winning author Gregory White Smith (1973), political analyst Amy Walter (1991), Political Director of ABC News, former house editor for the Cook Political Report, Editor in Chief of The Hotline,  and NFL General Manager Eric DeCosta of the Baltimore Ravens (1993).\n\nPresidents of Colby\n\nThe Administration is made up of the president, officers, a board of trustees with faculty and student representation, and a board of overseers.  Since the founding of the college in 1813, 20 presidents have served, with Colby alumni having served as four Presidents of the college: Albion Woodbury Small, class of 1876, President from 1889 to 1892; Nathaniel Butler Jr., class of 1873, President from 1896 to 1901; Arthur J. Roberts, class of 1890, President from 1908 to 1927; and Franklin W. Johnson, class of 1891, President from 1929 to 1942.  David Greene currently serves in the role since 2014.\n\nInsignia and other representations\n\nSeal and motto\n\"Lux Mentis Scientia\", meaning \"knowledge is the light of the mind\", is the college's motto.  \n  \nThe college was originally authorized to have a seal by its founding charter, granted by the Massachusetts General Court in 1813, in section 4. Presently, the seal figures prominently on college diplomas as well as other official communications and merchandise.\n\nHistory and Revisions\n  \nThe history of the seal tracks both the history of the school, which began under the name Maine Literary and Theological Institution, and sigillography generally. The earliest known seal came while the school was called Colby University.  It featured a sun in splendour with eight straight rays above the school's Latin motto.  Surrounding the center are the words \"Sigillum Universitatis Colbianae,\" meaning \"the seal of Colby College\", and two crossed olive branch with five leaves each.  In 1899 the \"university\" was renamed Colby College, and a new seal was created with minor artistic changes to reflect the school's new name.\n\n  \n  \nIn 1936, President Franklin W. Johnson commissioned William Addison Dwiggins to design a seal to replace the one then existing, specifying only that it (1) used the same motto as the first and (2) retain the sun as the central theme.  The cost of the design was $50.  The face on the sun was removed and the lettering and its positioning was changed.\n\nIn 2002, the college contracted with design firm Corey McPherson Nash for updates to its entire visual identity system, including the seal.  The current seal is set in Perpetua typeface around a sunburst.  The seal is registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as a trademark under registration number 2773337.

The species reaches 18.8 cm (7.4 inches) in standard length and is believed to be a facultative air-breather. Its specific epithet, paucipunctatus, is derived from Latin and means \"few-dotted\", in reference to the color pattern sported by the species.\n\nReferences \n\nFish of South America\nFish described in 2005\npaucipunctatus", "Ratones Coloraos (\"Red Mice\") was a Spanish premiere late-night television talk show series which was aired from 2002 to 2010. The television series was broadcast in two different time frames from 2002 to 2005 and then from 2007 to 2010. The television series was presented by Jes\u00fas Quintero and the script was narrated by Javier Salvago. The television show was widely regarded as a premier television show in Spain as it included interviews with politicians and various celebrities from across the world. The show was broadcast on Canal Sur, Telemadrid, ETB2, 7RM, RTPA and TVE Internacional.\n\nCast \n\n Jes\u00fas Quintero in 13 episodes\n Pozi in 9 episodes\n El Risitas in 9 episodes\n\nHistory\n\nFirst season (2002\u20132005) \nIn 2002, Jesus Quintero makes the jump to the first Andalusian chain with the television programme after spending four years in South Channel 2 with the vagabond, space that became very popular mainly due to the programs of zapping of other chains in which collected excerpts from interviews with characters such as Risitas, El Pe\u00edto and El Poz\u00ed.\n\nSuch change of chain meant a larger budget for production which considerably expanded the sets and included an unheard element in Quintero's programs: the live audience. During the first season aired in between the 20 November 2002 and June 2003, the one of Huelva manages to locate the space like the flagship of South Channel. The success meant that the Basque regional government, ETB, reached an agreement with the production company of the space to broadcast a series of thirteen programs during the summer resulting from the recovery of the one already broadcast in Andalusia. Although the Basque public did not receive it with the same enthusiasm and, after several schedule changes, ended up relegated almost in the morning with an average of 14.7% share.\n\nIn October 2003, South Channel released the second season of the program which was broadcast until September 2004. Unlike the previous one, 5 different sets were used in the second season and two new sections were included. Again, another FORTA channel would bet on the program by including it on its grid, Telemadrid, since April 2004, where it did not have the expected success stagnating at an average of 14.4% share. At this stage, the program became tremendously popular throughout Spain by offering the first interview given by Isabel Pantoja after her relationship with Juli\u00e1n Mu\u00f1oz was made public. In the summer of the same year and after reaching an agreement with the producer of the space, TVE International broadcasts 13 programs with great success, especially in Latin America.\n\nThe premiere of the third season of Ratones Coloraos on Canal Sur was delayed until January 2005, remaining on the air until June. The space moved to prime time on Mondays, covering the space left vacant by Los Morancos. Quintero makes changes to the set and relies on a new director, David Gordon, film director, who permeated a much slower pace in the space. Nevertheless, this would be the season of greater success of the program until the moment, obtaining in the first delivery, where an exclusive interview with the Farruquito dancer was included, a 37.5% of share. In mid-February, Jes\u00fas Quintero is hospitalized due to an illness that was never made public, although the broadcast of the space was not interrupted thanks to the large amount of material he had left recorded. In September 2005, TVE announced the signing of the Andalusian communicator to present a program similar to La 1.\n\nSecond season (2007\u20132010) \nAfter his adventure in a national medium, Quintero returned to the Andalusian region in September 2007 recovering the format of what years before had been Mice Coloraos: interviews, humor, live music and reflections, in the prime time of the Tuesday. As a novelty, the space is recorded on a new set that the journalist has built in the center of Seville, and again has the realization of Hugo Stuven, who already collaborated with him in the early stages of the 'space. A month later, Telemadrid trusts him again and schedules one-hour reissues on late night and prime time on Wednesdays. Once again, the Madrid public does not respond and the program is withdrawn after thirteen broadcasts. In April 2010, Canal Sur decided to withdraw the space due to lack of budget. In December 2012, it began to schedule rebroadcasts of the best programs in the mornings from Tuesday to Thursday.\n\nLegacy \nThe show also generated internet meme fest in 2015 based on one of the interviews in the program with popular comedian El Risitas which was aired in June 2007. El Risitas in the interview in June 2007 with Jes\u00fas Quintero described an incident when he worked as a kitchen porter. He describes leaving some paella pans (paelleras) at night in the ocean to soak and clean, and when in the morning he returned to retrieve the pans, they had washed out to sea with the tide. He frequently interrupts the story with his trademark laugh. The video clip of it became viral on Reddit and on YouTube in 2015 triggering hilarious memes based on El Risitas's trademark laugh.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\n \n\nSpanish-language television shows", "The 1995 Tendring District Council election was held on 4 May 1995.

The part of the Waikato River from the Waihohonu Stream, down to Lake Taupo, was formally named the Tongariro River in 1945. The river originates in the Central Plateau of the North Island where it is fed by numerous tributaries (such as the Whitikau, Poutu, and Mangamawhitiwhiti streams) that flow off the surrounding hill ranges  and mountains such as Mount Ruapehu. It then winds its way north, through the township of Turangi before entering Lake Taupo via a number of river mouths. The minimum volume of water flowing down the lower Tongariro River ranges from approximately  (recorded at the upper rivers Poutu Intake) to  (recorded at the lower rivers Major Jones Pool). This volume can substantially increase due to catchment of rainfall by the surrounding mountains and hill ranges.\n\nRecreation\n\nFishing\nThe Tongariro River is New Zealand's most fished river, and is a drawcard for anglers the world over, who come to the Tongariro to fish for spawning rainbow trout and brown trout, which run up the river from the lake to spawn over the colder winter months. Approximately 75% of the trout in the Tongariro are rainbow trout, and 25% are brown trout.\n\nUnusually for a New Zealand river, the pools on the Tongariro River have officially accepted names. Pools on the Tongariro River are usually named after historical people who have fished the river (Major Jones Pool, Duchess Pool), or their geographic location (Birch Pool, Fence Pool, Redhut Pool). Floods have significantly altered the size and shape of many of these pools (such as in 2004 when the Breakaway Pool was completely lost due a change in the rivers direction), while others such as the Major Jones Pool have remained relatively unchanged in the last 50 years. A list of the pools and their locations can be found at List of pools of the Tongariro River.\n\nFishing techniques that prove to be popular include nymphing, wet lining and dry fly techniques. A fly fishing casting technique similar to a single handed spey cast called the Tongariro roll cast was developed on this river. The name was coined by Herb Spannagl who noticed its use on the Tongariro and felt it was sufficiently different from other casting techniques. The Tongariro roll cast is used to cast a fly line in situations where there are obstacles behind the caster that obstruct the angler from using traditional fly casting techniques.\nThe Tongariro River has 3 main sections of whitewater; named 'Access 14', 'Access 13' and 'Access 10'. These sections are the most popular on the Tongariro and provide grade 4, 3+ and 3 whitewater respectively. Lesser run sections of grade 2 exist, the first of which runs down to the put-in of Access 14 and the lower section runs from Blue Pool to Turangi. Sections of nearly unpaddleable whitewater fill the two main gorges, Tree Trunk Gorge and Waikato Gorge.\n\nRecreational releases \n\nThe New Zealand Resource Management Act 1991  dictates that as part of mitigation for the loss of recreational amenities on the Tongariro River, Genesis Energy must divert water into natural riverbed for 3 weekends per year. This is purely for recreational enjoyment and separate from any maintenance or flushing flows that are otherwise necessary. The dates for these releases are set in conjunction with the national body WhitewaterNZ and generally are structured such that Access 10 releases are on a Saturday and Access 14/13 are on the Sunday of the same weekend. Flows of  are released from Rangipo Dam for a duration of 8 hours.  Flows of 30 cumecs are released from the Poutu Intake for 6 hours. The Access 14/13 sections are not able to be paddled without a release from Genesis Energy, due to the fact that the minimum required flow from below Rangipo Dam is negligible in terms of whitewater and the intake structure at Rangipo is able to take huge amounts of water; so if there is extra storm flow in these sections the flow is generally dangerously high. Access 10 is able to be paddled year-round as the minimum flow of  below Poutu Intake is paddleable - albeit scratchy, and the amount of extra water able to be taken during storm events at Poutu Intake is relatively small so water is often spilled into the river.\n\nSee also\nWaikato River\nList of pools of the Tongariro River\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nTongariro River webcamera\nTongariro River Map\nAdvocates for the Tongariro River\nHydrology Information at Major Jones pool\n\nTaup\u014d District\nRivers of Waikato\nRapids of New Zealand\nRivers of New Zealand\nTributaries of the Waikato River", "\u00c1lvaro Octavio Meli\u00e1n Lafinur (16 May 1893 \u2013 1958) was an Argentinian poet and critic.\n\nBorn in Buenos Aires in 1893, he was the son of the Uruguayan lawyer and writer Luis Meli\u00e1n Lafinur and also the second cousin of writer Jorge Luis Borges.

Originally settled by Christopher Stokes in 1834 and known as Stoke's Hollow, later King Creek, the community grew around his grist mill and later included a flour mill, general store, shoe shop and in 1866 a Post Office. In July 1937, a plan of subdivision was registered for Humber Trails as a summer residential district nestled in the valley around King Creek west of Mill Road. After Hurricane Hazel, in the fall of 1954, the Toronto Regional Park Authority expropriated the land creating the Humber Trails Conservation area. One street named Elmpine Trails, on the south side of the King Creek, was not expropriated as the homes were on high ground with no chance of a flood damaging the houses. Several properties on Mill Road were also not expropriated for the same reason. For approximately fifteen years the Humber Trails Conservation Area was a manicured park. However a decision was made to allow the park to become a nature preserve. Today there are few signs that streets and homes and later, a manicured park had existed in the valley, except for a few walking paths and a King Creek post office structure that was assimilated into the buildings of a private residence and working farm located on either side of Mill Road.

The academy was established by royal decree of Philip V of Spain on 18 April 1738.\n\nBuilding\nSince 1836 the academy has occupied an 18th-century building designed by the neoclassical architect Juan de Villanueva. The building was originally occupied by the Hieronymites, a religious order. It became available as a result of legislation in the 1830s confiscating monastic properties (the ecclesiastical confiscations of Mendiz\u00e1bal).\n\nCollections\n\nAs formerly the main Spanish institution for antiquaries, the academy retains significant libraries and collections of antiquities, which cannot be seen by the public. The keeper of antiquities is the prehistorian Mart\u00edn Almagro Gorbea.\n\nItems held include:\n The Glosas Emilianenses\n The C\u00f3dice de Roda\n The San Mill\u00e1n Beatus\n The Missorium of Theodosius I, a large ceremonial silver dish, probably made in Constantinople for the tenth anniversary (decennalia) in 388 of the reign of the emperor Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule both the Eastern and Western Empires. It is one of the best surviving examples of Late Antique Imperial imagery and one of finest examples of late Roman goldsmith work.\n\nCriticism\nSome Spanish historians have considered it an obsolete misogynist institution, that still considers history as a matter of kings and battles. However, the image has changed since Carmen Iglesias, the first female director, took over in 2014 from Gonzalo Anes. By some authors RAH is considered a \"thoroughly undemocratic\" institution \"unrepresentative of Spanish historical profession\" and a hotbed of historical revisionism.\n\nBiographical work\n\nBiographical dictionary\n\nIn 2011 the Academy published the first 20 volumes of a dictionary of national biography, the Diccionario Biogr\u00e1fico Espa\u00f1ol, to which some five thousand historians contributed. The publicly funded publication has been subject of controversy for failing to achieve the standards of objectivity associated with, for example, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. The British Dictionary restricted itself to persons who were deceased, and the historian Henry Kamen has argued that it was a mistake for its Spanish equivalent to include living figures among entries. However, while there was criticism of entries for some living people (such as the politician Esperanza Aguirre), the main allegations of bias concern articles relating to Francoist Spain. A notable example was the entry on Francisco Franco, written by Luis Su\u00e1rez Fern\u00e1ndez, in which Franco is defined as an autocratic head of state rather than a dictator. In contrast, the dictionary reportedly defames individuals such as Juan Negr\u00edn, the last prime minister of the Second Republic.\n\nThe dictionary sparked an outcry. Most objections came from voices on the left such as the party United Left and the newspaper P\u00fablico. For his part, Green party senator Joan Saura asked for publication of the dictionary to be stopped and the offending volumes withdrawn. There was also a call for corrections from the Ministry of Education. The academy announced in June 2011 that amendments would be made to the text online and in future paper editions. In 2012, when the Minister of Education, Culture and Sport, made a statement on the subject of the dictionary, it was still not clear whether the academy was willing to describe Franco as a dictator. Carmen Iglesias, director of the academy, vowed to modify the online version in 2015. In 2018 a ceremony was held at El Pardo to launch the online edition, Diccionario Biografico Electronico. Franco's status as a dictator was confirmed.\n\nMetro collaboration\nIn 2015 the academy entered into an initiative in collaboration with Metro de Madrid to provide information about people who have given their names to metro stations. Stations named after people include Concha Espina and Paco de Lucia. Display panels have been placed in the stations in question.\n\nMonuments and memorials removed during the George Floyd protests\nIn 2020 the academy issued a statement \"deploring\" recent attacks on statues of figures from Spanish history, such as Christopher Columbus, which had taken place as part of the George Floyd protests. It reaffirmed its \"commitment to the knowledge of Spain\u2019s actions in America, beyond the falsification, the distortion and the partisan manipulation.\u201d\n\nNumerary members\nPer article 6 of its statutes, the Real Academia de la Historia is composed of a maximum of 36 \"numbered academics\" who must be Spanish citizens. There are also academics of honour and academic correspondents, who may be of any nationality.

She was awarded the titles of International Master and Woman Grandmaster by FIDE in 2019. Salimova won the Bulgarian women's championship in 2017. In 2023, she won the silver medal in her country\u2019s national chess championship and was the only woman to compete in the open section.\n\nBiography\nSalimova was born in the village of   Krepcha (Targovishte Province). She learnt to play chess at the age of four. In 2011, in Albena she won the European Youth Chess Championship for girls under 8. In 2015, in Porto Carras Salimova won the World Youth Chess Championship for girls under 12. In 2015, she also won European Union Youth Chess Championship for girls under 12. She is a multiple winner of Bulgarian and European Youth Chess Championships in fast and blitz chess for girls in different age groups.\n\nSalimova won the Bulgarian Women's Chess Championship in 2017.\nIn 2018 Salimova was invited to play in one of the strongest tournaments ever - Tata Steel group C.\nIn April 2018 Salimova became Bulgarian champion in the section G16 and 2 days later, Bulgarian blitz champion in the boys' section under 16.\nIn May 2018, Nurgyul Salimova won the Bayonne open with a performance of 2600+, enough for a GM norm.\nIn July 2018, Salimova scored her last WIM, first IM and first WGM norm at Pardubice, Czech Republic with a performance of 2478. Thanks to that, her rating went up to 2352 and she became the #2 in the under 16 girls world rankings, #2 among Bulgarian women and #11 in the world list for girls under 20. In September she took part in the Serbian women league with the team of \u2018\u2019Banovci Dunav\u2019\u2019. Salimova played at the second board and scored 8/10 (without losses) with a performance of 2400+. This gave her a second WGM norm. The team did poorly and finished in last place.\n\nSalimova scored her last WGM and second IM norm in December 2018 at the age of 15 in Zadar, Croatia with a performance of 2492.   \nIn April 2019, at the European Women's Individual Chess Championships, Salimova scored her last (valid) WGM norm and became a WGM at the age of 15 years and 10 months. She also earned the right to participate in the Women's World Cup.\n\nIn January 2022, at Vergani Cup January edition, Salimova got her first GM norm after defeating the former world championship challenger GM Nigel Short.\n\nIn the 2023 Bulgarian Chess Championships, she ended half a point short of first place. Although she tied for second place with two others (both GMs), Salimova was awarded the silver medal because her tiebreak points were higher. In the tournament, she finished ahead of six GMs and lost only to the champion, the national legend GM Georgiev Kiril. The nine-round Swiss tournament was held January 21-28, 2023 in Sofia, Bulgaria.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nNurgyul Salimova chess games at 365Chess.com\n\n2003 births\nLiving people\nChess International Masters\nChess woman grandmasters\nPeople from Targovishte Province\nBulgarian female chess players\nWorld Youth Chess Champions", "\n\nLa prima e unica stagione della serie televisiva Rango \u00e8 andata in onda negli Stati Uniti dal 13 gennaio 1967 al 5 maggio 1967 sulla ABC.\n\nRango the Outlaw \n Prima televisiva: 13 gennaio 1967\n\nTrama \n\n Guest star: Ted de Corsia (Butch Durham), Ned Romero (Hocker), Herbie Faye (negoziante), John Cliff (Crandall), Michael Carr (caporale Medwin)\n\nThe Daring Holdup of the Deadwood Stage \n Prima televisiva: 20 gennaio 1967\n\nTrama \n\n Guest star: Roxanne Arlen (Stella), Troy Melton (conducente della diligenza), Leo Gordon (Slade), Kent Taylor (Bancroft), Ernie Anderson (predicatore), Parley Baer (Wilkins)\n\nThe Town Tamer \n Prima televisiva: 27 gennaio 1967\n\nTrama \n\n Guest star: Paul Richards (Duke), Robert Strauss (Blackie)\n\nGunfight at the K.O.

He represented Bonavista Bay in the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly from 1886 to 1906 as a Conservative and from 1913 to 1916 as a member of the Fishermen's Protective Union.\n\nBiography \nHe was born in Port Medway, Nova Scotia, the son of Alred Morine and Mary Dolliver, and was educated in Port Medway and Liverpool. Morine was editor for newspapers in Nova Scotia and then for the Evening Mercury in St. John's. He ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Newfoundland assembly in 1885. James L. Noonan was named to the Executive Council in 1885, which required him to run for reelection: Noonan was defeated by Morine in an 1886 by-election. In 1892, Morine entered the study of law at Dalhousie University, was called to the Newfoundland and Nova Scotia bars in 1894 and set up practice in St. John's.  Morine ran unsuccessfully for a Nova Scotia seat in the Canadian House of Commons in 1892. He married Alice Mason in 1894.\n\nIn 1894, Morine convinced the Tory opposition to file petitions against a number of elected Liberals under the Corrupt Practices Act; this resulted in 15 Liberals, including the Premier William Whiteway, and one Independent member being unseated and the temporary return of the Tories to power. Morine was named colonial secretary in the Executive Council. The unseated members were barred from running in future elections; however, this restriction was later removed when the Liberals returned to power following a series of by-elections to fill the vacated seats. During the brief Conservative time in power, the colony suffered a financial crisis after two banks failed unexpectedly. When the Conservatives returned to power again in 1897, Morine was named to the Executive Council as Minister of Finance. He negotiated a long-term contract with Robert Gillespie Reid for the expansion of the railway in Newfoundland; the contract was unpopular with both Newfoundlanders and the British government because it was believed to be too generous to the Reid family. At the time, Morine was also acting as solicitor for the Reids. The Liberals were returned to power in 1900, with the railway contract being a major issue in the election. Morine was now leader of the Conservative opposition.\n\nIn 1906, he resigned his seat in the Newfoundland assembly, moved to Toronto, was called to the Ontario bar and set up practice in Toronto. Morine ran unsuccessfully in the riding of Shelburne and Queen's in the 1908 federal election. He returned to Newfoundland in 1912 and was elected to the assembly in a by-election held the following year. He resigned his seat in 1916 and returned to Toronto. Morine was named Minister of Justice in the Newfoundland Executive Council in 1919; he was defeated by William Coaker when he ran for reelection. He served in the Legislative Council of Newfoundland from 1924 to 1928. He was knighted in 1928. Morine died in Toronto at the age of 87.\n\nReferences \n \n\nFishermen's Protective Union MHAs\nMembers of the Legislative Council of Newfoundland\n1837 births\n1944 deaths\nOntario candidates for Member of Parliament\nCandidates in the 1908 Canadian federal election\nCanadian emigrants to pre-Confederation Newfoundland\nDominion of Newfoundland politicians\nColonial Secretaries of Newfoundland", "Edward Buncombe (1742\u20131778) was a plantation owner from the Province of North Carolina who served as a colonel in the North Carolina militia and Continental Army (the army of the Patriot side) in the American Revolutionary War.  He is the namesake of Buncombe County in western North Carolina. In 1820, his surname (in its status as the name of that county) became the source of the derogatory American slang term, \"bunkum\" and its shortened form, \"bunk\" in consequence of the U.S. representative for the county, Felix Walker, invoking the county during a poorly received speech delivered on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nBiography\nBuncombe was born in 1742 on the West Indies island of St. Christopher (today St. Kitts). He grew up there and in England. He immigrated to North Carolina in 1768 and settled at a plantation he had inherited near the shore of Albemarle Sound on the Atlantic coast, in what is now Washington County. In 1774, as the independence movement of the Thirteen Colonies gathered steam, he took a leading role in convening proindependence meetings, especially the First Provincial Congress, which is reportedly the first assembly anywhere in the Thirteen Colonies to defy a royal governor. \n\nService record:\nTyrrell County Regiment, North Carolina militia (1775-1777)\n9/9/1775, a Colonel in the Tyrrell County Regiment of militia.   \n4/15/1776 until his death in May 1778, Colonel of the 5th North Carolina Regiment  \n10/4/1777, captured at Germantown, POW in Philadelphia, paroled  \nMay 1778, fell down a flight of stairs, reopened old wounds, died as a result.  \n\nHe joined a local militia, the Tyrrell County Regiment of the North Carolina militia. The \"Halifax Assembly\" elected him colonel of the 5th North Carolina Regiment of the Continental Army on April 15, 1776 (three days after it had passed the historic Halifax Resolves). He was wounded and captured on October 4, 1777 at the Battle of Germantown, fought several miles outside of the rebel capital of Philadelphia, which the British had recently seized. The British army paroled him to that city. The following May 1778, Col. Buncombe fell down some stairs while sleepwalking and his wounds reopened, causing him to bleed to death. He is buried in Christ Church Burial Ground in Philadelphia.\n\nTax records of 1782 say that his estate included  of land and 10 Negroes.\n\nIn 1791, the State of North Carolina created a new county from parts of two other counties and named it for Col. Buncombe. The present Buncombe County is a combination of parts of the original one with parts of neighboring counties.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nAshe, Samuel. 1905.

In 1987, he was kidnapped and held for ransom by Danny Edwards and Nancy Rish. The conditions of his confinement caused him to die of asphyxiation. As a result, Edwards was given the death penalty (later commuted) and Rish was sentenced to life in prison without parole.\n\nBiography\nSmall was born in 1947 and raised in Kankakee, Illinois. His parents, Burrell and Reva Small, owned and operated a media conglomerate called Mid America Media; the Small family also owned the controlling interest in United Press International; and this is where Small himself worked. His great grandfather was Illinois governor Len Small. Stephen Small had received his education at Lake Forest Academy, the University of Denver and Mark Hopkins College.  In 1969, he married Nancy Pedersen, with whom he had three sons.\n\nKidnapping\nAround 12:30\u00a0a.m. on September 2, 1987, someone claiming to be a Kankakee police officer called the Small home and told Stephen Small that a burglary had occurred at the B. Harley Bradley House, a property that Small owned and was in the process of renovating. Small got dressed and left his home. Around 3:30 that morning someone called the Small residence and told Stephen's wife, Nancy, \"We have your husband.\" Nancy then heard her husband say that he had been handcuffed inside a box underground. Small told his wife to obtain\u2007$1 million in cash. The caller directed Mrs. Small not to report the matter to the police.\nThe matter was reported to the authorities, however, and devices were connected to the Smalls' telephone line to record incoming calls and to determine their origins. At 5:03 that afternoon, the same person called again, asking Mrs. Small how much money had been collected. This call was placed from a telephone located at a Phillips 66 gas station in Aroma Park. Edwards was seen there at that time, in the company of a blonde-haired woman.\nAt 5:40\u00a0p.m., Jean Alice Small, Stephen Small's aunt, telephoned the Small residence to tell them of a call she had just received. Jean said that the caller had told her that he knew that Nancy Small's telephone was tapped. After telling Jean that the victim was buried, the caller threatened to kill Jean's husband. Nancy Small received another telephone call from the kidnapper at 11:28 that night. This call originated from a telephone at a Sunoco station in Aroma Park, where an FBI agent saw a white male at a telephone, and a blonde-haired woman in a car that was later identified as belonging to Nancy Rish, Edwards' girlfriend; Rish had blonde hair. The caller played a tape recording of Stephen Small's voice. On the tape, Stephen provided instructions for delivering the ransom. After audio enhancement, a voice in the background could be heard threatening Small.\n\nTracking and arrest of Edwards and Rish\nNancy Small received one more telephone call from the kidnapper, at 11:46 that night. The call was placed from a Marathon service station in Kankakee. The caller accused Nancy of having notified the police and refused her offer of the ransom. Minutes later, at 11:50\u00a0p.m., an Illinois State Police officer saw Rish's car, with its trunk partly open, driving from Kankakee toward Aroma Park.\nLaw enforcement officers then placed Edwards' home under surveillance. They saw a dark-colored Buick, with its trunk partly open, arrive at the house in Bourbonnais where Edwards and Rish lived. Edwards and a white woman with blonde hair left the car and went inside.\nOfficers carried out a search of the residence later that morning, on September 3, Rish and Edwards were arrested at that time. Later that day, Edwards led law enforcement officers to the site where the victim was buried. There, officers dug up a wooden box and found the victim's body inside. The box measured about six feet long and three feet wide, and was constructed of plywood. It contained a light connected to an automotive battery, a one gallon jug of water, candy bars, gum, and a flashlight.\nA medical examiner later determined that the victim died of asphyxiation caused by suffocation. The medical examiner believed that the victim would not have survived more than three or four hours inside the enclosed box. The medical examiner noted that the pipe extending from the box into the open air was too long for its diameter to serve as an adequate air-exchange system.\n\nEdwards trial\nThe State presented other evidence connecting Edwards to these offenses. On the night of the victim's disappearance, around midnight, a neighbor of Edwards heard Edwards say, \"Let's go, let's hit it,\" get into his car, and drive off. Also, two neighbors of the Small family saw Edwards' van, or one similar to it, parked in their neighborhood after midnight on September 2. One neighbor also noticed a mid-sized car at that time, heard two car doors slam, and saw the car and Edwards' van drive away with their lights off.\nSeveral witnesses saw Edwards constructing a wooden box in his garage during summer 1987, preceding the offenses here. Edwards gave various explanations for what he was going to do, saying that it would be used for a lemonade stand, or by his brother for transporting things, or at his brother's pool in Florida. A neighbor of the Smalls had seen a white van similar to Edwards' van driving through an alley next to the Smalls' home about 10 times that summer. While Edwards and Rish were visiting a boat store that summer, Edwards saw Stephen Small leaving the store in a sports car; Edwards was heard to say, \"Boy, it sure would be nice to afford stuff like that.\"\nThe search of Edwards's residence at the time of his arrest turned up a Kankakee telephone book with the name \"Small\" circled. Edwards' boots were found behind a washer and dryer at the residence, and soil on the boots matched a sample from the location where the box was buried. Soil in Edwards' van also matched the sample. White caulking material on gloves found in Edwards' trash had the same chemical composition as the caulking material used to fill in the seams of the wooden box in which the victim had been buried. Edwards' fingerprints were found on PVC pipe and duct tape recovered from the box.\nA person who owed Edwards money had had a pair of handcuffs stolen from him, and the same pair was later discovered on the victim. Another person who owed Edwards money had had a gun stolen, and it was found by investigators in the countryside near Aroma Park. Edwards purchased a battery that was found in the wooden box. Bolt cutters belonging to a company owned by Edwards' brother were found at a point between where the box was uncovered and where the victim's car was found, and they could have been the implement used to cut the chain connecting the handcuffs on the victim's wrists.\n\nEdwards sentence\nAt the close of evidence, the jury found Edwards guilty of first degree murder and aggravated kidnapping. A capital sentencing hearing was then conducted. At the first stage of the hearing, the jury found Edwards eligible for the death penalty because of his commission of murder during the course of another felony, aggravated kidnapping.\n\nNancy Rish\nOn September 2, 1987, during the kidnapping and murder of Kankakee business man Stephen B. Small, the investigation focused on Danny Edwards and Nancy Rish, who lived together in a townhouse in Bourbonnais.\nOn September 4, a search warrant was executed for the townhouse. That evening, Edwards led the police to a rural area where Small's body was recovered. It appeared that Small had been placed in a wooden box which had been fitted with a PVC pipe designed to give him air for 24 to 48 hours. Small's wrists were handcuffed and the box was buried. The coroner later determined that his death was caused by \"asphyxia due to suffocation.\"\nThat same night, the police arrested Rish and held her at the station for questioning. Rish requested a specific attorney, J. Scott Swaim, who had previously represented her, and she was given an opportunity to obtain his counsel. Rish did not know that Swaim was friends with the victim.\nFor the next four days, between September 4 and September 8, the police questioned Rish with counsel present. Eight statements were elicited concerning her knowledge and actions in the early days of September. None of the statements was totally consistent with any other.\n\nRish trial\nOn October 1, Rish was charged by indictment with first-degree murder and aggravated kidnapping for her alleged role in Small's death. On November 2, 1988, Rish was tried by a jury. No direct evidence was presented linking her to the kidnapping or death of Small. However, the State was able to enter Rish's eight inconsistent statements into evidence. Witnesses were also presented who testified that they had seen her at various times with Edwards when he was purchasing some of items that were ultimately found with Small's body. Other witnesses reported that they had observed her at various related locations during the course of the kidnaping and ransom calls. Lastly, the State submitted evidence that Edwards had used their garage to build the box in which Small's body was found. The jury found Rish guilty on both counts, and the trial court sentenced her to a term of natural life imprisonment and a concurrent 30-year term.\n\nRyan commutation\nOn January 11, 2003, Illinois Governor George Ryan, a native of Kankakee, commuted all death row sentences in Illinois to life imprisonment. This act commuted the sentence of Danny Edwards who had murdered Ryan's next-door neighbor Stephen Small. This is what Ryan had to say about the Small case at the time of the commutation: \"I grew up in Kankakee which even today is still a small midwestern town, a place where people tend to know each other. Steve Small was a neighbor. I watched him grow up. He would babysit my young children \u2013 which was not for the faint of heart since Lura Lynn and I had six children, five of them under the age of 3. He was a bright young man who helped run the family business. He got married and he and his wife had three children of their own. Lura Lynn was especially close to him and his family. We took comfort in knowing he was there for us and we for him. One September midnight he received a call at his home. There had been a break-in at the nearby house he was renovating. But as he left his house, he was seized at gunpoint by kidnappers. His captors buried him alive in a shallow hole. He suffocated to death before police could find him. His killer led investigators to where Steve's body was buried. The killer, Danny Edwards, was also from my hometown. He now sits on death row. I also know his family. I share this story with you so that you know I do not come to this as a neophyte without having experienced a small bit of the bitter pill the survivors of murder must swallow. My responsibilities and obligations are more than my neighbors and my family. I represent all the people of Illinois \u2013 like it or not. The decision I make about our criminal justice system is felt not only here, but the world over.\"\n\nMedia\nOn February 19, 2018, James Patterson's Murder Is Forever on the Investigation Discovery channel featured the kidnapping and murder of Small in an episode entitled \"Murder Beyond the Grave\".\n\nSee also\nList of kidnappings\nList of solved missing person cases\n\nReferences\n\n1947 births\n1980s missing person cases\n1987 deaths\n1987 murders in the United States\n20th-century American businesspeople\nAmerican murder victims\nBusinesspeople from Illinois\nFormerly missing people\nDeaths from asphyxiation\nKidnapped American people\nLake Forest Academy alumni\nMale murder victims\nMissing person cases in Illinois\nPeople from Kankakee, Illinois\nPeople murdered in Illinois", "Fina or FINA may refer to:\n\n FINA (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Natation), the original name of World Aquatics, the international governing body for aquatic sports\n Fina (architecture), a narrow public space immediately alongside buildings\n Fina, a main character in the Skies of Arcadia video game\n Fina, a nickname for Trenbolone, an anabolic steroid\n FINA, the North American Forum on Integration (Le Forum sur l'Int\u00e9gration Nord-Am\u00e9ricaine)\n Petrofina, a Belgian petroleum company (known as FINA in the United States and the United Kingdom)\n Saint Fina, a 13th-century saint\n\nSee also\n Fin (disambiguation)\n Final (disambiguation)\n Finna (disambiguation)\n FINAA, Finnish Aviation Academy", "This is a list of aquaria (public aquariums).

In his youth, he studied with Rabbi Simcha Zissel Ziv at the Talmud Torah in Grobi\u0146a, Latvia, but was eventually expelled from the school for his \"heretical tendencies.\"  He went on to attend a high school in Switzerland, and he then studied medicine and biology in Heidelberg and Berlin.\n\nElyashev's pen name was Bal-Makhshoves (), meaning \"Master [of] Thoughts\" or \"The Thinker\".\n\nElyashev is best known for his work as a literary critic, writing in Yiddish.  He translated Theodor Herzl's Altneuland from German into Yiddish, upon Herzl's personal request.  His Yiddish translation of Herzl's work is the language that by far- most of European Jewry had read of Herzl's calling for a Modern Jewish State.\n\nHis attitude to Jewish literature, Yiddish, and Hebrew is summed up by something that he wrote in 1918:\n\n[W]e have two languages and a dozen echoes from other foreign languages, but\u2026 we have only one literature. And therefore the reader who seeks to become acquainted with the currents of Jewish life, to comprehend the spirit of the Jewish individual and multitude and how they find expression in Jewish literature, that reader does not separate Hebrew writers from Yiddish ones. \u2026All are representatives of our literature, all embody a piece of Jewish life in their writings; all of them are Jewish artists.\n\nElyashev was also politically active, as a forerunner of the Zionist Movement.  He participated in the First Zionist Congress, held in Basel, Switzerland in August 1897, as a delegate from Germany .\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\nBal-Makhshoves, YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe\nBaal-Makhshoves books in the Yiddish Book Center collection\n\n1873 births\n1924 deaths\nLithuanian Jews\nZionists\nYiddish-language writers\nTranslators to Yiddish\nPhysicians from Kaunas\n20th-century translators\nWriters from Kaunas", "Randy Renfrow (born January 28, 1958) is an American former stock car racing driver. He raced many years in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series before retiring. Renfrow has won 237 late model races at 40 different tracks over his career.\n\nNextel Cup Series\nRenfrow attempted numerous races in early 2002, all for Price Motorsports. However, Renfrow only made one race. He would start and finish 43rd (last) on the spring field at Richmond. He only competed 58 laps in that race before retiring due to oil pump failure.\n\nCraftsman Truck Series\nRenfrow started his CTS career in 1996, running seven races. His debut came for the #41 George Turnage Dodge team at Bristol. He started the race in 15th position, but finished 27th after mechanical issues. In fact, Renfrow would only finish one race in 1996, a race at Richmond in which he would finish 12th. It would prove to be his only top-20 finish on the year. However, Renfrow qualified well. He had two top-10 starts, the best being a 5th at Nashville.\n\nRenfrow competed in two races in 1997 for the Turnage team. He was 32nd at Bristol and 24th at Richmond, both without very much to comment on. He did not finish either race.\n\nRenfrow began 1998 running Dominic Dobson's #78 Dodge. In his first race at California, Renfrow qualified 4th. Renfrow then led his first career CTS laps at Pikes Peak, leading ten laps before fuel issues forced him out. He would also lead nine laps at Loudon, but the results were not there and Renfrow left the team. He drove the #61 IWX Chevy at Martinsville in his next start. There, he drove a solid race to 9th place. It was his first career CTS top 10. The run earned Renfrow a run in the #66 Ford for two races, and then the #84 Ford for the season finale. However, for those two teams, his best race was 26th at Vegas and neither ride resulted in a 1999 offer. Overall, he finished 30th in points.\n\nRenfrow would once again finish 30th in points during 1999. He started off his season by replacing the injured Rick Carelli in his #6 RE/MAX Chevy. However, in three starts, Renfrow only managed a best finish of 15th at I-70, before Carelli came back. Renfrow then moved back to the #41 Dodge, now owned by TKO Motorsports. He ran solidly in his six starts for that team. In his first start for the team, he started on the outside pole at Michigan, before finishing 26th. After that, he had five straight top-20 finishes to close out the year. This included a 9th at Richmond, matching his career best.\n\nThe late season for TKO earned Renfrow the full ride in 2000. In fourteen starts for the team, Renfrow managed four top-10s. This included his first career top-5 and eventual best career finish of fifth at Mesa Marin. Oddly, after the race at Milwaukee, Renfrow was released in favor of Jamie McMurray. Renfrow was 15th at that time in points, but only raced one more time in 2000. That was for Conely Motorsports at Texas, where he finished 30th.\n\nRenfrow returned to the series for three races in 2003. He drove the #66 MLB Motorsports Dodge in all three starts. However, the team was low-budget and the best Renfrow managed was 25th at Dover, even though he did not finish that race or any other of his 2003 starts.\n\nRenfrow has not raced in major NASCAR since. He continues to race Late Model cars occasionally at Wake County Speedway (Raleigh, N.C.), owns Randy Renfrow Race Cars, and is a crew chief in late model racing for Coulter Motorsports.\n\nMotorsports career results\n\nNASCAR\n(key) (Bold\u00a0- Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

People's Artist of the USSR (1963).\n\nEarly years\n\nHe was born Anatoly Petrovich Viktorov on April 24, 1898, in Moscow. His grandfather was a successful merchant, his father, named Pyotr Viktorov, was an industrial engineer. His mother was a pianist and singer.\n\nYoung Ktorov was brought up in artistic environment of Moscow's cultural milieu. He attended Classical Gymnasium in Moscow, and was fond of acting in school drama class. In 1916, at age 18, Ktorov became a student at the Acting School of Fyodor Komissarzhevsky, a stern acting coach who was critical of Ktorov's stuttering. But Ktorov, who was a shy person in real life, demonstrated his remarkable persistence and determination; he practiced his lines several hundred times. In 1917, Ktorov made his acting debut on stage of Komissarzhevsky Theatre. Ktorov's stuttering was noticeable only in his real life off-stage, but he never stuttered on-stage. However, director Komissarzhevsky did not believe in Ktorov, and his career seemed to be limited to cameo roles. Ktorov's fate was changed by Illarion Pevtsov who believed in Ktorov's talent and took him as prot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\nIn 1919, Pevtsov introduced Ktorov to Vera Popova. She was an established actress and experienced acting coach, she also recognized Ktorov's talent and took him under her wing. Eventually Popova became Ktorov's partner on stage and in life.\n\nCareer in cinema\nFrom 1920 to 1933, Ktorov was a permanent member of the troupe at Korsh Theatre in Moscow. There he played leading roles in classic dramas and comedies, as well as in contemporary plays, with Vera Popova as his permanent stage partner.\n\nIn 1925, Ktorov shot to fame with the leading role in the silent movie The Tailor from Torzhok (1925) by director Yakov Protazanov. He also gave an impressive performance in Protazanov's St. Jorgen's Day (1930). The highlight of Ktorov's career was his brilliant performance as Paratov in Without a Dowry (1936), a classic film by Yakov Protazanov.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1980, Ktorov was a permanent member of the troupe at Moscow Art Theatre.\n\nLater years\nAnatoly Ktorov was designated People's Artist of the USSR (1963), was awarded the Stalin Prize (1952), and received numerous decorations for his contribution to the art of film and theatre. He gave remarkable performances in his last film roles, which are considered to be his best works, one as Prince Bolkonsky in War and Peace (1967) by director Sergei Bondarchuk, and then as the King in The Ambassador of the Soviet Union (1969).\n\nAnatoly Ktorov died of natural causes on September 30, 1980, in Moscow, and was laid to rest in Vvedenskoye Cemetery in Moscow, Russia.\n\nFilmography\n\nThe Ambassador of the Soviet Union (1969) as King\nWar and Peace (1965-1967) as Prince Nikolai Andreyevich Bolkonsky\nShkola zlosloviya (1952) as Joseph Surface\nWithout a Dowry (1936) as Sergei Sergeyevich Paratov\nMarionettes (1934) as \"Do\" - The Prince\nZheleznaya brigada (1931)\nSt. Jorgen's Day (1930) as Kokris\nKto ty takoy?

He received national media attention in 2009 on his appointment as Minister of Economy and Planning following the government shake-up announced by Ra\u00fal Castro on 2 March 2009. Murillo retained this post until 25 March 2011, but was reappointed to it on 25 September 2014 to lead reform efforts in the economic sphere. On 14 July 2016 he was sacked from his post for a second time, and moved to a new role tackling market reforms.\n\nAs Minister of Economy and Planning, his role was to spearhead economic reforms initiated by Ra\u00fal Castro. Murillo's intention is to rid the Cuban economy of its paternalistic features by updating the economic system. Murillo dislikes the idea of Cuba copying the economic reforms of Vietnam and China, claiming that the newly established private markets will benefit socialism rather than capitalism.\n\nBackground\nLittle is known of Murillo's life before he became Minister of Economy and Planning in 2009. He was born on 19 February 1961,en Manzanillo, Cuba. and has a degree in economics from the Cuban National Defence College, and is a member of the Communist Party of Cuba. His official government biography states that he has \"been linked to the economic sphere for more than 20 years\" as Minister of Internal Trade, Deputy Minister of Economy and Planning and as an auditor for the Ministry of Food & Industry. He held the post of Minister of Internal Trade from 2006 until March 2, 2009 when he was succeeded by his First Deputy Minister Jacinto Angulo Pardo.\n\nMinister of Economy and Planning (2009\u20132011)\nDuring Ra\u00fal Castro's 2009 Cuban government shake-up, Murillo replaced Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Garc\u00eda as Minister of Economy and Planning and Vice President of the Council of Ministers. Murillo then appointed Abel Rodriguez to the First Deputyship of the ministry and Perez Betancourt to the Deputyship of the ministry. Early on during his tenure, Murillo criticised the paternalistic features of the Cuban economy. He also supported cutting the government's payroll by up 500,000 workers, a motion enacted but not completed.\n\nWhen Murillo took office the Cuban economy had been hard hit by the worldwide financial crisis of 2008. At the 7th Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba he stated that public debate was needed before implementing changes to the economic system, claiming \"that false unanimity is pernicious and debate and healthy disagreement must be encouraged\". Murillo also highlighted the importance of \"order and discipline, institutionalism, clear establishment of the duties and powers of every post and, above all, of convincing people of the need to work in order to satisfy their aspirations.\" His report was approved by the plenum. Murillo was elected a member of the Council of State in December 2009 to \"improve the planning process of the national economy\", according to Ra\u00fal Castro. By the end of 2009, Cuba's 2008 2.3 billion trade deficit had become a surplus of 400 million dollars. Murillo accomplished this through a 37.6 percent reduction in imports. The economy only grew 1.4 percent in 2009, down from 4.2 percent in the previous year. Initial planning had called for 6 percent, but as a result of the global financial crisis, earnings from important sectors such as tourism noticeably decreased. There was a 22.9 percent decrease in exports, and a 37.4 percent decrease in imports, highlighting Murillo's efforts to reduce government hard currency expenses.\n\nIn a speech to the National Assembly of People's Power, the Cuban Parliament in August 2010, Murillo was asked if Cuba would pursue changes similar to those seen in Vietnam and the People's Republic of China. He replied; \"I think the Cuban model is a very Cuban model. We cannot copy what many people in the world do\", and further noted that the strongest country in the world, the United States, was their enemy. He went on to say that with updating rather than reforming, the Cuban state economic system would remain highly centralised, although some businesses, such as barbers for instance, should not be directly controlled by the government. On the updating of the economic system he stated that newly established private markets would prioritise the interest of socialism, and not those of capitalism. At the December convocation of Cuba's parliament, Murillo took center stage to talk about the difficulties, inefficiencies and constraints of the Cuban economic model. He outlined proposed reforms and explained the inefficiencies of the economy, stating that Cuba's updated economic model would function as a hybrid planned and market economy, but that the planned economy would remain dominant.\n\n\"Reform czar\" (2011\u20132016)\nOn 25 March 2011 Murillo was replaced as Minister of Planning and Economy by Adel Yzquierdo Rodriguez. It is not clear whether this was a demotion; the official version being that Murillo was replaced so that he could concentrate his efforts on \"supervising the implementation of measures associated with the updating of the Cuban economic model\" as Chairman of the Economic Policy Commission of the 6th Party Congress. He does however retain overall control over the Ministry of Planning and Economy, as well as other \"productive sectors\". One foreign observer considered Murillo's position to be strengthened after his appointment as Chairman of the Economic Policy Commission, and referred to him as a \"superminister\" of economic reform. As commission chairman Murillo is in charge of implementing Ra\u00fal Castro's economic reforms.\n\nAt the Communist Party of Cuba's 6th Congress Murillo was elected to its Politburo. Murillo was considered to be one of Ra\u00fal Castro's possible successors as Cuban leader. According to an anonymous European diplomat in Havana, Murillo is the \"one to watch\".\n\nOffices held\n\nReferences\n\nGovernment ministers of Cuba\nLiving people\nCommunist Party of Cuba politicians\n1961 births", "Fort Sturgeon (1776\u20131780) was the first trading post on the North Saskatchewan River. It was located about 4 miles west of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan. It and was also called Peter Pond Fort, Fort Pond, Fort la Prairie, Fort des Prairies, Lower Settlement and Fort Sturgeon River.\n\nIt was located on the north bank of the river just east of the mouth of the Sturgeon River (Saskatchewan) in the Aspen parkland country. To the south the grassland made a sort of \"bay\" into the forest. The woods to the north provided furs and the grassland to the south buffalo for food.\n\nAbout 1775 a group of \"Pedlars\" (independent traders from Montreal) were downriver near the old Fort de la Corne.  Seeing the disadvantages of competition they formed a pool (in either 1775 or 1776) which by 1779 became the North West Company. Among them were Joseph Frobisher, Peter Pond, Peter Pangman, Nicholas Montour, William Bruce and Bartholomew Blondeau. In 1776 they moved upriver and built Fort Sturgeon. In the spring of 1778 Peter Pond set off with 5 canoes and 20 men, crossed the Methye Portage for the first time and wintered 30 miles south of Lake Athabasca. He returned next year with excellent furs, thereby opening up the Athabasca Country. In 1778 Pangman and Blondeau built a fort upstream near Silver Grove, Saskatchewan. In 1779 William Tomison of the HBC came up from Cumberland House and traded while the Pedlars were away. The post had more Indian troubles than most and there were several killings on both sides. In 1777 three men from Fort Sturgeon were killed allegedly for maltreatment of the Indians. In 1780 Indians burnt the fort to the ground when the traders were away.\n\nThe Pedlars returned and built a new post \"a little below the old House\". Morton guesses this was on the north bank opposite Betts Island 1.5 miles above the Prince Albert bridge. Peter Fidler passed by in 1792 and saw only ruins. In 1794 David Grant had a post on the Sturgeon River but did poorly because of NWC competition and inability to control his men. The XY Company (1798\u20131804) had a post two miles above the Sturgeon and both the HBC and NWC built competing post on the Sturgeon River itself. Innis mentions a \"Hudson's House\" built in 1776 above Prince Albert. The site is marked by a cairn at the end of Peter Pond Road off highway 3 four miles east of Prince Albert. The original site may have been washed away by the river.\n\nSee also\nSaskatchewan River fur trade\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nElizabeth Browne Losey, \"Let Them be Remembered: The Story of the Fur Trade Forts, 1999\nArthur Morton, \"A History of the Canadian West\", c.\u00a01936\n\nPedlars (fur trade)\nNorth West Company forts\nForts in Saskatchewan\nNorth Saskatchewan River", "Myleusnema bicornis is an intestinal parasite of Myleus ternetzi, or \"Ternetz's Silver Dollar\", a freshwater Characoid fish commonly found in the French Guiana river. M. bicornis has several unusual morphological characteristics, namely the two postcloacal \"horns\" in the posterior of males, and a separate elongated cephalic region (head) that may be extended and retracted. These features differ vastly from other Cosmocercoidean nematodes, as well as any others within the family Kathlaniidae, and as such necessitate the creation of the new genus Myleusnema; however, no genetic taxonomic studies have been performed.\n\nEtymology\nThe generic name derives from the Greek terms Myleus (generic name of fish host) and nema (short for nematode), whereas the specific name, bicornis, refers to the two postcloacal \"horns\" present on males.\n\nMorphology\nMyleusnema bicornis possess characteristics which are common for all nematodes: they are long and cylindrical with a \"worm-like\" shape, show bilateral symmetry, and contain a pseudocoelom, a primitive body cavity. Only longitudinal muscles are present within nematodes, which are covered by a protective cuticle layer. Nerve chords relay stimuli from sensory organs such as amphids, phasmids, cephalic papillae, and caudal papillae. M. bicornis differs from other nematodes in that it possess an extended oesophageal cavity, a ventral pre-anal sucker, and an unusual number of caudal papillae (12 total, 1 lone). The cephalic extremity is also made up of three lips and lamella-like formations. The combination of these features taxonomically place the organism into the family Kathlaniidae.\n\nM. bicornis has the ability to extend or retract its cephalic region, though the specific function of this ability is unknown.

It is her memoir about growing up in a Dalit family. In the book, she describes how she felt compelled to hide her caste and pretended to be of another caste, all along terrified of her true identity being found out. Her decision to end the pretense of being an upper caste woman was triggered by a University of Hyderabad Dalit student Rohith Vemula's last letter, which was made public following his suicide.

It is in the district of Chacarita in the northern part of Buenos Aires, adjacent to La Chacarita Cemetery.\n\nHistory of the cemetery\n\nThe British Cemetery was inaugurated in April 1821; the first President of Argentina, Bernardino Rivadavia, approved the project on 19 March 1821 and the purchase of the land. The first address was Calle Juncal (Juncal Street) today number 866, beside the building that houses Socorro Church. The first burial took place a few days after 19 March 1821 when it was still an open paddock. This burial was of a 30 year old Englishman named John Adams, a carpenter by profession.\n\nIn 1833 the Cemetery was moved to Calle Victoria (Victoria Street), (today Calle Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen), between Pasco and Pichincha, until 1892. The site is today a plaza called \"1 de Mayo\".\n\nProtestant Cemetery of Victoria\nIn May 1827 the British consul Woodbine Parish started negotiations with the government to obtain permission for the British community to build a new temple and another plot for the cemetery, since the existing cemetery (at Socorro) was full.\n\nIn February 1829, the Rosas government made available a plot for the construction of the temple, but there were no funds for the donation of the land for the new cemetery. On 21 August 1832, the then British consul Griffiths reported that the British government would cover half of the expenses necessary for the new cemetery.\n\nIn 1833 Victoria Cemetery was opened in today's Plaza 1\u00b0 de Mayo, between Calle Hip\u00f3lito Yrigoyen (then Calle Victoria) and Pasco, Alsina and Pichincha Streets.\n\nThe new land, measuring 100m x 100m, was acquired from Manuel La Serna and Maria Luisa Roseti for $4,500. The land was more expensive than expected, and the estimated budget was insufficient to finish the project. In March, 1833 the Buenos Aires English language newspaper, The British Packet,  reported that the subscriptions were not sufficient so more contributions were requested from the community.\n\nWhen on 7 June 1833 the purchase of the land was concluded it was agreed that it was exclusively for Protestants of the city.\n\nVictoria Cemetery received its first two British burials on 6 November 1833.\n\nThe plots were freely transferable, but no trees could be planted; no tablets or monuments against the walls or common space were allowed.  Carriages, wagons, horses or cattle were not allowed to enter. The gravedigger would take record and deliver a copy to the British chaplain for the official record.\n\nVictoria Cemetery remained open for almost sixty years, with a temporary closure in two occasions: during Hilario Lagos's siege in 1853, and during the yellow fever outbreak in 1871, when the government prohibited burial in urban cemeteries.\n\nAs the city around the cemetery was growing, the neighbors wanted the cemetery moved further away.  In 1869 the Municipality notified the cemetery that they had to go elsewhere, so they initiated negotiations, which dragged on for more than twenty years.\n\nThe last burial at Victoria Cemetery dates back to November, 1892. Some remains, monuments and headstones, were moved to the new cemetery, work that finished around 1923. The old Cemetery became the Plaza \"1\u00b0 de Mayo\" where a commemorative plaque remains. Some say that the remains of Elizabeth Chitty, wife of Admiral William (Guillermo) Brown, are still under this plaza.\n\nAt La Chacarita \nSection 16 of the Chacarita Cemetery was given in exchange for the Victoria Cemetery. The British Cemetery finally opened its doors at its current address in Chacarita on Sunday, 13 November 1892.\n\nIn 1913 the British Cemetery was divided into the German and the British Cemeteries as we know them today, because the two local communities had grown since the beginning of the 19th century.\n\nWar memorial and graves\nThe cemetery contains the war graves of one Royal Navy seaman of World War I and eleven British service personnel of World War II, comprising six from the Royal Navy and three of the Merchant Navy, besides one each from the Royal Artillery, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force.\n\nOn 16 November 2016 a war memorial, with the names of the 866 volunteers from Argentina who died in World War I and World War II engraved in the granite, was unveiled with the presence of Ambassadors; Defence Attach\u00e9s; Argentine Military, the Buenos Aires Scottish Guard; the Honour Guard of the Argentine Air Force; the band from the Argentine Military School and over 300 members of the public and members of the Argentine British Community. The religious service was conducted by Archbishop Gregory Venabales, Primate of the Anglican Church in South America and Rev. Douglas Robertson of the Presbyterian church.\n\nBritish Garden Cemetery in Pablo Nogu\u00e9s \nThe British Garden Cemetery in Pablo Nogu\u00e9s was inaugurated in July 1971.\n\nThe British Garden Cemetery is considered the first garden style in the country and it is situated in Ingeniero Pablo Nogu\u00e9s in the Province of Buenos Aires, about 30\u00a0km north of the City of Buenos Aires.\n\nManagement \nThe British Cemetery Corporation of Buenos Aires is managed by an Honorary Committee and its goal is to serve the community.\n\nNotable burials \n\n Vasily (Wilhelm) Baumgarten

It is a semi-crystalline fluoropolymer (a partially fluorinated polymer) designed to provide chemical resistance in heavy-duty corrosion applications.\n\nPhysical and chemical properties\n\nECTFE is resistant to acids at high concentrations and temperatures, caustic media, oxidizing agents and many solvents. It has similar chemical resistance to PTFE. A chemical resistance table, based on immersion tests, has explored this further. Permeation of large molecules is slow in fluoropolymers and thus is not relevant in the final application. Small molecules, however, may permeate through the polymer matrix at a relevant time. In lining or coating applications, the permeation of certain small molecules determines the lifetime of anti-corrosion protection. H2O, O2, Cl2, H2S, HCl, HF, HBr, N2, H2, CH3OH, etc. are relatively mobile in a polymer matrix and lead to measurable effects. Permeation resistance is significant for lining and coating applications, because permeating species may attack underlying mechanical layers, such as fiber reinforced plastic or steel. This high permeation resistance to small molecules is a consequence of the free volume occupied by the chlorine atom in the polymer chain.\n\nECTFE has a continuous usage temperature range between typically \u201376\u00a0\u00b0C and +150\u00a0\u00b0C (\u2013105F to +300F). It has good impact resistance and Young's modulus in the range of 1700 MPa, allowing for self-standing items and pressure piping systems. ECTFE maintains high impact strength in cryogenic applications.\n\nIn terms of fire resistance, ECTFE shows a limiting oxygen index of 52%. This is between the fully fluorinated polymers PTFE, PFA and FEP with a limiting oxygen index of 95% and other partially fluorinated polymers like PVDF with a limiting oxygen index of 44% and ETFE with a limiting oxygen index of 30%.\n\nECTFE is an electrical insulator, with high resistivity and a low dielectric constant as well as a low dissipation factor, allowing its use for wire and cable primary and secondary jacketing.\nSimilar to other fluoropolymers, ECTFE has good UV resistance, in particular against UV-A and UV-B. ECTFE films can be transparent.\n\nECTFE is welded in a variety of methods, including:\n Butt welding\n Infrared welding\n High frequency welding\n Hot gas welding\n Ultrasonic welding\n\nApplications\nECTFE is applied in several ways:\n By electrostatic powder coating on metal surfaces\n By rotolining on metal surfaces rotolining grade Halar 6012F\n By sheet lining on metal surface or on fiber reinforced plastic FRP (glass fiber, carbon fiber, ...).\n By extrusion or injection molding of self standing items, in particular pressure pipes\n By rotomolding of self standing items like tanks or other shapes (rotomolding grade)\n As a protective film using an adequate adhesive\n\nECTFE powder is most commonly used in electrostatic powder coating. ECTFE powder coatings have a typical thickness of 0,8\u00a0mm but can be applied up to 2\u00a0mm with a special grade for high build up.\n\nExtrusion of ECTFE fabric-backed sheets and subsequent fabrication to vessels, pipes or valves is used in the chemical industry. Thick sheets are compression molded and can go up to 50\u00a0mm in thickness. They are used in the semiconductor industry for wet benches or machining other parts.\n\nThe most common application of ECTFE is in the field of corrosion protection. ECTFE is used for corrosion protection in industries including:\n Bleaching towers in pulp and paper\n Sulfuric acid production and storage\n Flue gas treatment in particular in the SNOX and WSA process\n Electrolysis collectors or drying towers in the chlorine industry\n Transport vessels for hazardous goods, in particular class 8\n Halogen related industry (bromine, chlorine, fluorine)\n Acid handling (sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, hydrogen halides, hydrogen sulfide, etc.)\n Mining applications, in particular high pressure heap leach\n\nECTFE has been widely used in the semiconductor industry, for wet tool and tubing systems for lithographic chemicals.\n\nECTFE is also used in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\nMoreover, ECTFE is used for primary and secondary jacketing in specialty cables like data cables or self-regulating heating cables, applications where good fire resistance and electrical properties are key properties. ECTFE is also used for braiding in that field.\n\nECTFE in the form of a monofilament fiber is used in flue gas treatment and in certain chemical processes.\n\nUnlike PTFE, ECTFE can be crimped which allows its production in the form of nonwoven fibers with high surface area and porosity. Even though such material has low chemical reactivity, ECTFE in general has somewhat lower chemical resistance comparing to PTFE.\n\nHalar films are used in the aircraft industry as well as for photovoltaic front and back sheets.\n\nECTFE is used for manufacturing gaskets to store liquid oxygen and other propellants for aerospace applications.\n\nSee also\n bs4994 ECTFE as a thermoplastic lining for dual laminate chemical process plant equipment's\n RTP-1 ECTFE as a thermoplastic lining for dual laminate ASME stamped vessels.\n\nReferences\n\nPlastics\nFluoropolymers\nCopolymers\nThermoplastics", "We Do What We Want \u043f'\u044f\u0442\u0438\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0443\u0434\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0457 \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442-\u0445\u0430\u0440\u0434\u043a\u043e\u0440-\u0433\u0440\u0443\u043f\u0438 Emery. \u0410\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u0432\u0438\u043f\u0443\u0449\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 29 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0437\u043d\u044f 2011 \u043f\u0456\u0434 \u0434\u0432\u043e\u043c\u0430 \u043b\u0435\u0431\u0430\u043c\u0438 Tooth & Nail Records \u0442\u0430 Solid State Records.\n\n\u0422\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442 \n The Cheval Glass (3:16)\n Scissors (3:14)\n The Anchors (3:48)\n The Curse of Perfect Days (4:27)\n You Wanted It (4:16)\n I'm Not Here for Rage I'm Here for Revenge (3:53)\n Daddy's Little Peach (4:02)\n Addicted to Bad Decisions (4:17)\n I Never Got to See the West Coast (4:40)\n Fix Me (3:56)\n\n\u0414\u0436\u0435\u0440\u0435\u043b\u0430 \nWe Do What We Want \n\n\u0410\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0438 Emery\n\u0410\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0438 \u0430\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0432\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0432\u0446\u0456\u0432\n\u0410\u043d\u0433\u043b\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0456 \u043c\u0443\u0437\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0456 \u0430\u043b\u044c\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0438", "Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) also called Decentralized Artificial Intelligence is a subfield of artificial intelligence research dedicated to the development of distributed solutions for problems. DAI is closely related to and a predecessor of the field of multi-agent systems.\n\nDefinition\nDistributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is an approach to solving complex learning, planning, and decision making problems. It is embarrassingly parallel, thus able to exploit large scale computation and spatial distribution of computing resources. These properties allow it to solve problems that require the processing of very large data sets. DAI systems consist of autonomous learning processing nodes (agents), that are distributed, often at a very large scale. DAI nodes can act independently and partial solutions are integrated by communication between nodes, often asynchronously. By virtue of their scale, DAI systems are robust and elastic, and by necessity, loosely coupled. Furthermore, DAI systems are built to be adaptive to changes in the problem definition or underlying data sets due to the scale and difficulty in redeployment.\n\nDAI systems do not require all the relevant data to be aggregated in a single location, in contrast to monolithic or centralized Artificial Intelligence systems which have tightly coupled and geographically close processing nodes. Therefore, DAI systems often operate on sub-samples or hashed impressions of very large datasets. In addition, the source dataset may change or be updated during the course of the execution of a DAI system.\n\nGoals\nThe objectives of Distributed Artificial Intelligence are to solve the reasoning, planning, learning and perception problems of artificial intelligence, especially if they require large data, by distributing the problem to autonomous processing nodes (agents). To reach the objective, DAI requires:\n A distributed system with robust and elastic computation on unreliable and failing resources that are loosely coupled\n Coordination of the actions and communication of the nodes\n Subsamples of large data sets and online machine learning\n\nThere are many reasons for wanting to distribute intelligence or cope with multi-agent systems. Mainstream problems in DAI research include the following:\n Parallel problem solving: mainly deals with how classic artificial intelligence concepts can be modified, so that multiprocessor systems and clusters of computers can be used to speed up calculation.\n Distributed problem solving (DPS): the concept of agent, autonomous entities that can communicate with each other, was developed to serve as an abstraction for developing DPS systems. See below for further details.\n Multi-Agent Based Simulation (MABS): a branch of DAI that builds the foundation for simulations that need to analyze not only phenomena at macro level but also at micro level, as it is in many social simulation scenarios.\n\nHistory\nIn 1975 distributed artificial intelligence emerged as a subfield of artificial intelligence that dealt with interactions of intelligent agents[2]. Distributed artificial intelligence systems were conceived as a group of intelligent entities, called agents, that interacted by cooperation, by coexistence or by competition. DAI is categorized into Multi-agent systems and distributed problem solving [1]. In Multi-agent systems the main focus is how agents coordinate their knowledge and activities. For distributed problem solving the major focus is how the problem is decomposed and the solutions are synthesized.\n\nExamples\nMulti-agent systems and distributed problem solving are the two main DAI approaches. There are numerous applications and tools.\n\nApproaches\nTwo types of DAI has emerged: \n In Multi-agent systems agents coordinate their knowledge and activities and reason about the processes of coordination. Agents are physical or virtual entities that can act, perceive its environment and communicate with other agents. The agent is autonomous and has skills to achieve goals. The agents change the state of their environment by their actions. There are a number of different coordination techniques[3].\n In distributed problem solving the work is divided among nodes and the knowledge is shared. The main concerns are task decomposition and synthesis of the knowledge and solutions.\n\nDAI can apply a bottom-up approach to AI, similar to the subsumption architecture as well as the traditional top-down\napproach of AI. In addition, DAI can also be a vehicle for emergence.\n\nApplications\nAreas where DAI have been applied are:\n Electronic commerce, e.g. for trading strategies the DAI system learns financial trading rules from subsamples of very large samples of financial data\n Networks, e.g. in telecommunications the DAI system controls the cooperative resources in a WLAN network http://dair.uncc.edu/projects/past-projects/wlan-resource\n Routing, e.g. model vehicle flow in transport networks\n Scheduling, e.g. flow shop scheduling where the resource management entity ensures local optimization and cooperation for global and local consistency\n Multi-Agent systems, e.g. artificial life, the study of simulated life\n Electric power systems, e.g. COndition Monitoring Multi-Agent System (COMMAS) applied to transformer condition monitoring, and IntelliTEAM II Automatic Restoration System\n\nTools\n ECStar, a distributed rule-based learning system\n\nAgents and Multi-agent systems\n\nNotion of Agents: Agents can be described as distinct entities with standard boundaries and interfaces designed for problem solving.\n\nNotion of Multi-Agents:Multi-Agent system is defined as a network of agents which are loosely coupled working as a single entity like society for problem solving that an individual agent cannot solve.\n\nSoftware agents\nThe key concept used in DPS and MABS is the abstraction called software agents. An agent is a virtual (or physical) autonomous entity that has an understanding of its environment and acts upon it. An agent is usually able to communicate with other agents in the same system to achieve a common goal, that one agent alone could not achieve. This communication system uses an agent communication language.\n\nA first classification that is useful is to divide agents into:\n reactive agent \u2013 A reactive agent is not much more than an automaton that receives input, processes it and produces an output.\n deliberative agent \u2013 A deliberative agent in contrast should have an internal view of its environment and is able to follow its own plans.\n hybrid agent \u2013 A hybrid agent is a mixture of reactive and deliberative, that follows its own plans, but also sometimes directly reacts to external events without deliberation.\n\nWell-recognized agent architectures that describe how an agent is internally structured are:\n ASMO (emergence of distributed modules)\n BDI (Believe Desire Intention, a general architecture that describes how plans are made)\n InterRAP (A three-layer architecture, with a reactive, a deliberative and a social layer)\n PECS (Physics, Emotion, Cognition, Social, describes how those four parts influences the agents behavior).\n Soar (a rule-based approach)\n\nChallenges\nThe challenges in Distributed AI are:\n\n1.How to carry out communication and interaction of agents and which communication language or protocols should be used.\n\n2.How to ensure the coherency of agents.\n\n3.How to synthesise the results among 'intelligent agents' group by formulation, description, decomposition and allocation.\n\nSee also\n\nReferences \n\n A.

As of the 2020 census, the population of the city was 50.  The name Elsmore is a corruption of Elsinore, where Shakespeare's play Hamlet was set.\n\nHistory\nThe old town of Elsmore, which for several years was the center of attraction for the citizens of Elsmore Township, was located farther west, not far from Big Creek.  On August 25, 1888, after the route of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas R.R. from Kansas City to Parsons had been definitely settled, N.L. Ard, J.L. Roberts, J.A. Nicholson, W.D. and H.W. Cox, and O.P. Mattson purchased  where the present town of Elsmore stands, and platted the town.  It soon became a popular trading center and shipping point for that section of the county, and in 1909 was incorporated.  In 1910 it reported a population of 216 and had a money order post office (first opened in November 1866) with two rural delivery routes, a bank, several good stores, some small manufacturing enterprises, telegraph and express facilities.\n\nGeography\nElsmore is located at  (37.794222, -95.149458), in Section 7, Township 26 south, Range 21 east.  Elsmore is situated in the southeastern part of the county in Elsmore Township, some  southeast of the city of Iola (the county seat). U.S. Route 59 passes west of the city, and K-203 is a short connector (less than a mile) between US-59 and the city.  The small city of Savonburg lies about  to the south, and the larger city of Moran is about nine miles (14\u00a0km) to the north (along US-59).\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.\n\nDemographics\n\n2010 census\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 77 people, 35 households, and 22 families residing in the city.

Van der Graaf shot Fortuyn outside a radio studio in Hilversum shortly after Fortuyn gave an interview during the political campaign for the Dutch general election of 2002. An environmental and animal rights activist, van der Graaf stated at his trial that he killed Fortuyn to stop him from exploiting Muslims as \"scapegoats\" and targeting \"the vulnerable sections of society\" in seeking political power. Graaf was arrested shortly after shooting Fortuyn, who died immediately. In court, van der Graaf testified that he had become alarmed that Fortuyn was using Muslims and immigrants as scapegoats in a campaign to seek political power. He thought the politician endangered society with his controversial statements. His trial started on 27 March 2003. He was convicted on 15 April 2003 and sentenced to 18 years in prison. The trial generated large interest from the Dutch public, especially from supporters of Fortuyn. Some Fortuyn supporters and political commentators argued that the political left and the media had created a climate that had enabled Graaf's actions through demonising Fortuyn. After his conviction, Graaf appealed for the reduction of the sentence to 16 years, but on 18 July 2003, the appeals court upheld the previous sentence. He was released on parole in May 2014 after serving 12 years, two-thirds of his sentence, according to Dutch practice. His parole ultimately expired on 30 April 2020, giving release from the remaining restrictions.\n\nFamily life and education\nVan der Graaf was born in Middelburg, in the province of Zeeland. By the time he attended university in Wageningen, he had become a vegan and an advocate of animal rights. At the time of the murder he lived with his girlfriend and their infant daughter in Harderwijk.\n\nCareer\nVan der Graaf worked for the environmental organisation Vereniging Milieu Offensief in Wageningen, which he had co-founded in 1992. His job involved challenging violators of environmental regulations through litigation. He concentrated particularly on contesting practices in intensive animal farming and fur farming. He was said to be highly motivated, working more than the four days per week of his contract. He was successful at litigation, winning about three out of every four cases.\n\nMurder of Fortuyn\n\nOn 6 May 2002, Pim Fortuyn was shot outside a radio studio in Hilversum at 6:00\u00a0pm, just after he finished an interview. He was killed instantly. Interviewer Ruud de Wild witnessed the murder.\n\nVan der Graaf was arrested near the scene of the crime after a pursuit by witnesses. Details of the suspect were always officially reported as \"Volkert van der G.\", in accordance with unwritten Dutch privacy practice, but his full name was readily available on the internet. His home and work addresses were soon circulated on web sites used by Fortuyn's supporters. Angry supporters gathered in several cities, so several people related to Van der Graaf went into hiding. His girlfriend and their daughter left their house on the evening of the murder.\n\nThe details of the murder emerged later; the accounts of the investigators and Van der Graaf were consistent. He had planned the attack using information obtained from the Internet; printouts of a map of the scene of the crime and schedules of Fortuyn's appearances were found in his car. In two boxes of cartridges found at his home, seven cartridges were missing, the exact number loaded in his gun. The attack has been described as the work of a single person, an amateur shooter who used a relatively simple plan and did not prepare a good escape route.\n\nVan der Graaf purchased his weapons illegally: a semi-automatic Star Firestar M43 pistol in a caf\u00e9 in Ede and 9mm cartridges in The Hague. After the murder of Fortuyn, the gun was linked to a suspect in the robbery of a jeweller in Emmen through DNA material found on the weapon.\n\nOn the day of the murder, he attended work in the morning, taking with him a backpack containing the gun, a pair of latex gloves, a baseball cap and a pair of dark glasses. At the end of the morning, he said he was taking the afternoon off on account of the beautiful weather. He drove towards Hilversum, knowing that Fortuyn was due to be interviewed in the radio studio of 3FM in the Media Park. During the trip he stopped several times, among other things to purchase a razor to remove his stubble, which together with the cap and glasses would disguise his appearance, while the gloves would avoid leaving fingerprints. The razor did not work.\n\nHe had never visited the Mediapark, relying on a map and a couple of photos to find his way into the park on foot and to the building where Fortuyn's interview was held. Recognising Fortuyn's car in the car park, he hid in some nearby bushes, burying the gun which was in a plastic bag in a shallow trough in case he was discovered. He could hear fragments of Fortuyn's interview from a speaker on the outside of the building. He waited there for about two hours.\n \nFortuyn emerged from the building in the company of several others, including De Wild. Van der Graaf walked towards Fortuyn, passed by him, then turned and opened fire. He said that he aimed for the back to avoid Fortuyn's ducking away or a bullet mistakenly hitting somebody else. He held the gun in both hands, with the plastic bag around it. Less than  from Fortuyn, he hit him in the back and head five times, and fired a sixth shot that missed.\n\nRunning away, Van der Graaf was chased by Hans Smolders, Fortuyn's chauffeur. Two employees from a different building joined in. During the chase, Van der Graaf threatened them by raising the gun in his jacket pocket toward them. They ran from the grounds of the Mediapark onto a public road, where Van der Graaf pointed the pistol at arm's length at Smolders, who had been reporting their position to the police by mobile phone. Reaching a gas station, Van der Graaf gave himself up when police pointed their pistols at him.\n\nInvestigations and trial\n\nInitial investigations and conspiracy theories \nFor several months Van der Graaf refused to make any statement about the murder, on the advice of his lawyers. He was represented by B\u00f6hler, Koppe and Franken, with B\u00f6hler leading.\n\nIn the months following the murder, many conspiracy theories were put forth by supporters of Fortuyn and others. Officials investigating the murder dismissed these popular rumours, declaring that no evidence had been found for the involvement of others. No evidence was found to support rumors that Van der Graaf had committed the earlier murder in 1996 of Chris van der Werken, an environmental official from Nunspeet, or that he attended other appearances by Fortuyn.\n\nOn 7 July 2006, the national daily newspaper De Telegraaf published an article alleging Van der Graaf's connection with the murder of Van der Werken. De Telegraaf printed extracts of a secret police report on the murder of Van der Werken on its website. Quirijn Meijnen, a Dutch-based media lawyer who represented Van der Graaf, said the accusations were grave and unfounded, and that the publication of extracts of the secret police report infringed Van der Graaf's privacy rights. De Telegraaf failed to mention that Van der Graaf was never a suspect in the murder case of Van der Werken.\n\nAfter Van der Graaf's arrest, he was held in strict isolation until 1 June. He could speak only to his lawyers and police and justice officials. He was kept under constant observation by video camera.\n\nA second search of Van der Graaf's home on 24 June found a chemical mixture, calcium chlorate and sugar, hidden in 35 condoms in his garage. Nearby were flasks of sulphuric acid. Experts said the substances could be combined to make a fire bomb or explosive material. Van der Graaf later said that he had fabricated the materials around 1990\u20131992 for experimentation purposes and had forgotten about them. Detectives also conducted a search on Graaf's personal computer and found he had used the internet to gather information about Fortuyn.\n\nFirst hearing \nThe first \"pro forma\" hearing in his trial started on 9 August, which Van der Graaf watched on television from his cell in the Bijlmerbajes prison. The prosecution outlined its evidence, which included the finding of DNA matching Fortuyn on Van der Graaf's clothes and gun, matching of the bullets used in the attack with the gun, and eyewitnesses who pursued him continuously from the murder scene to the point of arrest. The defence complained that lack of discretion in reporting by the press and statements by public officials would make it difficult to obtain a fair trial. It requested calling as witnesses several politicians who had made public comments about the murder, including the past Prime Ministers Wim Kok and Jan Peter Balkenende, as well as various members of Lijst Pim Fortuyn including Mat Herben and Jim Janssen van Raaij.\n\nOn the morning of 3 September, Van der Graaf's girlfriend was arrested at her workplace in connection with the chemicals found at their former home. Her lawyer and the lawyers of Van der Graaf denounced this as an attempt to pressure Van der Graaf into making a statement. She was released two days later and eventually cleared of any suspicion after Van der Graaf made a statement on her behalf.\n\nSecond hearing \nDuring a second \"pro forma\" hearing on 4 November, it was decided that the trial would be delayed while Van der Graaf was sent for seven weeks of psychiatric observation at the Pieter Baan Centre, starting in the first week of January 2003. In a press statement of 23 November, the prosecution (Public Ministry) announced that Van der Graaf had confessed to the murder. He said he planned it for some time and that nobody else was involved in the plans or knew about them. He believed Fortuyn was a steadily increasing danger for vulnerable groups in society. He saw no other possibility than to end the danger by killing Fortuyn.\n\nIn response to the confession, Mat Herben said he was still not convinced that Van der Graaf had acted alone. Fortuyn's brother Marten said he was not surprised by the confession but feared that Van der Graaf was setting himself up as \"saviour of the fatherland\".\n\nThe confession has not been made publicly available. Reports have asserted that Van der Graaf said he was \"not proud\" of the deed. He said if he could consider the decision again, he would not do it. He said that he did not see himself as \"the saviour of the Netherlands\" or as a martyr.\n\nOn 6 January 2003, Van der Graaf was moved to the Pieter Baan Centrum (PBC) to begin the seven-week behavioural investigation. Disagreements between the Ministry of Justice and the management of the PBC over the conditions of his supervision delayed it. The Ministry wanted Van der Graaf under video surveillance 24 hours per day and isolated from other patients for his own safety. The PBC believed such cameras would prevent establishing the trust needed for the multi-disciplinary behavioural investigation. It took responsibility to supervise him in a small group so that the investigation could proceed optimally. On 20 January, Van der Graaf said he was suspending his cooperation for the investigation. The Minister of Justice, Piet Hein Donner, resolved the dispute by dropping the demands for video surveillance and isolation.\n\nThird hearing \nOn January, 29th, 2003 a third \"pro forma\" hearing was held in which the dates for the trial were set. Since the subject of the trial was expected to be not so much the question of the guilt of Van der Graaf, but instead the degree of the punishment, the report of the Pieter Baan Centrum was considered highly significant, in case it found that he was of \"diminished responsibilities\". After the completion of the investigation on 14 March, he was returned to his prison cell in the Bijlmerbajes.\n\nThe report from the PBC was complete by about 21 March. It found that Van der Graaf could be held completely accountable for the killing. The report also stated that Van der Graaf has a severe personality disorder, which explains his rigid moral judgements. Menno Oosterhoff, a child psychiatrist from Groningen, publicly suggested that the Pieter Baan Centrum may have overlooked the possibility that Van der Graaf has Asperger syndrome; Oosterhoff later withdrew his theory. The PBC report stated that nothing could be said about the chance of another similar crime occurring, since the disorder had nothing to do with the murder. Van der Graaf agreed that he was accountable and that he had compulsive urges. The outcome of the investigation ensured that he would receive a prison sentence and not \"TBS treatment\".\n\nThe trial \n\nThe trial was held in a high-security court in Amsterdam-Osdorp over three days: 27 March, 31 March, and 1 April. About 15 supporters of Fortuyn demonstrated outside the building, with banners such as \"for less than 20 years we will smash the place up\", \"better Fortuynist than socialist\" and \"the leftist church is criminal\". The proceedings were followed by about 80 people, including a woman who disturbed the occasion by screaming at Van der Graaf, accusing him of such things as \"destroying the whole of the Netherlands\". Van der Graaf was counseled by the high-profile German-born attorney, Britta B\u00f6hler.\n\nVan der Graaf was charged with the premeditated murder of Fortuyn, two counts of possession of illegal weapons, namely the gun and the explosive mixture at his house, and a charge of threatening the life of Fortuyn's chauffeur by pointing his gun at him during the chase following the murder.\n\nThe prosecutor asked for life imprisonment for the killing, saying that an example must be set for anybody else attempting to frustrate the democratic process through criminal means. He said the crime was serious because of its victim and the consequences, and that to a certain degree it was a \"political murder\". Van der Graaf had irrevocably damaged the democratic political progress of Fortuyn, and had done it intentionally. For an exceptional crime, he deserved an exceptional punishment.\n\nDuring the trial, Van der Graaf described his reasons for killing Fortuyn. He claimed he hoped that the leaders of other political parties would criticize Fortuyn, but that it never happened (which was not true as other party leaders had openly criticized and derided Fortuyn in debates). He claimed that Fortuyn had the talent to channel criticism so that it never touched him. Van der Graaf said he had spoken to no one about his plan. He finished his planning just the day before the murder. Perhaps looking for sympathy, he said he was wrestling with regret for the killing, finding the killing of somebody morally reprehensible. On 6 May he had felt justified, saying that he wanted to fight the danger of what Fortuyn represented, not the man. He did not find it easy to talk about feelings. Asked about the danger of accidentally injuring somebody other than Fortuyn in the attack, he said that he had been confident that that would not happen. However, the 3FM disc jockey Ruud de Wild said that he barely escaped with his life, as he received a bullet in the bag used for a shield. De Wild also stated that witnessing the shooting had left him from suffering PTSD.\n\nTo the argument that Fortuyn would have been chosen through democratic means, Van der Graaf said that that was also the case for Hitler. He compared the rise of Fortuyn to the rise of Nazism in the 1930s. In his final argument, he said that he had acted from his conscience, but that did not justify murder. He said it was absolutely not normal to shoot somebody to death.\n\nVan der Graaf said he murdered Fortuyn to defend Dutch Muslims from persecution. He wanted to stop Fortuyn from targeting \"the weak parts of society to score points\" and exploiting Muslims as \"scapegoats\" in an attempt to seek political power.\n\nVan der Graaf said that he would not have committed the murder, at least not on that evening, if Fortuyn had been accompanied by security guards; this is relevant to accusations that the government should have provided security. On Tuesday, 15 April 2003, Van der Graaf was convicted and sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment.\n\nAppeals \nThe prosecution and the defence both made appeals against the sentence. Prior to the appeal, suggestions in the media that Van der Graaf may have had Asperger syndrome were rejected by workers at the PBC. They said they had considered and rejected the possibility. A psychiatric report read in court said that Van der Graaf had an obsessive compulsive personality but was sane and could be held accountable for his actions. The prosecution argued that the court had not taken account of the political nature of the murder, and asked again for life imprisonment. The defence argued that the sentence did not take account of the harsh conditions under which Van der Graaf had been held, nor the damage that had been done by unsubstantiated allegations that had appeared in the media (such as the connection with Van der Werken), and requested a reduction in sentence to 16 years. The appeals court accepted some of the arguments from both parties, and on 18 July 2003 reiterated the sentence to 18 years' imprisonment.\n\nRelease \n\nVan der Graaf was released on parole on 2 May 2014, after having served two-thirds of his sentence as required by Dutch law. The conditions of his parole were: weekly reporting to the probation service; a ban on visiting the places of residence of relatives of the victim or the municipal areas of Rotterdam, Hilversum and The Hague; location monitoring with an ankle bracelet with GPS; a ban on contacting the relatives of Fortuyn; a ban on communicating with the media; and compulsory meetings with a psychologist or psychiatrist. He subsequently settled in Apeldoorn. A  public protest against Van der Graaf's release was organised in Rotterdam by former LPF politicians including Hans Smolders and members of Fortuyn's family.\n\nIn July 2014, his lawyer Stijn Franken started legal proceedings against the terms of the parole. Van der Graaf was interested in becoming a legal advisor, and the restriction on visiting The Hague was unreasonable when so many legal organisations are based there. He also claimed that the restriction on communicating with the press was a violation of free speech, and that this and other restrictions were unnecessary when experts had found the risk of recidivism to be extremely low. He was partially successful, in that the travel restrictions and the ankle bracelet conditions were removed, but the media ban remained to \"prevent unnecessary social unrest\". The government appealed the judgement, but it was upheld.\n\nIn 2017, Van der Graaf faced another court case in which the public prosecutor asked that he be returned to prison for a year for failing to sufficiently answer questions at probation meetings. However, on 6 February 2017 the court found that he had sufficiently met his probation requirements by appearing at the meetings.\n\nIn 2018, Van der Graaf again took legal action against the government over the terms of his parole, saying that the parole hearings prevented him from emigrating. The court ruled in his favour, and an appeal was withdrawn after a new arrangement was made: that Van der Graaf would report by email once every two months, until April 2020. As of May 2019, he was still resident in Apeldoorn.\n\nHis parole expired on 30 April 2020, giving release from the remaining restrictions.\n\nSee also\n Left-wing terrorism\n 06/05, a movie loosely based upon Pim Fortuyn's murder\n\nReferences\n\n1969 births\nLiving people\n21st-century Dutch criminals\nDutch animal rights activists\nDutch assassins\nDutch people convicted of murder\nPeople convicted of murder by the Netherlands\nPeople from Middelburg, Zeeland\nPeople with obsessive-compulsive personality disorder\nPrisoners and detainees of the Netherlands\nWageningen University and Research alumni", "Graco (pronounced gray-co) is an American baby products company based in High Point, North Carolina. It is owned and operated by Newell Brands. Graco offers products including car seats, travel systems, strollers, high chairs, play yards, and baby swings.\n\nHistory \nGraco was founded in 1942 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, by Russell Gray and Robert Cone (hence the name) as Graco Metal Products, a company that fabricated machine and car parts. Rex Thomas (one of two engineers hired to come up with a sustainable product) watched his wife sitting on the porch, rocking their baby in a swing with a string tied to it, while she read a book. Rex went into work the next day and said \"why don't we make an automatic baby swing.\" After 18 months of research and development, the Swyngomatic - the world's first wind-up, automatic baby swing was born in 1955, designed by company engineer Dave Saint. \n\nIn 1987, the company pioneered the invention of the Pack N' Play Portable Playard, the world's first portable play yard (designed by Nate Saint, Dave Saint's son).\n\nIn 1998, Rubbermaid acquired Century, a car seat manufacturer and introduced the SnugRide infant car seat, which has become America's top-selling infant car seat line. Century actually introduced the travel system where a car seat could fit on a stroller for easy transportation. That same year, Graco was acquired by Rubbermaid. A year later in 1999, the company was acquired by Newell Company and Newell became Newell Rubbermaid. \n\nIn 2016, Newell Rubbermaid changed its name to Newell Brands when they acquired Jarden. \n\nIn 2002, Graco launched the Turbo Booster, a booster seat designed to help parents stay in compliance with many states' passage of laws requiring children to stay in a car seat longer. In 2007, the company purchased established German baby product brand, Teutonia. The same year, the Nautilus 3-in-1 car seat debuted, earning the \"Best Bet\" designation from Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Then, in 2008, Graco acquired Aprica Kassai, the number one selling baby brand in Japan. In 2014, Newell Rubbermaid acquired American baby brand, Baby Jogger.\n\nIn 2021, Graco raised the minimum weight requirements for its boosters after a scathing Propublica report and Congressional subcommittee investigation.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nInfant products companies\nManufacturing companies established in 1942\nBabycare\nInfancy\nBaby products\n1942 establishments in Pennsylvania\nManufacturing companies based in North Carolina", "Mount Hampden is a village in Mashonaland West Province, Zimbabwe.

Tire irons have not been in common use for automobile tires since the shift to the use of tubeless tires in the late 1950s.\n\nBicycle tire irons are still in use for those tires which have a separate inner tube, and can have a hooked C-shape cut into one end of the iron so that it may be hooked on a bicycle spoke to hold it in place.\n\nDescription and use \n\nTire irons, which usually come in pairs or threes, are used to pry the edge of a tire away from the rim of the wheel it has been mounted on. After one iron has pried a portion of the tire from its wheel, it is held in position while a second iron is applied further along the tire to pry more of the tire away from the wheel. This allows enough of the tire to be separated so that the first iron can be removed, and used again on the far side of the other iron. Alternating in this way, a person can work all the way around the tire to fully remove it from the wheel, in order to reach the tube that sits inside.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, they became a colloquial term of strength, as in \"I couldn't get rid of him with a pair of tire irons,\" and frequently appeared in cartoons in similar situations. The usage is now considered pass\u00e9.\n\nBicycle tire irons \n\nTire irons for bicycles are usually referred to as \"tire levers\", as they are often made of plastic, not metal.\n\nTire levers for bicycle tires have one end that is tapered and slightly curved. The other end is usually hooked so that it can be hooked around a spoke to keep the tire bead free of the rim at one point, allowing a second lever to be manipulated forward, progressively loosening a larger segment of the tire bead from the rim.\n\nA common feature of tire levers is the lack of sharp edges. The slightest pinch of an inner tube by a lever can weaken or puncture the tube. It is good practice to examine a set of tire levers for any sharp edges and to file them smooth and round. \n\nClassically, tire levers were made of metal. However plastic ones are now manufactured which are even less sharp and less likely to puncture the tube. There are also some single-lever varieties, which can be inserted under the bead at one point then quickly pushed around the rim to pop the bead off.\n\nTire levers are not necessary or desirable in all cases. In some cases, the tire can be reinserted on the rim, and sometimes removed from the rim, without the use of tire levers. This reduces the chance of puncture caused by pinching the tube between the rim and the tire bead. Sometimes they are used to fit the tire back on, but this can be done without the levers.\n\nSee also \n Lug wrench\n Bead breaker\n Crowbar\n\nReferences \n\nBicycle tools\nTires\nMechanical hand tools", "Earl of Halifax is a title that has been created four times in British history\u2014once in the Peerage of England, twice in the Peerage of Great Britain, and once in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The name of the peerage refers to Halifax, West Yorkshire.\n\nThe first and fourth creations were elevations for the holders of the first and second creations of the title Viscount Halifax.  The holder of the first creation was later granted the title Marquess of Halifax. The second and third creations were for closely related male members of the Montagu family, landed gentry since the Norman Conquest, and spanned most of the years 1689\u20131771.\n\nThe fourth creation was in 1944 for Lord Halifax, the former viceroy of India (who was the 3rd Viscount Halifax before his elevation to the earldom). He was a prominent 1930s minister, to whom the office of prime minister was offered on the resignation of Chamberlain, which he declined in favour of Churchill.\n\nHistory of the title\n\n1679 creation\nThe first creation, in the Peerage of England in 1679, was for George Savile, 1st Viscount Halifax. He had already been made Baron Savile of Elland and Viscount Halifax in 1668, and was later made Marquess of Halifax (this creation of the earldom became extinct in 1700; see Marquess of Halifax for more information).\n\n1714 and 1715 creations\nThe title was recreated in 1714 for Charles Montagu, 1st Baron Halifax, First Lord of the Treasury to George I, along with the courtesy title of Viscount Sunbury. Both titles were created with remainder to heirs male. A member of the prominent Montagu family, he was the son of George Montagu, younger son of Henry Montagu, 1st Earl of Manchester (see the Duke of Manchester). Montagu had already been created Baron Halifax, of Halifax in the County of York, in 1700, with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his nephew George, son and heir of his brother Edward Montagu.\n\nOn Lord Halifax's death in 1715 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. He was succeeded in the barony according to the special remainder by his nephew George Montagu. Less than a month after his uncle's death, both titles were revived in his favour, making him Earl of Halifax and Viscount Sunbury. He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl, who was a prominent statesman. However, on his death in 1771 all the titles became extinct.\n\n1944 creation\nThe title was created for a fourth time in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1944 for Edward Wood, 3rd Viscount Halifax, the former Foreign Secretary and former Viceroy of India. The Wood family descends from Francis Wood, of Barnsley. His second son, Francis Wood, was created a baronet, of Barnsley in the County of York, in 1784, with remainder to his elder brother, the Reverend Henry Wood, and failing him to the sons of his younger brother, Charles Wood (who had died two years earlier). He was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Baronet (the son of Charles Wood).\n\nHis son, the third Baronet, was a prominent Liberal politician and served as Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1846 to 1852, during which he became notorious for the policies he followed during the Great Famine in Ireland. In 1866 he was created Viscount Halifax, of Monk Bretton in the West Riding of the County of York, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. His aforementioned grandson, the third Viscount, was also a noted politician. In 1925, nine years before he succeeded his father, he was himself raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Irwin, of Kirby Underdale in the County of York. In 1944 he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Halifax.  the titles are held by his grandson, the third Earl, who succeeded his father in 1980.\n\nAnother member of the Wood family was the Conservative politician Richard Wood, Baron Holderness.

A downrigger consists of a three to six-foot horizontal pole which supports a cannonball, generally 10 to 15 pounds, by a steel cable (generally stainless steel or wire).  A clip, also known as a \"release,\" attaches a fishing line to the cannonball weight. The bait or lure is attached to the release.\n\nOperation of a downrigger\nDownriggers consist of four major components, the weight, cable, pole or boom, and the spool.  A fishing line is attached to the downrigger cable by means of a \"line release.\"  The weight is normally a five-to-twenty-pound mass of lead which is connected to the stainless steel cable.  The spool is brought up either by a manual crank or via an electric motor.\n\nIn addition to attaching a lure to the fishing line, an oval piece of metal or plastic (often hammered or curved for reflective purposes) called a dodger or flasher is often used to attract fish from greater distances. The types of lures used to troll with using downriggers range from metal \"spoons\" that are often decorated using color tape or paint, plastic or rubber \"squids\", tinsel beaded flies, or painted plastic J-plugs. These all come in a variety of colors, finishes, and glow patterns for various fishing conditions.\n\nThe length of fishing line between the downrigger release and the lure is known as the \"lead\" and this varies in length depending on how far behind the boat the fisherman would like to lure to trail. This fishing line is typically between ten and twenty pound test. When fishing for salmon this lead is often quite lengthy in order to avoid the fish being frightened by the noise of the boat's trolling motor. When many boats are trolling in a small area this often results in crossed lines and tangles which are a detriment to the fishing experience.\n\nThe speed at which the lure is pulled through the water has a great impact on success or failure. For this reason fishermen use devices that accurately track speed. Typically, trolling from one to five knots is the range that allows for fish to be caught. This varies from species to species as Chinook Salmon may prefer higher speeds while the more docile Lake Trout may prefer a much slower-moving lure. Trolling motors are used to calibrate this speed more accurately than large outboard motors. Trolling plates may be used with larger motors to slow the boat to the desired speed, although some anglers experience mixed results using plates.\n\nThe downrigger should be set at the depth the target fish are schooling. Different species of fish school at different depths, and those depths also change at different times of year.  A fish finder is useful determining this depth.\n\nUsing a downrigger may be hazardous.  Many manmade reservoirs mask submerged trees and other structure beneath the surface.  A downrigger's weight may foul on such objects.  When such a snag occurs in conjunction with high winds, it may cause a lighter boat to capsize.  It is therefore prudent to carry wire cutters to avoid this potentially lethal scenario.\n\nBrief history\nUsing a downrigger began  in effort to increase productivity of fishing in larger bodies of water. Downriggers are used to troll and maintain the lure's depth in accordance with the thermocline at which the fish species being sought normally feeds. People began using downriggers first in  the Great Lakes area. They are now used all over the world to help catch a large variety of fish.\n\nIn the Great Lakes, downriggers are used to catch a variety of species including chinook salmon, atlantic salmon, lake trout, brown trout and steelhead.\n\nRecently discovery of an Edward vom Hofe late 1860s-1870s downrigger found local to Niagara Falls and the Salmon River area point to the reelmaker Edward Vom Hofe Brooklyn New York as the father of the modern downrigger. Prior it was thought that the great lakes Michigan anglers had invented the modern rig. However it was intended for the deep water basin fish listed above and most likely prior to the Hydroelectric plant being built on the Niagara River late 1870s. Somehow the device was lost in time due to the construction of the electric plant most likely causing a disruption in the Salmon fishing. Only one of these examples exist today. Not until the 1950s would a device similar to the Vom Hofe design reappear. It is possible that the modern downrigger introduced in the 1950s was copied from another Vom Hofe made device but for now that can not be proven due to the great time span in between the two designs. Edward vom Hofe was a premier tackle smith and reel maker.\n\nThere are two main classifications of downriggers today. There are manual downriggers, such as the Scotty Manual Downrigger. There are also electric downriggers such as the Scotty Electric Downrigger. A manual downrigger requires the user to crank the line to retrieve the weight. An electric downrigger utilizes an input screen and has automatic functions controlled by the user with the press of a button.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nHow To Fish Downriggers\nHow To Use A Downrigger\nOptimum Downrigger The Smart, Connected Electric Downrigger\n\nFishing equipment", "Fyshwick () is a retail and light industrial suburb of Canberra, Australia,  east of the South Canberra district. At the , Fyshwick had a population of 56.\n\nIt has many motor vehicle dealers, stores selling home furnishings and hardware, and stores that sell goods wholesale. Fyshwick also has the Canberra Outlet Centre and the Fyshwick Fresh Food Markets. There are also some caf\u00e9s and fast-food outlets.\n\nIt was named after Sir Philip Fysh, a Tasmanian politician who assisted in bringing about Australia's Federation. The suffix \"wick\", from Old English, means \"dwelling place\"and, by extension, \"village\" or \"district\". Its streets are named after Australia's industrial towns and regionsfor example, Mount Isa is represented by Isa Street and Townsville is represented by Townsville Street.\n\nFyshwick is also known for its adult entertainment industry. Fyshwick and Mitchell are the two places in the ACT where strip clubs and brothels may operate legally. Prostitution in the ACT was decriminalised in 1992, but strip clubs and brothels are restricted to those two suburbs. Fyshwick was also known for firework retailers before their 2009 ban from public purchase in the Australian Capital Territory.\n\nThe only railway line into Canberra runs through the middle of Fyshwick, dividing the area into halves. Ipswich and Newcastle Streets as well as the Monaro Highway cross the railway line, uniting both halves of Fyshwick.\n\nThe Fyshwick sewage treatment works was built in 1967 to treat waste water that could not easily be pumped to the other side of Canberra. It is now used to treat industrial waste water, which is then used to water the Duntroon grounds and golf course.\n\nHistory\n\nOne noteworthy portion of Fyshwick, located between the railway line and Canberra Avenue, was built as an internment camp during early 1918. It was known as the Molonglo Internment Camp, although it was also referred to as a concentration camp. The site was intended to accommodate 3,500 German and Austrian nationals being expelled from China, however once the camp had been established in May 1918 these internees were no longer destined for Molonglo. Instead, the camp housed 150 internees transferred from the Bourke Camp in New South Wales. The camp was closed in late 1919 after the internees were deported to Germany. Most of the camp's buildings were sold off, with the remaining buildings being converted to house construction workers, some of whom were unemployed returned servicemen. It was then called Molonglo Settlement. Gradually the camp buildings were moved to other camp sites around Canberra and the roads used to service the camp became the first streets of Fyshwick.\n\nThe internment camp's hospital at what is now Tennant Street became the Molonglo Public School. This school closed in 1942 and then became a naval auxiliary wireless station. This operated until 1946. The station consisted of one wooden T shaped building and a fibro mess hall. This station operated the receivers for the strategic fixed radio links to Australia for Whitehall, Halifax and Bombay Fort. During this period 14 WRANS operated the equipment. Marion Stevens was a Petty Officer in charge of the station from 1943 to 1946. She was notable as the only woman in charge of a transmitting station.\n\nThe station was part of the Harman radio network, as was connected via a landline to the main Harman site. Equipment at the Molonglo station included teleprinters for use when reception was good. During poorer radio propagation periods morse code radiotelegraphy had to be used.\n\nAfter the war the Molonglo station became a dog training school. In the early 1980s the buildings were demolished.\n\nGeology\n\nMost of the north of Fyshwick is underlain by Canberra Formation, calcareous shale.\nOn top of this to the east and west of Jerrabomberra creek are Tertiary pebble gravels, and also quaternary alluvium.\nThere are two andesite dykes intruded across Gladstone Street.\n\nSouth of the South Fyshwick fault is the dacitic andesite of the Ainslie Volcanics.\n\nThe South Fyshwick Fault starts in Narrabundah, runs east from Lithgow St to Tennant Street, crosses the Molonglo river and heads north east to Dundee Hill to join Sullivans Fault.\n\nEducation\nFyshwick residents get preference for:\nA shared Priority Enrollment Area (PEA) of Forrest Primary and Red Hill Primary\nTelopea Park School (for high school)\nNarrabundah College\n\nReferences\n  A History of HMAS Harman and its people: 1943\u20131993, by Lieutenant Annette Nelson, RAN, Canberra 1993, pub DC-C Publications.\n\nFootnotes\n\nSuburbs of Canberra", "Eaubonne () is a commune in the Val-d'Oise department, in the northern suburbs of Paris, France.

The town of Titel has a population of 5,247, while the population of the municipality of Titel is 15,738. It is located in southeastern part of the geographical region of Ba\u010dka, known as \u0160ajka\u0161ka.\n\nName\nIn Serbian, the town is known as Titel (\u0422\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b), in Hungarian as Titel, in German as Titel (and sometimes Theissh\u00fcgel), and in Latin as Titulium.\n\nHistory\nThe Titel Plateau is an elevated region between the Danube and Tisza rivers, close to the confluence; about ; roughly . It has an ellipsoid form and is characterized by steep slopes at the margins. It has a substantial loess cover and is often called the Titel Loess Plateau; the loess on the plateau is considered to contain the most detailed terrestrial palaeoclimate records in Europe, with a thick and apparently continuous record extending to the middle and late Early Pleistocene. It represents a major archaeological site at the Danube-Tisza confluence with prehistoric and ancient findings.\n\nEarly medieval sources are scarce. Slavs are mentioned in the area in the late seventh and early eighth century, while Magyars (Hungarians) settled the Pannonian Plain in 896, already in the next century holding the Tisa-Danube confluence. Grand Prince \u00c1rp\u00e1d (r. 895\u2013907) is believed to have defeated the Bulgars (Salan) at Titel. Titel was an important strategical location, and was included in the B\u00e1cs County. Ladislaus I of Hungary (r. 1077\u201395) and his brother Lampert founded an Augustinian monastery here. On 17 October 1389 a Clement was inscribed at the Vienna University, who in Titel taught reading and cantillation.\n\nIn the 1400s, Titel belonged to the Serbian despot \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107. In 1439 Albert II's army awaited in Titel military aid from the county to help \u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107 defend Smederevo, but the aid never arrived.\n\nFrom 1526, the town was part of the Ottoman Empire. According to the first Ottoman census from 1546, the town had 87 houses, of which most were Serb, three were Croat, one Hungarian, and one Vlach. The duke of the town was Vuk Radi\u0107. That census recorded that five of the citizens were immigrants, meaning that others lived there before Ottomans conquered the town.\n\nIn the outset of the Ottoman rule, the town had one Orthodox and one Catholic church. In the first quarter of the 17th century, the town had three mosques, two tekkes and three medreses.\n\nFrom 1699, the town was part of the Habsburg monarchy. It was included in the Habsburg Military Frontier. Between 1750 and 1763, the town was under civil administration (in the Batsch-Bodrog County of the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary), until it was returned to the jurisdiction of the Military Frontier (\u0160ajka\u0161 Battalion). Between 1763 and 1873, it was the headquarters of the \u0160ajka\u0161 Battalion which, using small armed vessels on the Danube, defended the Austrian border from Turkish attack. However, as early as 1750, the riverboat patrols, manned by the \u0160ajka\u0161 regiments, had begun to operate at Titel.\n\nWhen the Military Frontier was abolished, the Serbs emigrated to Russia in massive numbers. At that time, Banat and the \u0160ajka\u0161 area slowly began to lose its distinctive Serbian character. Hungarians, Germans, Slovaks, Ruthenians and others began to move into the region.\n\nIn 1848 and 1849, Titel was part of Serbian Vojvodina, a Serb autonomous region within the Habsburg Empire. Between 1849 and 1872, it was again part of the Military Frontier, and after 1872, it came under civil administration as a part of the B\u00e1cs-Bodrog County within the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary (part of Austria-Hungary).\n\nIn 1910 there were 5,792 inhabitants: 2,413 Serbs and 1,858 Hungarians. By religion, there were 2,353 Serbian Orthodox; 2,479 Roman Catholics; and 89 Jews.\n\nAfter 1918, the town became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and subsequent South Slavic states. During the World War II Hungarian occupation, in a 1942 raid, 51 inhabitants of the town were murdered, of whom 45 were men, 1 child, and 5 old people. By nationality, victims included 49 Serbs, and 1 Jew.\n\nInhabited places\nTitel municipality encompasses the town of Titel, and the following villages:\n\nVilovo\nGardinovci\nLok\nMo\u0161orin\n\u0160ajka\u0161\n\nDemographics\n\nAs of 2011 census, the municipality of Titel has a population of 15,738 inhabitants.\n\nEthnic groups\n\nThe total population of the Titel municipality was 15,738, including:\n 13,615 Serbs (86.51%)\n 822 Hungarians (5.22%)\n 264 Romani (1.68%)\n 1037 other and undeclared.\n\nAll settlements in the municipality have an ethnic Serb majority.\n\nEconomy\nThe following table gives a preview of total number of employed people per their core activity (as of 2017):\n\nNotable people\n Svetozar Mileti\u0107 (1826\u20131901), advocate, politician, mayor of Novi Sad, the political leader of Serbs in Vojvodina.

He was born Clifford Johnson Jr. in Stone Mountain, Georgia.\n\nBaseball career\n\nNegro leagues\nIn 1940, Johnson initially played for the minor league Atlanta Black Crackers, then quickly moved up to the Toledo-Indianapolis Crawfords before ending up on the Kansas City Monarchs, all at the age of 17. After a solid season, he was selected to the East-West All-Star Game, being the youngest player ever to achieve that distinction.\n\nAfterwards, Johnson played a key role in the 1941 and 1942 Negro League World Series titles won by the Monarchs, a team that included future Hall of Famers Satchel Paige and Hilton Smith. In 1943, Johnson enlisted in the Army during World War II for three years.\n\nFollowing his discharge in 1946, Johnson returned to the Monarchs and went 9-3 with a 3.46 earned run average, helping his team win another pennant, even though he did not pitch in the Series. He went 4-1 in the next two seasons, but rebounded in 1950 with an 11-2 mark and a 2.17 ERA while appearing in his second All-Star Game.\n\nCanadian Provincial League\nIn 1951, Johnson played for the St. Hyacinthe Saints club based in the Canadian Provincial League, where he posted a 15-14 record with a 3.24 ERA and a league-high 172 strikeouts. At the end of the season, his contract was purchased by the Chicago White Sox.\n\nMajor League Baseball\n\nChicago White Sox\nIn 1952, Johnson was assigned to Class A Colorado Springs, where he finished 18-9 with a 3.38 ERA and set a Western League record with 233 strikeouts. He then was promoted to the White Sox, and made his major league debut at the age of 30 on April 17, 1953.\n \nDuring his rookie season at Chicago Johnson pitched in 14 games, starting ten of them, going 4\u20134 with a 3.56 ERA and 44 strikeouts. After spending the entire 1954 season in the minors with Triple A Charleston Senators, Johnson started 16 games for Chicago in 1955. He finished the season 7\u20134 with a 3.45 ERA and 72 strikeouts.\n\nIn his first two years Johnson sandwiched between Triple A Toronto Maple Leafs and the Sox. As a result, in 1956 he pitched in five games with Chicago and went 0\u20131 with six strikeouts and a 3.65 ERA.\n\nOverall, Johnson went 11\u20139 with a 3.51 ERA and 122 strikeouts in 36 games (28 starts) with the White Sox, starting 28 of them, and going 11\u20139 with 122 strikeouts. During the midseason, Johnson was traded by Chicago along with Mike Fornieles, George Kell and Bob Nieman to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for Jim Wilson and Dave Philley.\n\nBaltimore Orioles\nJohnson started 25 games for the Orioles in 1956, going 9\u201310 with a 3.43 ERA and 130 strikeouts in  innings, including two shutouts and nine complete games.\n\nHis most productive season came in 1957, when he finished 14\u201311 with a 3.20 ERA  \nfor a lousy team that finished in fifth place in the then eight team American League. Besides, Johnson posted career numbers in starts (30), complete games (14), shutouts (3) and innings (242.0).\n\nDuring his final season in 1958, Johnson was the Opening Day starter for the Orioles and defeated the Washington Senators, 6\u20131, at Memorial Stadium. Overall, he went 6\u20139 with a 3.88 ERA and 68 strikeouts.\n\nIn a five-year major league career, Johnson finished with a 40-39 record and .344 ERA in 123 pitching appearances (100 starts), including 34 complete games and eight shutouts, while striking out 497 and walking 257 in 716.0 innings of work\n\nFinal years\nJohnson then returned to the minors to play for the Vancouver Mounties of the Pacific Coast League from 1959 to 1960. He finished his career in 1961, while pitching with the Pericos de Puebla in the Mexican League. In 182 minor league games, he went 76-44 with a 3.34 ERA in 1034.0 innings.\n\nCaribbean highlights\nIn between, Johnson played winter ball with the Spur Cola Colonites club of the Panamanian League, who won the 1950-51 pennant and represented Panama in the 1951 Caribbean Series. The team's only victory in the series came behind a strong pitching effort from Johnson, who pitched a two-run, eight-hit complete game over the highly favored Leones del Habana Cuban team.\n\nAfterwards, Johnson pitched for the Tigres de Marianao in the 1954-55 Cuban League season, and was a bright spot for the last-place Marianao, going 12-11 with a 3.29 ERA while leading the league in strikeouts (123), shutouts (5) and innings pitched (174\u2154).\n\nAfter his playing days, Johnson worked for the Ford Motor Company in Kansas City, Missouri, retiring in 1985.

The group began as a split from the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, having an important presence in the Guadalajara metropolitan area, having been previously commanded by Carlos Enrique S\u00e1nchez Mart\u00ednez, \"El Cholo,\" Emilio Alejandro Pulido Salda\u00f1a, \"El Tibur\u00f3n,\" and \u00c9rick Valencia Salazar \"El 85\". El Cholo would be killed in 2021, with  \"El Tibur\u00f3n\" surrendering himself to Mexican authorities soon afterwards. El 85 would be arrested in 2022.\n\nHistory\nThe Nueva Plaza Cartel was born in 2018, as a split from the CJNG. El Salto, Chapala, Juanacatl\u00e1n, Poncitl\u00e1n, Tlajomulco de Zu\u00f1iga and Ixtlahuac\u00e1n de los Membrillos are the areas they dispute.  El Cholo separated from the CJNG, when he was accused of treason after the murder of \"El Colombiano\", an important financial operator of the criminal organization. The group was initially commanded by Carlos Enrique S\u00e1nchez \"El Cholo\" and \u00c9rick Valencia, \"El 85\" (the latter one of the founders of the CJNG), which had supposedly been betrayed. CJNG co-founder Emilio Alejandro Pulido Salda\u00f1a, \"El Tibur\u00f3n,\" would join the Nueva Plaza Cartel as well and was one of the cartel's first bosses. It is reported that the group disputes the municipalities of Zapopan, Tonal\u00e1, Tlajomulco de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Tlaquepaque, the main centers of operations of both drug cartels, in addition to having funding from the Sinaloa Cartel. Before the death of \"El Cholo\", he mentioned in a video, an alleged union with Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch to fight against the CJNG, in addition to being awarded the Tonal\u00e1 massacre. The group is also known for having an easy irruption with the police forces. \n\nEl Cholo previously assassinated a CJNG financier and after El Mencho attempted to retaliate with a failed coup against El Cholo, the Cartel Nuevo retaliated by successfully assassinating the leader of the CJNG assault squad. The group also was involved in the murder of civilians and criminals, who ended up burying them in clandestine graves, such as those found in the municipalities of Tlajomulco de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga and Zapopan.\n\nOn 18 March 2021, members of the CJNG killed El Cholo, but not before questioning him (the latter recorded on video), claiming responsibility for the wave of violence that occurred in Jalisco during those weeks. The body of El Cholo was abandoned in a public square in the municipality of Tlaquepaque, along with a drug message embedded in his torso with a knife. The abandonment of the body in a public square was seen by various media as proof of the ungovernability of the area. According to the autopsy carried out by forensics, It was revealed that El Cholo had seven of his toes broken and one cut off, Both legs broken at the level of the tibia, kneecap, and femur, as well as marks by electric tweezers, his eyes and tongue were extracted while he was still alive, as well as several other injuries around his body such as knife lacerations and broken ribs along with three bullet wounds to the head, Which was the presumed cause of death. After the death of El Cholo, it is known that the successor is Erick Valencia Salazar \"El 85\", who is handling the cartel with a lower profile.\n\nIn March 2021, El Tibur\u00f3n, who was now the Nueva Plaza Cartel's second-in-command, surrendered to Mexican authorities soon after El Cholo's murder.\n\nOn 4 September 2022, El 85 and two of his associates were arrested by Mexican Army and National Guard forces in the Jalisco town of Tapalpa.\n\nReferences\n\nOrganizations established in 2018\n2018 establishments in Mexico\nDrug cartels in Mexico\nMexican drug war\nJalisco", "The Wilds is a private, non-profit safari park and conservation center that combines conservation science and education programs. The park also offers visitors leisure activities such as ziplining, horseback riding, and fishing. Located in southeastern Muskingum County, Ohio, just west of the village of  Cumberland, the Wilds is home to rare and endangered species from around the globe living in natural, open-range habitats.\n\nThe property encompasses  of reclaimed coal mine land and includes  of pastures and a  Carnivore Conservation Center. The Wilds is designated an Audubon Important Bird Area so the property includes a birding station with covered lookout as well as a butterfly habitat with hiking trails, more than  of mountain bike and hiking trails and approximately 150 lakes.\n\nThe Wilds is the largest wildlife conservation center in North America and is open between the months of May and October.\n\nThe Park was made on reclaimed land dug by the dragline Big Muskie.\n\nHistory\n\nIn 1984, the Wilds was incorporated as a 501(c)(3) non-profit under the name The International Center for the Preservation of Wild Animals, Inc. (ICPWA), formalizing a public-private partnership involving the Ohio Departments of Natural Resources and Development, the Ohio Zoos and the private sector that formed in the late-1970s. That same year, the Wilds was gifted its current  from the Central Ohio Coal Company. With a location secured, the Wilds began hiring employees, planning development, and organizing fundraising support.\n\nIn 1989, the Johnson Visitor Center was completed, built with the environment in mind using a state-of-the-art geothermal heating and cooling system. In 1990, the first animal management facilities and fencing of the initial open range began. These projects allowed for the Wilds to receive its first animals, Przewalski\u2019s horses in 1992.\n\nThe Wilds officially opened to the public for tours in 1994. For the next few years, it continued to add animals, improve and expand conservation efforts, and increase public awareness. In 2001, the Wilds began its partnership with the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. This culminated in the completion of the first Strategic Vision Plan in 2005, designed to guide the success and future development of the Wilds for the future.\n\nToday, the Wilds continues working on its mission to advance conservation through science, education and personal experience.\n\nStrategic plan\nIn 2005, the Wilds initiated its long-term strategic plan, which is broken into \"strategic centers\" to facilitate progress in each field.  These \"centers\" are based on the Wilds' core values, which include a commitment and respect for nature, social and scientific relevance, and innovative, entrepreneurial and creative approaches to the problem at hand.\nThe strategic centers are focused on animal management, science and research, conservation education & professional training, land stewardship and habitat management, personal experience, institutional partnerships, and resource development & sustainability.\n\nConservation\n\nThe Wilds is involved in many different conservation methods in an attempt to help reduce the decline of wildlife habitats. These methods range from professional training to animal husbandry to conservation medicine.\n\nIn order to help the development of conservation medicine, The Wilds has started three projects they hope will be models for the conservation medicine initiative as a whole. These include assessing water quality and its effects on marine life, comparing animal health parameters in multiple habitats, and evaluating fresh water mussels for diseases, parasites and toxins. Each of these projects is designed to assess the condition of various wildlife and their habitats, and to develop methods to reduce or reverse the destruction of each ecosystem.\n\nManaged species\n\nGallery\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links \n\nNoble County Tourism\n\nZoos in Ohio\nProtected areas of Muskingum County, Ohio\nTourist attractions in Muskingum County, Ohio\nTourist attractions in Guernsey County, Ohio\nTourist attractions in Noble County, Ohio\nZoos established in 1994", "Oumar Tatam Ly (born 28 September 1963) is a Malian politician who was Prime Minister of Mali from 5 September 2013 to 5 April 2014.

The films have been distributed internationally and purchased by Latin American Studies Departments of every major university in the United States.\n\nCarrescia was awarded a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship in filmmaking in 1995. She has received three NYFA Fellowships and numerous grants from NYSCA, the American Film Institute, the Jerome Foundation, the Open Society Foundations and others.\n\nLife and career \nCarrescia was born in Brooklyn, New York.  Both her parents were Italian immigrants. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Fine Art and Graphic Art at The Cooper Union School of Art and Architecture. After one year as an assistant to graphic designer George Tscherny and another year as assistant art director at an advertising agency, she left for Europe. She studied Spanish language and culture in Spain, the Italian language and culture in Italy, and later worked in Florence after the 1966 Flood of the Arno river.\n\nIn 1969 while working at the Rizzoli Bookstore on Fifth Avenue in New York City, Carrescia - because of her knowledge of Italian - was asked to work on an international feature film. She was trained as a Production Office Coordinator by Gray Frederickson, who would later become a producer of The Godfather films. After completion of production, she returned to Rome, Italy and spent several years working on Italian-American-French co-productions such as Once Upon a Time in the West and The Godfather, Part I and II.\n\nFrom 1976-78, she worked as a researcher, line producer and translator on cultural documentaries for RAI, BBC, and the award winning children's television program, Big Blue Marble, in the United States, Europe and Latin America.\n\nIn 1978, while at Big Blue Marble, Carrescia traveled to Guatemala to produce a segment about a \u201cMayan Mountain Child\u201d. After scouting indigenous villages throughout Guatemala, she visited Todos Santos Cuchumat\u00e1n, a traditional highland village at 9,000 feet above sea level. The segment produced was only five minutes long, but the indigenous people and the exquisite location left a deep and lasting impression.  She left her job at Big Blue Marble to produce her first independent documentary film. She was inspired by ethnographic filmmakers such as David and Judith MacDougall, Robert H. Gardner and Alan Lomax. Because of its striking cinematography and social, political and ethnographic content, her model for the first Todos Santos film was The Tree of Wooden Clogs, a feature film by Italian filmmaker Ermanno Olmi (O. L. Carrescia, personal communication, October 26, 2014).\n\nTodos Santos Cuchumat\u00e1n was shot on 16 mm film in November 1979. In January 1980 an attack on the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala by the Guatemalan military, led to increased violence and a greater interest in Guatemala and its political situation. Carrescia's film received finishing funds from the New York State Council on the Arts, the Jerome Foundation and The Film Fund. It was completed in September 1982 and premiered at the Margaret Mead Film Festival at the Museum of Natural History.\n\nIn 1985, after the election of  Guatemala\u2019s first democratic president in over 30 years, she was able to return to Todos Santos to research the effect of the devastating violence on this once isolated village. Todos Santos: The Survivors was completed in 1989. The third film of the Todos Santos-trilogy, Mayan Voices: American Lives (1994), explores the everyday life of Mayan refugees who settled in Indiantown, Florida.\n\nAfter several years, during which Carrescia obtained a Master's degree in elementary education, she returned to Guatemala to document the work of Guatemala Forensic Anthropology Foundation (FAFG). The result was Sacred Soil (2008) about the ongoing search for remains of indigenous people massacred during the political violence of the 1980s.\n\nIn 2009, Carrescia returned to Todos Santos for what would become her last film to date.  A Better Life: Una Vida Mejor (2011) documents the social, political and economic changes which have taken place in Todos Santos Cuchumatan more than thirty years after her first visit to the village.\n\nOlivia Lucia Carrescia is currently a teaching artist with non-profit arts organizations in New York City.\n\nAwards and Fellowships\n1983 American Film and Video Festival, Blue Ribbon, Anthropology and Ethnography (Todos Santos Cuchumat\u00e1n)\n1984 Creative Artists Public Service Grant (CAPS Fellowship)\n1990 American Film and Video Festival Blue Ribbon, International Issues (Todos Santos: The Survivors)\n1991 Latin American Studies Association Award of Merit (Todos Santos: The Survivors)\n1994 Latin American Studies Association Award of Merit, (Mayan Voices: American Lives)\n1995 Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship, Category Creative Arts, Field of Study: Film\n2003 David J.

The name comes from  - 'much' and  - 'wonder'. It is estimated to have been  long and weighed , and was seen as the largest land animal known at the time of its discovery.\n\nIt was the first ceratopsian known to science from more than teeth, though relatively little is known about it. The original specimen consisted only of the animal's hip bones, hip vertebrae and ribs, and because these bones vary little between ceratopsid species, it is usually considered a nomen dubium. It is provisionally considered a synonym of Triceratops, but is difficult to compare to that genus because it is only known from postcranial remains.\n\nHistory\nThe holotype remains of Agathaumas were first found in 1872 in southwestern Wyoming. They were discovered by Fielding Bradford Meek and Henry Martyn Bannister while they were looking for fossil shells in the Lance Formation near the Black Butte and Bitter Creek. Meek and Bannister were employed by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden's Geological Survey of the Territories and notified paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope of the find. Cope himself searched the ridge near Black Butte and re-discovered Meek's site, finding huge bones protruding from the rocks near a coal vein. The bones were preserved in sand and clay sediments, packed with fossil sticks and leaves, indicating a heavily forested habitat. Cope later (in 1873) described the skeleton as \"the wreck of one of the princes among giants.\" Cope and his team eventually recovered complete hip bones, sacral vertebrae, and several ribs from the animal. Later in 1872, Cope published a description and name for the animal, Agathaumas sylvestris, or \"marvelous forest-dweller,\" in reference to its great size and the environment revealed in the same rocks as its bones. The name Agathaumas has been cited as an example of Cope's excitement with this discovery, which he considered, at the time, as the largest known land animal that had ever lived. Several years later, with the discovery of the giant sauropod dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation, it became clear to him that British forms such as Cetiosaurus and Pelorosaurus were land animals.\n\nClassification history \n \nCope originally did not know to what group Agathaumas belonged, though he noted that some of the remains were similar to the British reptile Cetiosaurus and very different from the corresponding elements of Hadrosaurus and Dryptosaurus (Laelaps). In 1882, Othniel Charles Marsh, Cope's rival in the Bone Wars, suggested that Agathaumas, along with Cionodon, another Cope taxon, was a Hadrosaurid. In 1883, with his description of the skull of Edmontosaurus (Diclonius), Cope also suggested that his taxa Agathaumas, Monoclonius, and Dysganus could be Hadrosaurids. Cope did not assign Agathaumas into the group now recognized as Ceratopsia until later in 1889, when Cope recognized that his genera Monoclonius and Polyonax were related due to Marsh's description of Triceratops fossils. Marsh had already named a group for the horned dinosaurs, Ceratopsidae, but Cope did not recognize this family name as he believed Ceratops could not be distinguished from other taxa; Cope erected a new name, Agathaumidae. Cope later named 2 more \"Agathaumids\", Manospondylus gigas and Claorhynchus trihedrus, based on fragmentary fossils in 1892, expanding his group to 5 genera. \n\nAfter reassessment by John Bell Hatcher, Richard Swann Lull, and Nelda Wright in the 1900s and 1930s, all of the members of Agathaumidae were found to be dubious, and the family name Ceratopsidae was preferred over Agathaumidae. Agathaumas itself was found to be a dubious Ceratopsid by Hatcher and Lull, as well as by John Ostrom and Peter Wellnhofer who placed it as Triceratops sp.\n\nSpecies\nType:\nAgathaumas sylvestris Cope, 1872; 16 vertebrae from the tail, sacrum and back, a partial pelvis and several ribs\nSpecies previously referred to Agathaumas:\nA. flabellatus (Marsh, 1889) Burkhardt, 1892; alternative combination for Triceratops flabellatus; synonymous with Triceratops horridus.\nA. milo Cope, 1874; included with Thespesius occidentalis by Cope, dubious at Hadrosauridae family level.\nA. monoclonius (Breithaupt, 1994); nomen dubium included with Monoclonius sphenocerus\nA. mortuarius (Cope, 1874) Hay, 1901; nomen dubium, alternative combination for Polyonax mortuarius; possible synonym of Triceratops horridus\nA. prorsus (Marsh, 1890) Lydekker, 1893; alternative combination of Triceratops prorsus, unused since\nA. sphenocerus (Cope, 1890) Ballou, 1897; nomen dubium included with Monoclonius sphenocerus\n\nUnfortunately, due to the fragmentary nature of Agathaumas sylvestris\u2019 holotype specimen, Agathaumas is a dubious taxon and cannot be referred beyond Ceratopsidae. based on stratigraphy it is likely a member of Triceratopsini.\n\nKnight's restoration\n\nIn 1897, artist Charles R. Knight painted Agathaumas for Cope. Knight based the painting on the partial skull of the species Agathaumas sphenocerus, which preserved a large nasal horn, and Monoclonius recurvicornis, which preserved small horns over the eyes. A. sphenoceros was originally referred to the genus Monoclonius and later to Styracosaurus, while M. recurvicornis is a possibly a valid species but has yet to receive a new genus. The body was based on a more complete skeleton of the species Triceratops prorsus that had been described by O.C. Marsh. The body armor depicted in the illustration was likely based on the squamosals of Pachycephalosaurus for the larger spikes, and the smaller armor on the dermal scutes of Denversaurus collected in Lance, Wyoming by Marsh's crews in the 1890s. At the time, Monoclonius, Agathaumas, and Triceratops were all thought to be close relatives that differed mainly in the arrangement of the horns and the presence of openings in the frill. This painting was later used as basis for a model Agathaumas in the 1925 film The Lost World.\n\nSee also\n\n Timeline of ceratopsian research\n\nReferences\n\n \n \n\nChasmosaurines\nCretaceous dinosaurs\nDinosaurs of North America\nFossil taxa described in 1872\nNomina dubia\nOrnithischian genera\nTaxa named by Edward Drinker Cope", "Chthonerpeton indistinctum is a species of caecilian in the family Typhlonectidae. It is found in northeastern Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and southeastern Brazil. The common name Argentine caecilian has been coined for it.\n\nDescription\nChthonerpeton indistinctum is a snakelike amphibian with no limbs. It can grow to about . The body has 70 to 80 transverse folds, giving it a segmented appearance. The head has a pair of sensory tentacles between the nostrils and the eyes, and this area of skin is white. The body is black above and dark grey beneath, both with tiny white flecks. The flat, disc-like area surrounding the cloaca is creamy white.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nC. indistinctum is found in Paraguay, Uruguay, Brazil and Argentina at altitudes ranging up to . It is partially terrestrial and partly aquatic, possibly having annual migrations. When on land, it mostly stays close to the river bank, but occasionally ventures some way from water. Occasionally, it gets washed out to sea on mats of vegetation and has been found alive in the brackish water of estuaries. It is a common species, sometimes occurring in very large numbers, and the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species lists it as being of \"Least Concern\".\n\nBiology\nThis species is viviparous, giving birth to live young.\n\nIt is considered to have several characteristics which indicate it is more primitive than other, more highly derived species. As caecilians evolved, their chromosomes are thought to have reduced in number. A number of species were karyotyped, and C. indistinctum was found to have a diploid number of 20 as against one of 28 for the more derived Typhlonectes compressicauda, an unexpected result. Further study is expected to clarify the taxonomic relationships between different species of caecilians.\n\nReferences\n\nindistinctum\nAmphibians of Argentina\nAmphibians of Brazil\nAmphibians of Paraguay\nAmphibians of Uruguay\nAmphibians described in 1862\nTaxa named by Christian Frederik L\u00fctken\nTaxa named by Johannes Theodor Reinhardt\nTaxonomy articles created by Polbot", "Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II, also known as More Bob Dylan Greatest Hits, is the second compilation album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on November 17, 1971 by Columbia Records. With Dylan not expected to release any new material for an extended period of time, CBS Records president Clive Davis proposed issuing a double LP compilation of older material. Dylan agreed, compiling it himself and suggesting that the package include a full side of unreleased tracks from his archives. After submitting a set of excerpts from The Basement Tapes that Davis found unsatisfactory, Dylan returned to the studio in September 1971 to recut several Basement songs, with Happy Traum providing backup.\n\nThe final package included one previously uncollected single, \"Watching the River Flow\", an outtake from the same sessions, \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\"; one song from Dylan's April 12, 1963 Town Hall concert, \"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\", and three songs from the September sessions, \"I Shall Be Released\", \"You Ain't Goin' Nowhere\", and \"Down in the Flood\". The remaining tracks were drawn from existing releases.\n\nIn 2003, this album was released along with Dylan's two other Greatest Hits compilations in one four-disc set, as Greatest Hits Volumes I\u2013III.\n\nAs with The Basement Tapes and the Beatles' 1962-1966, all the selections could fit on a single 80-minute CD, but were nevertheless released on two CDs to match the LP.\n\nArtwork \nThe album package was designed to capitalize on the publicity surrounding George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh, about to be released as a film and album. The photograph on the album cover is a cropped version of a photo taken during Dylan's performance at the concert by the film's still photographer, Barry Feinstein.  The uncropped photo, which appeared as a two-page spread in the booklet included in the album Concert for Bangla Desh (sic), also contained George Harrison, who was standing to Dylan's right.  The album cover is similar to the previous volume, Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, which utilized Rowland Scherman's 1965 photo. Reaching #14 in the US and #12 in the UK, Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II is now certified five times platinum in the US, making it one of Dylan's best-selling albums.\n\nSongs previously unreleased on LP \n\n\"In one sense, 1971 and 1972 might both be considered 'lost' years,\" writes Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin. Neither year would produce an album, at least not an album entirely composed of newly recorded material.\n\nBetween March 16 and 19, 1971, Dylan reserved three days at Blue Rock Studios, a small studio in New York's Greenwich Village. According to Heylin, \"These sessions were produced by Leon Russell of Mad Dogs and Englishmen fame. Only two originals were recorded\u2014'Watching the River Flow' and 'When I Paint My Masterpiece'\u2014but both confronted the same subject matter, a continuing dearth of inspiration, in a refreshingly honest fashion.\"\n\n\"When I Paint My Masterpiece\" was also recorded by The Band, who would release their version first on Cahoots. Dylan's recording from Blue Rock would only see release on Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II.\n\n\"Watching the River Flow\" was issued as a single in June 1971, backed by \"Spanish Is the Loving Tongue\", which had been recorded during the New Morning sessions.\n\nMonths later, Dylan would agree to release a second \"greatest hits\" compilation, provided he could compile it himself, issue it as a double album, and include several older compositions which he had written but never issued himself. To accommodate this last condition, Dylan took it upon himself to hold a recording session at Columbia's Recording Studios in New York. On September 24, 1971, in Columbia's Studio B, Dylan recorded four songs with his friend, Happy Traum.\n\n\"He felt there were some songs that he had written that had become hits of sorts for other people, that he didn't actually perform himself,\" recalls Traum, \"and he wanted to fit those on the record as well...So we just went in one afternoon and did it, it was just the two of us and the engineer, and it was very simple...we chose three [songs] on the spot and mixed them...in the space of an afternoon...Sometimes I wasn't even sure if it was a final take until we would just finish and Bob would say, 'Okay, let's go and mix it.'\"\n\n\"Crash On The Levee (Down In The Flood)\", \"You Ain't Going Nowhere\" and \"I Shall Be Released\" were recorded and selected for the compilation. \"Only a Hobo\", an early composition dating back to 1963, was also considered for inclusion but ultimately was left unreleased until 2013's The Bootleg Series Vol. 10 \u2013 Another Self Portrait (1969\u20131971).\n\nA few lyrical revisions were made on \"You Ain't Going Nowhere\", the most notable being a reference to Roger McGuinn. \"Pack up your money, pull up your tent McGuinn, you ain't going nowhere\". McGuinn's band, The Byrds, had successfully recorded \"You Ain't Going Nowhere\" on their landmark album, Sweetheart of the Rodeo, and they even issued their recording as a single. Country musician Marty Stuart has also recorded this song. According to McGuinn in the liner notes to the 1997 reissue of Sweetheart of the Rodeo, Dylan singled him out in these lyrics for bungling Dylan's original Basement Tapes lyrics on the Byrds version of the song in which McGuinn sings \"Pack up your money / Pick up your tent\" instead of \"Pick up your money / Pack up your tent\" as Dylan had.\n\nThe previously unreleased \"Tomorrow Is a Long Time\" was also included, with the track taken from a recording of Dylan's April 12, 1963 Town Hall concert.\n\nOther notable releases recorded in 1971 \n\nIn addition to the material added to Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits Vol. II, Dylan recorded a single, \"George Jackson.\" An incarcerated black activist, George Jackson died on August 21, 1971. After reading a newspaper article about his death, Dylan quickly wrote an elegy for Jackson and rushed a small band into Blue Rock Studios to record it the following day. He recorded two versions, one following a simple acoustic arrangement, another with a full-band arrangement. Dylan also recorded another original composition, the country-flavored \"Wallflower\". Both versions of \"George Jackson\" were issued on the two sides of a single released on November 12, 1971. The single penetrated the Top 40, peaking at #33 on the Billboard Hot 100. The \"Wallflower\" recording was set aside and would later be released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1-3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961-1991, but was recorded, with Dylan's backing vocal, for Doug Sahm's 1973 recording Doug Sahm and Band.\n\nDylan gave three significant concert performances in 1971, which were professionally recorded and eventually released.\n\nThe first two came on August 1, at Madison Square Garden for a benefit concert organized by George Harrison. Dylan was not scheduled to perform, but Harrison convinced him to make a surprise appearance. Dylan performed a set at both the afternoon and evening shows, backed by Harrison on lead guitar, Leon Russell on bass, and Ringo Starr on tambourine. A selection of his performances was issued on the Grammy-winning The Concert for Bangladesh, issued on December 20, 1971.\n\nThe third and final performance actually came during the first hour of 1972, when he made a surprise appearance at The Band's New Year's Eve concert at New York's Academy of Music. Dylan appeared sometime after midnight and performed four songs backed by The Band: \"Crash on the Levee (Down in the Flood)\", \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\", \"Don't Ya Tell Henry\" and \"Like a Rolling Stone\". Clinton Heylin would later describe Dylan's appearance as \"a return to some approximation of peak performing powers.\" The concert was recorded by Phil Ramone and later mixed and compiled as The Band's Rock of Ages. However, Dylan's set would have to wait until May 2001 for official release, when it was included as part of an expanded, remastered CD edition of Rock of Ages.\n\nTrack listing\nThe UK edition has a different tracklist from that given below. \"Positively 4th Street\" replaces \"She Belongs to Me\" as the first track on disc two. (\"Positively 4th Street\" was missing from the 1967 UK Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, where \"She Belongs to Me\" replaced it.) On side four, \"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\", which had also appeared on the 1967 UK Greatest Hits album as one of the two extra tracks, is replaced by \"New Morning\" as track 2.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\n1971 greatest hits albums\nAlbums produced by Bob Johnston\nAlbums produced by John Hammond (producer)\nAlbums produced by Tom Wilson (record producer)\nBob Dylan compilation albums\nColumbia Records compilation albums\nAlbums produced by Leon Russell", "K\u00f6k\u00e9ny () is a  village in Baranya County, Hungary.\n\nGeography\nIt has a population of 566 people (2005).

He was appointed by Attorney General William Barr during the Trump administration. He is partner at the law firm Kobre & Kim where he handles international government investigations.\n\nEducation\nRaised in Cleveland, Ohio, Sherwin earned his B.A. in political science and liberal arts at the Ohio State University in 1994 and his J.D. at the University of Notre Dame in 1998.\n\nMilitary career \nSherwin served as a naval intelligence officer from 1999 to 2004, participating in Operation Southern Watch, Operation Northern Watch, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sherwin served aboard both the USS John F. Kennedy and USS Theodore Roosevelt as the lead intelligence briefer and targeting officer for Navy fighter squadron VFA-82. Post-9/11, Sherwin joined the intelligence staff of General Tommy Franks at the United States Central Command assisting in the planning of military combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Sherwin was awarded the Joint Service Commendation Medal Oak Leaf Cluster in 2003, among other commendations.\n\nLegal career \nSherwin began his legal career as a law clerk for Chief Judge Paul Ramon Matia, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Ohio. In 2004, he became an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. In 2011, then Attorney General Eric Holder appointed him to serve as part of a special detail for the United States Department of State prosecuting terrorists in Bagram, Afghanistan, where he assisted in more than 120 primary court terrorism trials and 250 appellate cases convened by the Afghan judicial tribunal.\n\nDuring his time as assistant U.S. attorney, Sherwin prosecuted Colombian and Venezuelan drug cartels and kingpins, including the successful conviction of Sigifredo Maya, a top member of the Medell\u00edn Cartel. Sherwin also won multiple convictions of developers and contractors who had stolen tens of millions of dollars from the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program which is supposed to provide housing for people in need. In 2016, he ran the country's largest task force on health care fraud which led the department in health care fraud indictments, trials and asset forfeitures. In 2018 Sherwin joined the Miami office's national security section where he prosecuted counterintelligence cases, economic espionage, and state-sanctioned theft of trade secrets and digital currency.\n\nIn September 2019, Sherwin won the conviction of a Chinese woman, Yujing Zhang, who trespassed at President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida.\n\nIn 2019, Sherwin became associate deputy attorney general for national security advising Attorney General William Barr and Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen at the Justice Department in Washington D.C.\n\nSherwin investigated a deadly December 2019 shooting at a naval air station in Pensacola, Florida. During the investigation he met and impressed Attorney General William Barr, officials told The Washington Post.\n\nU.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia \nBarr asked Sherwin to become the deputy of Timothy Shea at the District of Columbia office in March 2020. Sherwin was named acting U.S. Attorney in April 2020 when Shea, after three months as U.S. Attorney, was appointed to lead the Drug Enforcement Administration. Trump nominated Justin Herdman to be Shea's permanent successor.\n\nSome high-profile investigations the U.S. Attorney's office handled are related to special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\n\nMichael Flynn case \nIn May 2020, Barr moved to dismiss the guilty plea of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn. Flynn had pleaded guilty to charges of lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his conversations in 2016 with Russia's ambassador. Sherwin approved the decision to give to Flynn's defense team internal FBI records that the government cited in its dismissal motion, an official told The Washington Post. Sherwin joined Barr's effort to drop charges in a move that was seen as controversial. Some alleged Sherwin was acting politically to protect Trump allies under Barr's orders, while others cited Sherwin's long history as an apolitical prosecutor in making prosecutorial decisions.\n\nBLM Protests \nSherwin's office arrested hundreds of people in the wake of weeks of protests in D.C. following the murder of George Floyd. The actions took a curious turn when Sherwin, acting in his position as U.S. Attorney at Trump's discretion, came to the defense of Black Lives Matter protestors that DC Mayor Muriel Bowser wanted charged with crimes. Bowser publicly criticized Sherwin for not bringing enough charges against the protesters. Sherwin fired back in a public letter saying her police department had not produced the bare minimum of evidence. \"Surely, by your comments, you are not suggesting that this Office skirt constitutional protections and due process,\" Sherwin wrote.\n\nOther cases \nOn May 28, 2020, Sherwin announced the indictment of 28 North Korean and five Chinese citizens charged with laundering more than $2.5 billion in illegal payments for North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile program.\n\nIn summer 2020, Sherwin closed an investigation into whether a state-owned Egyptian bank financed a $10 million loan by Trump to his campaign in days shortly before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nIn December 2020, Sherwin charged bombmaker Abu Agila Mas\u2019ud in a criminal complaint with designing and building the bomb which took down Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 270 people aboard.\n\nCapitol Riots \nThrough March 2021, Sherwin supervised the early months of investigations into the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol charging 325 individuals. Several participants were indicted on conspiracy charges during Sherwin's tenure and he stated in media interviews he believed the evidence would support possible sedition charges against some participants in the incident. The Biden administration and, later, Attorney General Merrick Garland asked Sherwin to stay on at the Justice Department in another role to continue the prosecutions.\n\nSherwin left the Justice Department in April 2021. During his last week as acting U.S. Attorney, Sherwin did an interview with 60 Minutes in which he said, \"I personally believe the evidence is trending toward\" seditious conspiracy charges, which echoed comments he had made in previous interviews. Two days later, federal Judge Amit Mehta convened an emergency hearing criticizing Sherwin for the comments. While department referrals are required to remain private, federal prosecutor John Crabb announced in open court that Sherwin had been referred to the department's ethics office for conducting a media interview without official permission and commenting on a pending case. Some observers called Sherwin's comments \"improper\", but others came to his defense, saying he provided the public \"some much-needed and welcome insight\" into the cases.\n\nOn March 3, 2021, the Biden Administration appointed Channing D. Phillips acting U.S. Attorney for D.C.\n\nPersonal life\nSherwin is the son of Allen Lewis Sherwin and Nora (Schlachet) Sherwin. Sherwin is the father of three children.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Official biography at the United States Department of Justice\n \n\n1971 births\n21st-century American lawyers\nAssistant United States Attorneys\nLiving people\nNotre Dame Law School alumni\nOhio State University alumni\nPeople from Cleveland\nPlace of birth missing (living people)\nTrump administration personnel\nUnited States Attorneys for the District of Columbia\nUnited States Navy officers", "\"Question...?\" is a song by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, taken from her tenth original studio album, Midnights (2022). Swift wrote and produced the song with Jack Antonoff. A synth-pop track, \"Question...?\" has lyrics where a narrator ponders on a broken relationship and confronts the ex-lover with a series of rhetorical questions. It samples Swift's 2016 single \"Out of the Woods\". The song was released as a promotional single from Midnights on October 25, 2022, by Republic Records. An instrumental version was released two days later.\n\nIn reviews of Midnights, some critics picked \"Question...?\" as an album highlight, praising the lyrical details and production. The song peaked at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100, number 11 on the Billboard Global 200, and within the top-10 on charts of Canada, the Philippines, and Singapore.\n\nBackground and release \nOn August 28, 2022, during her acceptance speech for Video of the Year for All Too Well: The Short Film at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards, singer-songwriter Taylor Swift announced her tenth studio album and its release date for October 21. Soon after, Swift revealed the name of the album, Midnights, and its album cover on social networks but the tracklist was not immediately revealed. Jack Antonoff, a musician who has worked with Swift since 1989 (2014), was revealed as one of the producers of the album through a video she posted on her Instagram account on September 6, 2022, titled, \"The making of Midnights\". On September 21, about a month before the album's release, Swift announced a thirteen episode series called Midnights Mayhem with Me that will be released on the social media platform TikTok, and in each episode the name of one track from the album will be revealed. The title of \"Question...?\", track number seven, was revealed on the third episode on September 26. The track was released exclusively onto Swift's official website for a limited-time download offer on October 25, 2022. The instrumental version was released two days later.\n\nMusic and lyrics \n\"Question...?\" has a duration of three minutes and thirty seconds. It is a synth-pop song with sharp percussion beats. The track's beginning contains a sample of Swift's 2016 single \"Out of the Woods\", from the album 1989 (2014). At one point, the production incorporates sounds of a crowd cheering, which are credited to Antonoff, Antonoff's sister Rachel, Swift's brother Austin, and Dylan O'Brien. Some critics compared the song's arrangement and production to Swift's 2014 single, \"Blank Space\".\n\nIn the lyrics, the narrator ruminates on a broken relationship and how things could have turned out differently. The song depicts the narrator as a \"good girl\" and the ex-lover as a \"sad boy\" in a big city. In the refrain, she wants to confront the ex-lover with a series of questions (\"Did you leave her house in the middle of the night?\" \"Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight when she said it was too much?\" \"Do you wish you could still touch her?\"), to which the answers she has already known. Alejandra Gularte of Vulture described the song as suitable for an \"anxious attached person that gets slightly comfortable with their partner\".\n\nTeen Vogue identified probable lyrical references to Swift's previous songs, such as kissing someone in \"a crowded room\" to \"Dress\" (from 2017's Reputation) and multiple mentions of late-night encounters with a love interest to many 1989 tracks including \"Style\", \"All You Had to Do Was Stay\", and \"How You Get the Girl\". NPR critic Ann Powers cited the lyrics, \"Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room / And every single one of your friends was making fun of you / But 15 seconds later they were clapping too?\", as a highlight portraying \"a scene of romantic persuasion and betrayal\". For Powers, the said lyrics encapsulate women's feelings and anxiety towards how they can be concerned by uncertain love, social pressure, and others' desires for them.\n\nCritical reception \n\"Question...?\" was met with positive reviews from critics. Carl Wilson from Slate considered the track his counterproposal for Midnights's lead single; he praised the song for \"acknowledging the mix of nostalgia and distance that often accompanies such more mature thoughts\". Powers was similarly positive, saying that the track \"is the kind of story song only Swift can write\" and that it captures the emotional sentiments to the details \"so acutely that it stings\". Spencer Kornhaber of The Atlantic said he was impressed by the song's \"twisty storytelling and last-dance wistfulness\". The A.V. Club journalist Saloni Gajjar wrote it contains \"classic Swift charm and potent use of metaphors\", and The Guardian critic Alexis Petridis selected it among the Midnights tracks that are \"filled with subtle, brilliant touches\". For The New York Times critic Jon Caramanica, \"Question...?\" is one of the better album songs lyrically. Praising the production, Bobby Olivier from Spin found the track to have a radio hit potential. In Paste, Ellen Johnson lauded the song as a meticulously produced track, with a more nuanced and restrained production compared to common pop music. On a less complimentary side, Craig Jenkins from Vulture deemed the refrain \"cloying\". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard placed \"Question...?\" last on his ranking of Midnights tracks, writing that even though it is not the strongest album song, it \"boasts some fascinating tidbits to pore over\".\n\nCommercial performance \nFollowing the release of Midnights, \"Question...?\" opened at number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100; its first-week figures included 31 million streams, 21,400 downloads, and 425,000 airplay impressions. Swift became the first act to simultaneously occupy the entire top-10 of the Hot 100 and the woman with the most top-10 entries (40), exceeding Madonna (38). On the Digital Songs chart, it became Swift's record-extending 24th number-one song, propelled by the limited-time downloads offered via her website. In Canada, the song debuted at number 10 on the Canadian Hot 100 and was certified gold by Music Canada on November 14, 2022. \"Question...?\" appeared on various national record charts, at number seven in the Philippines and Singapore, at number eight in Malaysia, at number 11 in Australia, at number 15 in Vietnam, at number 20 in Iceland, at number 21 in Portugal, at number 42 in Sweden, at number 62 in Spain, and at 139 in France. The song ultimately peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Global 200.\n\nAccolades\n\nCredits and personnel \nCredits are adapted from Pitchfork.\nRecording\n Recorded at Rough Customer Studio (Brooklyn) and Electric Lady Studios (New York City)\n Mixed at MixStar Studios (Virginia Beach)\n Mastered at Sterling Sound (Edgewater, New Jersey)\n Dominik Rivinius's performance was recorded by Ken Lewis at Neon Wave Studio (Pirmasens, Germany)\n Evan Smith's performance was recorded by herself at Pleasure Hill Recording (Portland, Maine)\n Sean Hutchinson's performance was recorded by himself at Hutchinson Sound (Brooklyn)\n\nPersonnel\n\n Taylor Swift\u00a0\u2013 vocals, songwriter, producer\n Jack Antonoff\u00a0\u2013 songwriter, producer, programming, percussion, Juno 6, Mellotron, background vocals, recording, crowd applause\n Dominik Rivinius\u00a0\u2013 drums\n Evan Smith\u00a0\u2013 drums\n Sean Hutchinson\u00a0\u2013 drums, percussion\n Rachel Antonoff\u00a0\u2013 crowd applause\n Austin Swift\u00a0\u2013 crowd applause\n Dylan O'Brien\u00a0\u2013 crowd applause\n Megan Searl\u00a0\u2013 assistant engineer \n John Sher\u00a0\u2013 assistant engineer\n John Rooney\u00a0\u2013 assistant engineer\n Serban Ghenea\u00a0\u2013 mix engineer\n Bryce Bordone\u00a0\u2013 assistant mix engineer\n Randy Merrill\u00a0\u2013 mastering engineer\n Laura Sisk\u00a0\u2013 recording\n David Hart\u00a0\u2013 recording\n Ken Lewis\u00a0\u2013 recording\n\nCharts\n\nCertifications\n\nRelease history\n\nTaylor Swift songs\n2022 songs\nAmerican synth-pop songs\nSongs written by Taylor Swift\nSongs written by Jack Antonoff\nSong recordings produced by Taylor Swift\nSong recordings produced by Jack Antonoff\n\nSee also \n\n List of Digital Song Sales number ones of 2022\n\nReferences", "The Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial () also known as the Nameless Library stands in Judenplatz in the first district of Vienna. It is the central memorial for the Austrian victims of the Holocaust and was designed by British artist Rachel Whiteread.\n\nConception\nThe memorial began with an initiative of Simon Wiesenthal. Wiesenthal became a spokesman for the public offense taken over the Mahnmal gegen Krieg und Faschismus in Albertinaplatz, created by Alfred Hrdlicka in 1988, which portrayed Jewish victims in an undignified way. As a result of this controversy, Wiesenthal began the commission for a memorial dedicated especially to the Jewish victims of Nazi fascism in Austria. It was built by the city of Vienna under the Mayor Michael H\u00e4upl, after Rachel Whiteread's design was chosen unanimously by an international jury under the leadership of the architect Hans Hollein. The members of the jury were Michael Haupl, Ursula Pasterk, Hannes Swoboda, Amnon Barzel, Phyllis Lambert, Sylvie Liska, Harald Szeemann, George Weidenfeld, Simon Wiesenthal, and Robert Storr. Individuals and teams of artists and architects from Austria, Israel, Great Britain and the United States were invited to the competition. They were Valie Export, Karl Prantl and Peter Waldbauer as a team; Zbynek Sekal; Heimo Zobernig, working with Michael Hofstatter and Wolfgang Pauzenberger; Michael Clegg and Martin Guttman as a team; Ilya Kabakov; Rachel Whiteread; and Peter Eisenman. The submissions had to take into account the design constraints of the site at Judenplatz, and texts including a memorial inscription and the listing of all concentration camps in which Austrian Jews were killed.\n\nOriginally scheduled to be finished on 9 November 1996, the 58th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the completion was delayed for four years due to various controversies both political and aesthetic, but also setbacks due to concerns over the archaeological excavations beneath the site. The total costs paid by the city of Vienna were 160 million Schillings, including 8 million for the memorial by Rachel Whiteread, 15 million for planning, 23 million for the beginning of construction work, 40 million for structural measures for Misrachi-Haus, and 74 million for the archaeological viewing area. The memorial was unveiled on 25 October 2000, one day before the Austrian national holiday. In attendance was the President of Austria Thomas Klestil, Mayor of Vienna Michael H\u00e4upl, President of the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien Ariel Muzicant, Simon Wiesenthal, Rachel Whiteread, and further dignitaries and guests. \n\nThe memorial was created five years before the erection of the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe in Berlin.\n\nDesign\nThe memorial is a steel and concrete construction with a base measuring 10 x 7 meters and a height of 3.8 meters. The outside surfaces of the volume are cast library shelves turned inside out. The spines of the books are facing inwards and are not visible, therefore the titles of the volumes are unknown and the content of the books remains unrevealed. The shelves of the memorial appear to hold endless copies of the same edition, which stand for the vast number of the victims, as well as the concept of Jews as \"People of the Book.\" The double doors are cast with the panels inside out, and have no doorknobs or handles. They suggest the possibility of coming and going, but do not open.\n\nThe memorial represents, in the style of Whiteread's \"empty spaces\", a library whose books are shown on the outside but are unreadable. The memorial can be understood as an appreciation of Judaism as a religion of the \"book\"; however, it also speaks of a cultural space of memory and loss created by the genocide of the European Jews. Through the emphasis of void and negative casting rather than positive form and material, it acts as a \"counter monument\" in this way opposite to the production through history of grandiose and triumphal monumental objects.\n\nAs a work of art, the memorial was not intended to be beautiful and as such it contrasts with much of the Baroque art and architecture of Vienna. A member of the design jury had noticed a resemblance to a bunker and the military fortifications of the Atlantic wall were later confirmed  by the artist as a source of inspiration for the project. There is an aspect of discomfort in the monument that was meant to provoke thought in the viewer through the memorial's severe presence. It was intended to evoke the tragedy and brutality of the Holocaust and in the words of Simon Wiesenthal at the unveiling, \"This monument shouldn't be beautiful, It must hurt.\"\n\nAt the request of the artist, the memorial was not given an anti-graffiti coating. She explained:\n\nEngravings\n\nAlthough no texts are found on the cast books, two texts are engraved on the base of the memorial. On the concrete floor before the locked double doors is a text in German, Hebrew, and English, that points out the crime of the Holocaust and the estimated number of Austrian victims. In the centre is a Star of David.\n\nEngraved on the plinth on the two sides and back of the memorial are the names of those places where Austrian Jews were murdered during Nazi rule: Auschwitz, Be\u0142\u017cec, Bergen-Belsen, Br\u010dko, Buchenwald, Che\u0142mno, Dachau, Flossenb\u00fcrg, Gro\u00df-Rosen, Gurs, Hartheim, Izbica, Jasenovac, Jungfernhof, Kaiserwald, Kielce, Kowno, \u0141ag\u00f3w, Litzmannstadt, Lublin, Majdanek, Maly Trostinec, Mauthausen, Minsk, Mittelbau/Dora, Modliborzyce, Natzweiler, Neuengamme, Nisko, Opat\u00f3w, Opole, Ravensbr\u00fcck, Rejowiec, Riga, \u0160abac, Sachsenhausen, Salaspils, San Sabba, Sobibor, Stutthof, Theresienstadt, Trawniki, Treblinka, W\u0142odawa, and Zamo\u015b\u0107.\n\nJudenplatz\n\nThe Holocaust Memorial is site specific and would be entirely different if it had been planned and constructed on a different site. Therefore, it is intricately connected with the history, institutions, and other works of art in Judenplatz.\n\nJudenplatz and the memorial are unique in Europe. The square unites the excavations of the medieval synagogue underground, that was burned down in the \"Viennese Geserah\" of 1420, with the modern memorial above ground. On the ground floor of the neighbouring Misrachi house, the Dokumentationsarchiv des \u00f6sterreichischen Widerstandes in co-operation with the Israelitische Kultusgemeinde Wien established an information area. Names and data of the 65,000 murdered Austrian Jews, and the circumstances that led to their persecution and murder, are publicly presented. The museum at the Judenplatz, which is in the Misrachi house, has a permanent exhibition about the history of Judenplatz, and the foundations of the destroyed Or-Sarua synagogue directly under the memorial can be visited. (see also: History of the Jews in Austria).\n\nDuring his visit in August 2007, Pope Benedict XVI paid tribute to the victims at the monument, accompanied by the Chief Rabbi Paul Chaim Eisenberg and other dignitaries.\n\nSee also \nList of Holocaust memorials and museums in Austria\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n Simon Wiesenthal: Projekt: Judenplatz Wien.

The festival offers 3 stages, with a mix of Hip Hop artists in the lineup. Since its inception in 2012, the festival attracts crowds numbering in the tens of thousands and notable acts including Martin Garrix, Armin van Buuren, Hardwell, Steve Aoki, Zedd, Illenium, Tiesto, etc. The Toronto-native Deadmau5 used to be a first-day headliner for multiple years of the festival. He will be making a return in August 2023, with a back to back set with Rezz in the alias; Rezzmau5, for the first time ever! Deadmau5 was a headliner of the first ever VELD, and quickly released a song named after the festival; The Veldt, after this groundbreaking moment in VELD\u2019s history, the festival was truly born!\n\nThe music festival offers 3 uniquely designed concert stages. The main-stage is at the core of VELD\u2019s attraction to EDM lovers alike. In 2022, the main-stage was composed of more LED screens than in any previous years, allowing for outstanding visuals for each artist. At the centre of the stage above the crowd suspended, is the highlight VELD logo represented by a \u2018triangular V\u2019 made out of LED screens. The second stage, (formally known as the Remy Martin Stage), was an incredible upgrade from 2019! Offering more screens, more lights, larger speakers, and high production value. Finally, the third stage, known as the \u2018Sirkus Stage\u2019 is a VELD exclusive and a favourite for fans! This stage hosts mostly house music such as bass house, and tech house. Meanwhile the previously named \u2018Remy Martin Stage\u2019 offers more dubstep, trap, riddim, and other heavy bass face-melting sub-genres of electronic dance music.\n\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 and 2021 editions of the event were cancelled.\n\nHistory\n\n2012 \nIn April 2012, a two-day electronic dance music (EDM) festival to be held at Downsview Park in the Toronto area on August 4\u20135 was announced. The initial line-up included notable EDM acts such as deadmau5, Avicii, Bassnectar, Steve Aoki, Steve Angello, Knife Party, and Nicky Romero. The festival, organized by Charles Khabouth's INK Entertainment, features two neighboring stages and performances by about thirty or so different artists. The event is named after \"The Veldt\", a song by deadmau5 and a veld, \"an Afrikaans word for an open grassland... not unlike the vast field in Downsview Park.\"\n\nOn Saturday, August 5, deadmau5 headlined at the first day of the event. The festival was attended by a crowd numbering around 20,000 concertgoers. Despite rain in the early part of his performance, deadmau5 performed to what the Rolling Stone described as an \"enraptured\" audience in a mood akin to \"a glowing Woodstock\". As the rain eventually stopped, the DJ would perform a 90-minute set which included songs such as the festival's namesake \"The Veldt\", \"Aural Psynapse\" and \"Strobe\". Besides deadmau5 and the other artists announced earlier, the festival included a performance by Avicii, who performed as the final-day headliner.\n\n2013 \n\nDeadmau5 would also headline at the second annual festival held on August 3\u20134, 2013. The year saw the return of Steve Aoki and Steve Angello along with performances by Dada Life, Kaskade, Above & Beyond, and Madeon. Other local Canadian artists included Adventure Club, Carlo Lio, Greg Gow and Manzone & Strong.\n\n2014 \nThe third two-day event in 2014 was sponsored by Red Bull and Bacardi. The festival featured over thirty artists from the EDM and hip-hop genres, including Armin van Buuren, Calvin Harris, Iggy Azalea, NERO, Waka Flocka Flame and Zedd. The concerts were held on the weekend of August 2\u20133.\n\nThe first day of performances began with opening acts that included Oliver Heldens, Overwerk, W&W, Bingo Players. This was followed by an hour-long performance by the British band NERO. The penultimate set of the night was performed by Sebastian Ingrosso, a former member of the Swedish House Mafia. Armin van Buuren performed the final concert of the evening.\n\nSunday featured performances by Adventure Club on the main VELD Stage and a notable performance by SAVOY on the Bacardi Stage. Other performances of the night included Iggy Azalea, Gramatik, Tommy Trash, Zedd, and Knife Party. The night's festivities ended with a set by Calvin Harris which included a performance of popular hit \"Summer\".\n\nOn August 4, Mark Saunders, then deputy chief of the Toronto Police, reported that fifteen people had falling ill after ingesting \"party drugs\" at the event. Of those, thirteen were hospitalized and two had died. One of the dead was handcuffed by police during transport to the hospital and had died in the ambulance. Ontario's Special Investigations Unit (SIU), which investigates possible officer misconduct launched an investigation into the circumstances of his death. SIU concluded their investigation and announced that \"Toronto Police were not responsible for the death.\"\n\nThe Toronto Police Homicide Squad also launched a separate criminal investigation into the deaths and illnesses caused by the drugs. Police urged people that had attended the event to hand over any drugs obtained at the event in order to aid in the investigation. On August 5, Police revealed that the investigation was focused on two drugs found at the event, \"a 'small brown pill' and a 'small clear capsule with a white substance' [but that] police don't yet know what drug caused the illnesses.\" The investigation concluded, a year later, that the deaths were accidental.\n\n2015 \nIn February 2015, INK Entertainment announced that deadmau5 will again be one of the headliners of the summer event to be held August 1\u20132. In April, it was announced that Hardwell will be the final headliner in the second day of the event. Other notable artists announced included A$AP Rocky, Borgore, Carnage, Chocolate Puma, DVBBS, Gorgon City, Hot Since 82, Kill the Noise, Laidback Luke, Nicky Romero, Oliver Heldens, Pretty Lights, Steve Aoki, and The Chainsmokers.\n\nOn July 19, the Toronto Star reported that the \"organizers are vowing to crack down on illicit substance use at the event.\" Among the safety measures announced were two \"amnesty boxes\" at the entrance to collect unwanted illegal drugs and advisory packets which included maps directing people to medical, food and water stations. There would also be public service announcements in between performances and a designated \"safe and chill space\" where festival-goers with adverse drug reactions can be assessed.\n\nDay one of the 2015 festival began with a performance by Manzone & Strong. Later in the day, a set by The Chainsmokers was interrupted due to a weather alert. The festival eventually continued, after a delay, with a performance from Steve Aoki who rallied the crowd. The second stage saw the rowdy performances by Borgore and A$AP Rocky. In typical fashion, the evening ended with a set from deadmau5, returning for his third time to the VELD stage.\n\nDay two began with a performance by Dzeko & Torres on the main stage while SNBRN performed a set on the Bacardi Stage. Around 6 pm, after a performance by Oliver Heldens, there was an announcement that due to the approaching storm the remainder of the event would be canceled and that the area evacuated. However, some people in attendance lingered a while before complying with the evacuation. The weather took a serious turn for the worse with a storm that included thunder, lightning, and hail. Nonetheless, INK Entertainment received criticism for the cancellation and demands for a refund through social media. Organizers announced a few days later that they would offer a forty percent refund for all tickets purchased at authorized retailers. Above & Beyond, Duke Dumont, Hot Since 82 and Hardwell, the headliner of the evening, were among the acts that never made it to the stage.\n\n2016 \nIn March 2016, it was announced that this year's festival will see the return of deadmau5, DVBBS, Steve Aoki and The Chainsmokers along with Travis Scott, Flume, Kygo, and Martin Garrix. In June, the full lineup for the July 30\u201331 event was announced and included Post Malone and Duke Dumont, among others. The organizers stated that similar safety measures will be in place this year with additional stations and staff. The company also rented a nearby building to serve as an additional medical center staffed with a doctor and nurses.\n\nThe Saturday concerts began with a set by Galantis followed by another DJ duo Yellow Claw. This was followed by another performance by Steve Aoki, a veteran of the VELD stage. Duke Dumont, who had missed out on the previous year's festival due to bad weather, performed on the second stage, now renamed the Terra Stage. The main stage saw performances by DVBBS followed by a half-hour set by Flume. The night's festivities ended with a performance by deadmau5, who would again play the festival's namesake song \"The Veldt\". The artist unveiled for the first time his new stage with a distinct cube design.\n\nSunday performances began under cloudy skies that soon cleared. The first on the main stage was New World Punx while Ephwurd performed on the second stage. The Chainsmokers, whose performance the previous year had been partially interrupted, would perform on the main stage. Kygo performed the second to last set on the main as the sun began to set. The evening ended with the headliner of the event Martin Garrix. His performance was capped off with fireworks fired from the stage.\n\n2017 \n\nIn April 2017, it was announced that this year's festival would feature performances by Future, Major Lazer, and Ti\u00ebsto. The organizers later announced that Zedd will also be one of the headliners of the event. The festival on August 5\u20136 will also include 3LAU, A$AP Ferg, Borgore, Madeon, Migos, Lil Uzi Vert, Slushii, Tory Lanez, W&W and a few dozen more artists.\n\n2018\nIn late February 2018, it was announced that the 2018 festival would include headline performances by DJ Snake and Marshmello, alongside returning 2016 headliner Martin Garrix and side stage act from 2017, Migos. The event was held on the first weekend of August, the 4th and 5th.\n\nThe first day suffered from grievances such as the late arrival of Migos and large groups of people crowding the water filling stations. The Migos actually switched the stage they were supposed to perform at last minute.\n\nOn the second day the water situation was improved by adding another water station, queues for the stations, and a large sprinkler. Before the last performance of the festival by Martin Garrix, a tribute set to the song Fade into Darkness was held for Avicii who had died earlier that year.\n\n2019\nIn March 2019, VELD music festival announced via Instagram that the festival would be returning in the summer for its 8th annual year. A few weeks later, lineups were announced, with Skrillex, Tiesto, Cardi B and Kygo headlining the festival. VELD 2019 ran from August 3 to August 4, 2019, in Downsview Park, Toronto, Ontario. Day 1 received positive reviews because of DJs such as Skrillex, Ekali and TroyBoi putting on amazing shows. Some negative criticism was received because of headliner Cardi B who showed up 55 minutes late and played for just 20 minutes. The second day was reviewed as much better with Zeds Dead taking over the Hennessy Stage and Tiesto closing out the festival on the main stage. The overall praise of the festival was overwhelming with people demanding the festival to run 3 days for the year 2020 and to not longer invite performers who abuse the timings of the show such as Cardi B.\n\n2020\nVELD Music festival was expected to take place August 1\u20132, 2020, in Downsview Park, Toronto, ON. VELD was praised for no longer inviting a hip-hop artist on the mainstage because of repeated abuses of showing up extremely late (Migos, Cardi B). VELD 2020 instead will have hip-hop artists on the Hennessy Stage and have all 4 headliners on the mainstage as EDM artists including Armin Van Buuren, Illenium, Marshmello and Martin Garrix.\n\nHowever, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Toronto Mayor John Tory announced on May 15, 2020, that all public gatherings of 25,000 or more are prohibited and no permits will be issued for these events until at least August 31. This resulted in the cancellation of the 2020 edition of VELD.\n\n2021\nThe 2021 edition of the VELD Music Festival was scheduled to take place on July 31 - August 1, 2021, at Toronto's Downsview Park. However, the City of Toronto announced on May 14 that it is \"extending the cancellation of all in-person City-led and City-permitted outdoor events to September 6, 2021\". As a result, the festival was cancelled for the second year in a row.\n\n2022\nVeld Music Festival took place July 29\u201331 and was the first VELD back after the coronavirus pandemic. VELD 2022 hosted three-days of rave action and was the largest Veld to date. Headliners such as Martin Garrix, Marshmello, and Porter Robinson left stunning performances. Rappers such as Nardo Wick, Polo G, and the City Girls were expected to perform. Unfortunately, the famous Galantis and Nardo Wick had canceled on short notice. VELD 2022 brought in the infamous and VELD Main-Stage, the beloved \u201cSirkus Stage\u201d, and the sponsored \u201cR\u00e9my Martin Stage\u201d.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nMusic festivals in Toronto\nMusic festivals established in 2012\nElectronic music festivals in Canada\n2012 establishments in Ontario", "Selective soldering is the process of selectively soldering components to printed circuit boards and molded modules that could be damaged by the heat of a reflow oven or wave soldering in a traditional surface-mount technology (SMT) or through-hole technology assembly processes. This usually follows an SMT oven reflow process; parts to be selectively soldered are usually surrounded by parts that have been previously soldered in a surface-mount reflow process, and the selective-solder process must be sufficiently precise to avoid damaging them.\n\nProcesses\nAssembly processes used in selective soldering include:\n Selective aperture tooling over wave solder: These tools mask off areas previously soldered in the SMT reflow soldering process, exposing only those areas to be selectively soldered in the tool's aperture or window. The tool and printed circuit board (PCB) assembly are then passed over wave soldering equipment to complete the process. Each tool is specific to a PCB assembly.\n Mass selective dip solder fountain: A variant of selective-aperture soldering in which specialized tooling (with apertures to allow solder to be pumped through it) represent the areas to be soldered. The PCB is then presented over the selective-solder fountain; all selective soldering of the PCB is soldered simultaneously as the board is lowered into the solder fountain. Each tool is specific to a PCB assembly.\n Miniature wave selective solder : This typically uses a round miniature pumped solder wave, similar to the end of a pencil or crayon, to sequentially solder the PCB. The process is slower than the two previous methods, but more accurate. The PCB may be fixed, and the wave solder pot moved underneath the PCB; alternately, the PCB may be articulated over a fixed wave or solder bath to undergo the selective-soldering process. Unlike the first two examples, this process is toolless.\n Laser Selective Soldering System: A new system, able to import CAD-based board layouts and use that data to position a laser to directly solder any point on the board. Its advantages are the elimination of thermal stress, its non-contact quality, consistent high-quality solder joints and flexibility. Soldering time averages one second per joint; stencils and solder masks may be eliminated from the circuit board to reduce manufacturing costs.\n\nLess-common selective soldering processes include:\n Hot-iron solder with wire-solder feed\n Induction solder with paste-solder, solder-laden pads or preforms and hot gas (including hydrogen), with a number of methods of presenting the solder\n\nOther selective soldering applications are non-electronic, such as lead-frame attachment to ceramic substrates, coil-lead attachment, SMT attachment (such as LEDs to PCBs) and fire sprinklers (where the fuse is low-temperature solder alloys).\n\nRegardless of the selective soldering equipment used, there are two types of selective flux applicators: spray and dropjet fluxers. The spray fluxer applies atomized flux to a specific area, while the dropjet fluxer is more precise; the choice depends on the circumstances surrounding the soldering application.\n\nMiniature wave selective solder fountain\nThe miniature wave selective solder fountain type is widely used, yielding good results if the PCB design and manufacturing process are optimized. Key requirements for selective fountain type soldering are:\n\nProcess\n Nozzle diameter selection according to solder-joint geometry, nearby component clearance, component lead height and wettable or non-wettable nozzle\n Solder temperature: Set value or actual value on plated through-hole part\n Contact time\n Preheating\n Flux type: No-clean, organic-based; method of fluxing (spray or dropjet)\n Soldering: Drag, dip or angle method\n\nDesign\n Temperature requirement (for soldered part) and component selection\n Nearby SMD through-hole component clearance\n Ratio of component pin diameter to plated through-hole\n Component lead length\n Thermal decoupling\n Solder masking (green masking) distance from component pad\n\nDrop-Jet \nThe Drop-Jet is an Electromechanical device which is capable of depositing a droplet of flux on demand onto a surface such as a Printed Circuit Board and or component pin.\n\nThermal Profiling\nThe thermal profile of the selective process is critical as with other common automated soldering techniques.\nTopside temperature measurements within the pre-heat stage must be verified as with conventional flow solder machine, additionally flux activation must be verified as sufficient.\nAs number of miniature profiling dataloggers are now available to make the process more simple such as the Solderstar Pro units.\n\nSelective Solder Optimization\nA number of fixtures are available to allow daily checking of the selective solder process, these instruments allow the verification of machine parameters to be performed on a periodic basis.\nParameters such as contact time, X/Y speeds, nozzle wave height and profile temperature can all be measured.\n\nUse of Nitrogen Atmosphere \nSelective soldering is normally undertaken in a nitrogen atmosphere. This prevents oxidation of the fountain surface and results in better wetting. Less flux is needed with less left-over residue.

Although various artists have recorded different verses, the chorus has remained consistent:\n\nOrigins\nThe lines \"If you don\u2019t believe I love you, look what a fool I\u2019ve been / If you don\u2019t believe I\u2019d fall for you, look what a hole I\u2019m in\" were recorded by the New Orleans jazz musician Clarence Williams in 1921 and again by Leona Williams in 1922 as \"If You Don't Believe I Love You, Look What a Fool I've Been\".\n\nGus Cannon claimed to have written the opening line, \"Put your arms around me like a circle 'round the sun\". Consequently, Cannon is sometimes credited with authorship of the song. However, this line does not appear in any of his recorded songs, but does appear in the folk song \"I Know You Rider\" and may actually predate Cannon. \"She's a married woman, but she comes to see me all the time\" is another lyric associated with Gus Cannon, which appeared in his \"Minglewood Blues\" recorded January 30, 1928.\n\nMemphis Jug Band\nThe song was first recorded by the Memphis Jug Band as \"Stealin', Stealin'\". The recording session took place on September 15, 1928, in Memphis, Tennessee, and featured Will Shade on harmonica, Charlie Burse lead vocal and guitar, Ben Ramey on harmony vocal and kazoo, and Jab Jones on jug. Victor Records released it as a single in 1929, with Shade listed as the songwriter.  The song is included on several compilation albums.\n\nGrateful Dead\n\"Stealin'\" was recorded by the San Francisco, California-based psychedelic rock band the Grateful Dead early in their career. Known as the \"Scorpio Sessions\", a limited release in July 1966 by Scorpio Records included Henry Thomas's \"Don't Ease Me In\". On October 21, 2002, the sessions appeared on the band's twelve-CD box set The Golden Road (1965-1973).\n\nJerry Garcia also recorded the song with friend and collaborator David Grisman, which appeared on the album Shady Grove in 1996, and on the compilation album, Acoustic Disc 100% Handmade Music, Volume 3 in 1997.\n\nAlbum appearances\n\nDave Van Ronk and the Ragtime Jug Stompers, Dave Van Ronk, 1960\nGreat White Wonder II, Bob Dylan, 1970\nLittle Games, the Yardbirds, 1967\nRunning Down the Road, Arlo Guthrie, 1969 (also appears in the 1971 film Two-Lane Blacktop)\n\nReferences\n\n1929 songs\nBlues songs\n1966 singles\nAmerican folk songs\nGrateful Dead songs", "The Hunchback is an epithet applied to:\n\n Adam de la Halle (1240\u20131287), French poet, composer and musician\n Alfonso Fr\u00f3ilaz, briefly the king of the unified kingdom of Asturias, Galicia and Le\u00f3n in 925\n Godfrey IV, Duke of Lower Lorraine (died 1076)\n Inge I of Norway (1135\u20131161), a king of Norway\n John the Hunchback (), Byzantine general and politician\n Konrad II the Hunchback (1252/65\u20131304), Duke of \u015acinawa, patriarch of Aquileia and Duke of \u017baga\u0144\n Louis VIII, Duke of Bavaria (1403\u20131445)\n Mahmud I (1696\u20131754), Sultan of the Ottoman Empire\n Pepin the Hunchback (c. 768/769\u2013811), Frankish prince, eldest son of Charlemagne\n Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester (1104\u20131168)\n W\u0142adys\u0142aw the Hunchback (c. 1303/1305\u20131351/1352), Polish prince\n\nSee also\n Alasdair Crotach MacLeod (1450\u20131547), Scottish chief of Clan MacLeod, Crotach being Scottish Gaelic for \"hunchbacked\"\n\nLists of people by epithet", "Lee Hsiao-hung (; born 11 February 1979 in Taipei) is a Taiwanese judoka, who competed in the women's heavyweight category.

At  Makalu is the fifth-highest mountain in the world and an eight-thousander.\n\nThe expedition, led by , approached the mountain from the south through Nepal and then wound around into Tibet, in China, to reach the summit from the north face. Thanks to good snow conditions and weather, as well as good leadership, the entire team of mountaineers and one of the Sherpas reached the summit \u2013 Jean Couzy and Lionel Terray on 15 May 1955, followed next day by Jean Franco, Guido Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu; and then Jean Bouvier, Serge Coup\u00e9, Pierre Leroux and Andr\u00e9 Vialatte on 17 May.\n\nBackground\n\nTopography\nMakalu is, after Mount Everest and Lhotse, the highest mountain on a ridge running east from Everest itself. The east-west Kangshung Glacier and the Kama valley in Tibet lie to the north of the ridge and the Barun Glacier and Barun River in Nepal flow along the southern flank. The high mountains Pethangse, Chago and Kangchungtse (also known as Makalu II) are also on the ridge between Everest and Makalu. At  Makalu is the fifth-highest mountain in the world and an eight-thousander. Chomo Lonzo (), is on a ridge northeast of Kangchungtse and due north of Makalu.\n\nMakalu is generally in the shape of a four-sided pyramid with its faces scooped out in vast cirques. Of its four ridges, two \u2013 the southeast and northwest \u2013 form the Tibet\u2013Nepal border and a third ridge, the southwest, slopes down to the Barun Glacier. The west cirque forms the face between the southwest and northwest ridges down which flows the Makalu Glacier and high up beside this glacier lies the smaller northwest cirque.\n\nExploration and climbing history\n\nWhen the 1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition was exploring the Kama valley to discover whether it afforded a route to Everest from the east, Makalu dominated the southern view. A party led by Charles Howard-Bury on a side excursion\nreached a  peak on the ridge between Makalu and Pethangtse and photographed the scene. Local inhabitants thought Makalu was higher than Everest because it is much more visible than Everest which is obscured by the surrounding high peaks. In 1933 after two aircraft had flown over Mount Everest and aerial photographs had been taken of the region, The Times published a special supplement with a full-page photograph on the first page entitled \"the awe-inspiring summit of Everest as seen slightly from the north-west\" \u2013 in fact the photograph was of the northwest ridge of Makalu. In 1951 and 1952 two British reconnaissance expeditions in Nepal assessed the west face of Makalu from a climbing perspective.\n\nIn 1954 the first American party to Himalaya, led by William Siri and with Ang Tharkay as sirdar, attempted the mountain from the Barun Glacier via the northwest and southeast ridges. On the latter route they reached . At very much the same time a party led by Edmund Hillary also examined the northwest ridge.\n\nFollowing the French triumph on Annapurna in 1950, Nepal had granted France an opportunity for climbing Everest in 1954 but this became a less prestigious  prospect after the British success in 1953. French mountaineers' ideas turned to Makalu because it was an attractive and challenging peak which had not been attempted previously. Exploration as well as mountaineering would be required. They were granted slots for autumn 1954 and spring 1955. So, the same French party that was to reach Makalu's summit in 1955 carried out a reconnaissance expedition in 1954 that reached Makalu Col, just below Kangchungtse on Makalu's northwest ridge. From there they reached the summits of Kangchungtse () and Chomo Lonzo and ascended to about  on the northwest ridge towards the top of Makalu itself.\n\nPreparations\n\nExpedition members\nIn 1954 the climbers were: Jean Franco, leader; Jean Bouvier (supplies); Jean Couzy (specialised equipment including oxygen); Pierre Leroux; Guido Magnone (technical repairs and development) and Lionel Terray (filming) together with Jean Rivolier (doctor) and Pierre Bordet (geologist). In 1955 Serge Coup\u00e9 and Andr\u00e9 Vialatte (transport and liaison with Gyalzen Norbu) also took part as climbers and Michel Latreille was a second geologist. Andr\u00e9 Lapras replaced Rivolier as doctor.\n\nGyalzen Norbu was the chief Sherpa (sirdar) and Pasang Phutar the head porter (replaced in 1955 by Kindjock Tsering, on leave from the Brigade of Gurkhas). The nine Sherpas in 1954 were Ang Tsering; Da Norbu; Eila Namgyal; Gyalzen II; Mingma Tsering; Pa Norbu; Pemba Norbu; Pemba Tenzing and Tashi. In 1955 there were 23 Sherpas:  Aila; Ang Bao; Ang Phutar; Ang Tsering (cook, known as Panzy); Ang Tsering IV; Chotaree; Chumbee; Da Norbu; Dagang Norjee; Eila Namgyal; Gunden; Gyalzen II; Mingma Tsering I; Mingma Tsering II; Mingma Tenzing; Nim  Temba; Nim Tenzing; Pa Norbu; Pasang Dawa; Pemba Norbu; Pemba Tenzing; Tashi and Wongdi.\n\nIn 1954 there were 180 porters, mostly men but some women, taking 6.5 tons of baggage to Base Camp and in 1955 this was increased to 315 porters and 11 tons of baggage.\n\nTechniques and equipment\nFranco, the team leader, liaised with Maurice Herzog, leader of the 1950 Annapurna expedition. Acclimatisation issues were discussed with Griffith Pugh of the 1953 Everest expedition and Couzy developed acclimatisation and supplementary oxygen procedures. Magnone dealt with procuring suitable oxygen equipment. The 1952 Swiss Everest team, based on their own experience, advised using the autumn 1954 opportunity to mount a reconnaissance effort, followed in 1955 by a full-scale attempt on the summit.\n\nOpen-circuit oxygen equipment was to be used by the climbers above Camp IV and Sherpas above Camp V. An improved type, using a lighter metal alloy and able to hold a higher pressure of oxygen, was shipped out separately once the equipment was ready in January 1955. Unfortunately the new oxygen regulators  were often faulty but Magnone was able to improve them and he also enabled an increase in maximum flow by adding a second valve. They took French radio sets for receiving weather forecasts from Calcutta and for communications between camps. These they found light, simple to use and reliable.\n\n1954 reconnaissance\n\nThe reconnaissance in 1954 involved finding a suitable approach route up the line of the Arun River and, as well as appointing Sherpas from Sola Khumbu and Darjeeling, they hired local porters in Biratnagar and Sedoa. This approach was successful and was also used in 1955. Equipment was tested and, in particular, lightweight crampons with long spikes were found to be a good innovation. The Sherpas' feet were found far to short and wide for their boots to fit satisfactorily so they took templates for boots to be specially made for the following year. Unfortunately, the French manufacturers could not believe feet could be this shape and so made them the same as before.\n\nThey investigated the two most likely routes to the summit \u2013 the southeast and northwest ridges \u2013 and climbed the neighbouring peaks of Chago, Pethangtse, Kangchungtse and Chomo Lonzo both for acclimatisation and to get a good view of Makalu's topography. This decided an approach up the Makalu Glacier in the west cirque leading to the upper northwest cirque and then a traverse beneath Kangchungtse leading to a steep climb up to the Makalu Col. They made an attempt for the summit along the northwest ridge but did not reach above about . To avoid the difficult northwest ridge in 1955 they planned to cross the Col and move onto the north face for the topmost .\n\nIt was shown from experience that it was seriously counterproductive to spend more than ten days at Camp III or above.\n\n1955 expedition\n\nDeparture from France and march-in\n\nThe expedition flew from Orly Airport and arrived in Calcutta on 12 March. Most of the equipment had been sent on ahead. However their oxygen sets were mistakenly transported to Rangoon rather than Calcutta so Couzy had to fly out there to sort things out while Coup\u00e9 waited behind for him in Dharan with a contingent of porters to catch up the main expedition. From Calcutta the party flew to Biratnagar in Nepal where they met their Sherpas from Darjeeling. They had to deal with custom officers when entering Nepal \u2013 the previous year there had been no customs formalities. Gyalzen Norbu could not speak French and had difficulty with English but in Nepalese he was very effective in dealing with matters and organising the Sherpas and porters. A very bumpy road led them by lorry to Dharan \u2013 in the 1954 monsoon they had taken three days to cover the thirty miles but this time the journey only took a few hours. Here they met the Sherpas hired from Sola Khumbu together with over a hundred porters from there who had trekked for 15 days across Nepal in the hope of being employed.\n\nThe student geologists Bordet and Latreille departed on their separate expedition. On 20 March the trek towards Makalu began from Dharan where the Ganges plain starts to rise to become the Himalayan foothills. On the approach march the climbers did not carry loads and Sherpas only started carrying at Base Camp so the porters were left to labour under loads of . The porters from Sola Khumbu had plaits and wore long coats and multi-coloured boots whereas those from Darjeeling, with greater contact with Western culture, were more smartly dressed but looked less picturesque. The local porters wore loincloths and went barefoot. Panzy, the cook, had been on the French Annapurna expedition but since then he had been cook on several British expeditions and had developed a cuisine that did not suit the French palette.\n\nThe route passed through a tropical afforested region to Dhankuta then went via Legua Ghat and on north beside the Arun river. Approaching the village of Num the Arun gorge was so deep the track had to leave the line of the river. At Num their trail had to cross the river on a  rope bridge  above the water \u2013 the bridge had been repaired specially for them. Now able to see Makalu, they passed through the last inhabited places of Etane and Sedoa. The little village of Sedoa, set on the side of a mountain at  and far from the road north to Tibet, was where the Biratnagar porters were paid off after nine days' march. In turn 100 men from Sedoa were hired for the onward carry. It was here that mountaineering equipment was issued to replace lightweight clothing.\n\nOn 30 March the party left Sedoa with additional auxiliary porters to support the Sherpas, chosen from among the most capable of the Sola Khumbu and Darjeeling porters. The trail rose to  and, in the wind and snow and with the temperature falling to  at night, the porters had hardly any clothes and only emergency tarpaulins to cover them at night when they resorted to huddling together in groups of 10 to 15. Two sheep they had been taking with them for food died of cold and fatigue. The previous autumn leeches had been a big difficulty but this year, in colder, dryer conditions, they were much less of a problem.\n\nA runner brought news that Couzy had successfully retrieved the oxygen sets from Rangoon and was following five or six days behind Franco's party. In the event he arrived at base camp only two days after Franco.\n\nBase camp\n\nOn 4 April Franco and Magnone reached the snout of the Barun glacier where base camp was to be. At the previous year's site, somewhat higher, the water supply had vanished along with the vegetation. The equipment cached last year was still secure. Base Camp was well appointed. Sleeping tents were two-man with triple roofing, and there were communal tents and two very large mess-tents. In all there were thirty separate tents. They constructed a stone shack, which they called the \"Makalu Hotel\" with fireplace, chimney and a canvas roof. About mid April the geologists rejoined the main party.\n\nBack towards Sedoa there had been deep snow, which had not fallen at base camp and until this cleared they were not able to get additional supplies or post \u2013 mail runners took ten days to get from Jogbani to Base Camp, a distance of about .\n\nPacks of food and climbing gear were prepared for going up the mountain. These weighed  for taking to Camp III,  for Camp IV and  for above that. Transporting these supplies involved 20 to 30 people setting off for Camp I each day. On 23 April the expedition as a whole occupied Camp I with only a small group staying at base to return again to Sedoa and make a last carry to Camp I. No one returned to Base Camp until after Makalu had been climbed.\n\nLocations of camps\n\nNorthwest cirque\n\nOn 23 April Camp I was established in a small dip on a rocky spur at  and Camp II, established 29 April, was above a rocky hummock at the entry to the northwest cirque. Acclimatisation training continued during this time and Franco identified Terray and Couzy as likely lead candidates for the summit but he felt happy to have a very strong team around him. The weather was good \u2013 sunny and calm in the mornings but windy and cloudy with snow showers in the afternoons. Only once was there a violent storm. They had arranged for radio broadcasts of weather forecasts from Radio Calcutta but nothing materialised until one day they received a forecast along with ones for the Germans concurrently on Dhaulagiri, where the forecast was for severe storms, and for the British Kangchenjunga expedition. Franco's party could see poor weather around them on Everest, Lhotse and Chamlang which encouraged them to hasten their preparations. Latreille and Vialatte took the opportunity of climbing Pethangtse prior to Latreille and Bourdet embarking on further geologising around Sola Khumbu and Namche Bazaar. Supplies were continually being carried by the Sherpas as high as Camp III which was stocked to become Advanced Base Camp. There the tents were set in  deep platforms dug into the glacier and by 10 May the camp held sufficient supplies and equipment for a summit attempt. Cooking could not be done on paraffin stoves at such an altitude and so gas cylinders needed to be used.\n\nThe plan from Camp III to Camp V at Makalu Col was as follows. The route upward would be made suitable for Sherpas with heavy loads and eventually over  of fixed rope were set in place. Pairs of climbers each accompanied by a few Sherpas would carry loads up each day and would immediately drop down to Camp III or below to make way for a subsequent team. To be successful this would require reliable radio communications and good weather. Above Camp III the Sherpas were to be given the same high-altitude rations as the French climbers. A single \"heavy carry\" would be done to establish Camp V on the Col in one large effort with at least 20 Sherpas becoming involved. An immediate descent to as low a camp as possible would be necessary because acclimatisation was impossible at the height of the Col. Bouvier and Leroux had found that on the traverse beyond Camp III what had been an easy snowy terrace in 1954 was now very slippery bare ice.\n\nCamp IV was at a place they called the balcony, high on the back wall of the northwest cirque and between two couloirs, and to reach there high-altitude clothes were used by climbers and Sherpas alike. Fixed ropes were installed for the traverse and steps were cut up the  wall sloping at about 45\u00b0 and crossing the bergschrund at about . Eventually, after much rope-setting and relaying of stores, Camp V, on Makalu Col, was reached on 8 May and the \"heavy carry\" to establish this camp took place the next day, all in favourable weather. Camp V now held supplies enough for several teams to spend a few days if they were stormbound.\n\nSummit attempts\nFrom the large and desolate Makalu Col the attempts on the summit were to be across the north face of Makalu because it seemed more straightforward than the direct line up the northwest ridge. They had not ventured on the north face in 1954 but had been able to observe it from Chomo Lonzo and Kangchungtse. It was hoped that only one camp would be needed for the last  of the mountain. On the north side of the mountain a wide glacier slopes gradually down into Tibet from between Kangchungtse, Makalu and Chomo Lonzo before it becomes a series of huge icefalls plunging down to the Kama valley and Kangshung glacier. After a gradual ascent to about  the slope gets a lot steeper when a spur leads towards the summit.\n\nFrom 9 May, Camp V on the Col could be accessed safely by Sherpas in fine weather, even when unaccompanied by climbers. Equipment, including three tents, left behind from 1954 was still available. Given the considerable supplies at Camp III and above, the plan was for separate groups of climbers each to attempt the summit at 24-hour intervals. The first party of Couzy and Terray with five Sherpas in support would pitch Camp VI, send the Sherpas down, and attempt the summit next day. The second party of Franco and Magnone would use Camp VI overnight before trying for the summit or, if the first party had turned back, would pitch a higher Camp VII at  and attempt the summit the day after. If these attempts failed, a team of Bouvier, Coup\u00e9, Leroux and Vialatte would try, succeeded a day later by a second attempt by the first four climbers. The twelve strongest Sherpas would provide support, using oxygen above Camp V whereas the French climbers would use it above Camp IV. Lapras, the doctor, ascended to Camp III and Vialatte was to be temporarily in charge of the expedition until Franco himself returned safely.\n\nOver the next few days progress went very much according to plan. On 11 May, as Franco and his team started their ascent from Camp I, he was surprised to find Gyalzen Norbu going down. He was in Franco's own summit team and yet was descending from Camp II. It turned out Gyalzen Norbu was just going down to Camp I to say goodbye to his wife and would be back up at Camp II by first thing next morning. He was wearing his high-altitude clothes \u2013 a padded suit trimmed with fur \u2013 so Franco guessed this was to impress his wife.\n\nOn 13 May Couzy and Terray reached the Col while Franco and his team gained Camp IV where, unusually, the wind had dropped completely and overnight the temperature had fallen to . On 14 May two of the five Sherpas on the Col, who were scheduled to help establish Camp VI, were unfit to go on so the lead climbers went ahead with only three very heavily laden Sherpas in gales that had helped to blow clear loose snow. They successfully pitched a tent at  and the Sherpas set off down. The wind had dropped and the snow underfoot was in good condition. When Franco reached Camp V on 14 May he sent the two ill Sherpas down with one of his own Sherpas but soon the three Sherpas descending from Camp VI turned up in an exhausted and distressed state. After they had recovered somewhat it emerged that all three had taken a fall of over  but the details never became clear. They could not stay at Camp V and Franco felt forced to send them on down to Camp IV for the night. At the end of the day the weather forecast came through predicting fine weather over the whole chain of mountains.\n\nOn 15 May 1955, after a night when the temperature had reached , the weather was indeed fine and clear as Couzy and Terray reached the summit. It was the most pointed snow summit Couzy had ever seen, \"just like a pencil point\" and with a knife-edged ridge leading there. When descending they crossed with Franco's team at Camp VI in \"a moment of supreme joy\". A second tent was pitched at Camp VI and Franco invited Gyalzen Norbu to join with him and Magnone in trying for the summit next day and for Da Norbu to stay at Camp VI to support their return. To help the others next day, that night Da Norbu voluntarily slept without using his oxygen.\n\nFor Franco, his summit day went perfectly and on the summit the weather was so calm that he, Magnone and Gyalzen Norbu stayed for a long time. The summit was so sharp all three could only stand on it together when belayed with their ice axes. Only the highest peaks could be seen above a layer of cloud but they could see Chamlang, Kangchenjunga (over  away) and Everest. Franco accidentally let his camera slip and it fell down the south face beyond a line of rocks about  below. The loss of the camera was not so important but all thirty-five photographs taken on the ascent were gone. To Gyalzen Norbu's horror Franco was let down on a rope held by Magnone to where he managed to retrieve the camera. They had planted French and Nepalese flags on the summit but they took them back down with them to leave the mountain without festoons. Between Camps V and VI they met the third, reserve, party who had climbed all the way up from Camp III in one day using oxygen continuously. They also were to experience the finest climb of their lives when they reached the summit next day.\n\nThey all celebrated back at Base Camp by firing their unused distress flares into the air as a violent wind blew monsoon clouds across the sky.\n\nAssessment\nThe expedition marked the first time on an eight-thousand foot mountain that the entire team of climbers had reached the summit. The American Alpine Journal thought Franco deserved high praise for his excellent organisation supported by splendid equipment. R.R.E. Chorley, writing in the Alpine Journal, considered that the reason the expedition had no adventures was because it had been so well conducted. Their luck with the weather was to disguise the importance of good leadership and careful planning. Franco unobtrusively managed seven very individualistic climbers in a way that led to them following a coherent plan and to do so happily. Chorley thought that without supplementary oxygen perhaps only one pair would have reached the summit and so oxygen was a positive asset to the enjoyment of the expedition.

He is an influential postcolonial scholar, considered one of the first to bring both psychoanalysis and postcolonial analysis to the field of Development Studies. He is the author of five books and numerous articles on postcolonial politics, psychoanalysis, participatory development, and celebrity humanitarianism.\n\nWork on participation \nKapoor first came to prominence in the early 2000s through a series of influential journal articles on participatory development (the practice of involving beneficiaries of international development programs in decision-making).  Kapoor is critical of such a practice, arguing that while it looks noble and promising (when adopted by the World Bank or any other international agency), it is often an excuse to further neoliberal policies, and can even result in authoritarian and exclusionary practices. In 2004, Kapoor's critique helped frame an issue of Current Issues in Comparative Education (published at Columbia University).\n\nWork on postcolonialism \nKapoor's 2008 book, The Postcolonial Politics of Development, is a collection of essays written between 2002-2007. The book is one of the first to analyze development issues from a postcolonial perspective. It has received many positive reviews. Kapoor examines recent international development policy areas (governance, human/gender rights, participation), carrying out a cultural and political economy critique of them. He argues that development practitioners and westernized elites are often complicit in perpetuating contemporary forms of imperialism. The book concludes by arguing for the need for a radical self-reflexivity on the part of development workers, institutions and academics; while at the same time emphasizing the political strategies of marginalized groups that can lead to greater democratic dialogue.\n\nIlan Kapoor is the brother of artist Anish Kapoor. The latter has designed the book covers for Kapoor's 2008, 2020 and 2021 books.\n\nIn September 2017, Kapoor resigned as editorial board member of the journal Third World Quarterly (along with roughly half of the journal's editorial board members) in protest against the journal publishing an article making a \"case for colonialism.\"\n\nWork on celebrity humanitarianism \nKapoor's book, Celebrity Humanitarianism: The Ideology of Global Charity (2012), is one of the first to critically assess the relatively new phenomenon of global celebrity philanthropy (by the likes of Bono, Geldof, Angelina Jolie, Madonna, Bill Gates, George Soros). The author carries out a stinging critique of celebrity charity work and corporate philanthropy. He shows how this charity is not just self-promoting, but also helps justify and worsen the global inequality brought about by capitalism. Kapoor also draws attention to what he sees as a new phenomenon of \"spectacular NGOs,\" not-for-profit development organizations such as Save Darfur or Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders) that don\u2019t just get celebrity endorsements but seek out celebrity status themselves. He takes them to task for being more interested in branding, spectacle and short-term results than addressing broader and long-term problems of social inequality and political inclusion.\n\nWork on psychoanalytic politics \nKapoor's books, Confronting Desire: Psychoanalysis and International Development (2020) and Psychoanalysis and the GlObal (2018), investigate how the unconscious \"speaks out\" in various guises: from obsessions about growth and poverty to the perverse seductions of racism and over-consumption, from disavowal of the climate crisis to the social and cultural traumas engendered by globalization. For Kapoor, the unpredictability and excess of unconscious desire are not only the source of \"irrationality\" but also a political resource for breaking out of the global capitalist status quo. He examines, for example, the political and psychoanalytic bases of revolutionary movements such as the Arab Spring.\n\nKapoor's book Universal Politics (2021), co-authored with Zahi Zalloua, argues for a negative universality rooted in social antagonism (shared experiences of marginalization) and envisions a common solidarity of the excluded. For the authors, such a conception of universality avoids the trap of neocolonial universalism and the narrow particularism of identity politics. The book examines what a universal politics could look like in such key current global sites of struggle as climate change, workers' struggles, the Palestinian question, the refugee crisis, Black Lives Matter, #MeToo, political Islam, Morales's universalist state in Bolivia, the European Union, and COVID-19.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPersonal Website\nFaculty Profile at York University\n Academia.edu Profile\n Kapoor-Wheeler debate, \"Should celebrities promote charities?\" in New Internationalist 1 September 2012\n\n1959 births\nLiving people\nCanadian Jews\nCanadian people of Indian descent\nAcademic staff of York University\nEnvironmental studies scholars", "Michael Arthur DeGerick (born April 1, 1943) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.

The injury cost DeGerick the entire 1963 season and he only pitched in three more minor league games in 1964 before leaving baseball.\n\nBorn in New York City, DeGerick signed a $50,000 bonus contract with the White Sox in June 1961 after graduation from high school in nearby Teaneck, New Jersey. He won nine of 11 decisions in the Class D Appalachian League during his rookie campaign, then was recalled to the White Sox in September 1961. In his MLB debut against the Minnesota Twins, DeGerick relieved Russ Kemmerer in the fourth inning with the Twins in the midst of a six-run rally. DeGerick surrendered one earned run and two hits in 1\u2154 innings of work. It was his last action of the season. The following year, after a solid season in Class A (a 12\u20138 record with a 2.89 earned run average), DeGerick was recalled again for a late-season look and, again facing the Twins, he allowed one hit and no runs in an inning of relief.\n\nHe was in Sarasota, Florida, preparing to start the 1963 season in Double-A for the White Sox when he was injured by the line drive and underwent surgery.

He was signed by the Baltimore Colts as an undrafted free agent in 1972. He played college football at Wyoming.\n\nHe was the older brother of Chuck Muncie who also played in the NFL for the New Orleans Saints and San Diego Chargers.\n\nEarly years\nAfter he starred as a running back at Uniontown Area High School in his hometown, Munsey switched to defensive back when he played at the University of Wyoming. Munsey's football career got a jump start when began to play for the Norfolk Neptunes in 1969.  It was while playing for the Neptunes that he met Vivian Seaborne, the first black cheerleader for the Norfolk Neptunes.\n\nProfessional career\nMunsey had two touchdowns, seven interceptions and five fumble recoveries in 72 games with the Colts, all at right cornerback. His first touchdown was scored in his rookie year on a three-yard fumble recovery return in the first quarter of a 24\u201321 road loss to the San Francisco 49ers on November 12, 1972. His other one came in the fourth quarter on December 21, 1975 when he intercepted a Steve Grogan pass and returned it thirty yards to clinch a regular-season-ending 34\u201321 home victory over the New England Patriots and the first of three consecutive American Football Conference (AFC) Eastern Division championships for the Colts.\n\nThe 1975 season was the only one in his career in which Munsey started all the games played by the Colts.

It is part of the Olympic Mountains and is situated at the western end of Hurricane Ridge within the Daniel J. Evans Wilderness. Hurricane Hill is nine miles south-southwest of Port Angeles and two miles northwest of the park's Hurricane Ridge Visitor Center. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains to the Elwha River via various tributaries. Topographic relief is significant as the southwest aspect rises  above the Elwha Valley in three miles.\n\nHistory\nThis landform was originally christened \"Mt. Eldridge\" by the 1889-90 Seattle Press Expedition, for William C. Eldridge, a journalist from Washington D.C. Early pioneers of the area referred to the mountain as \"Old Hurricane\" because of hurricane-force winds in winter, and in 1897 it was named Hurricane Hill by prospector W. A. Hall who climbed it from the Elwha Valley on a particularly windy day. During World War II, a 13' by 13' observation cabin was constructed at the top for the Aircraft Warning Service and was manned by wildlife cinematographer Herb Crisler and his wife in 1942\u201343. The lookout has since been removed, while Dodger Point and Pyramid Peak Lookouts are the only stations remaining in Olympic National Park of the thirteen that were constructed.\n\nClimate\n\nBased on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Hurricane Hill is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Olympic Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Olympic Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall (Orographic lift). As a result, the Olympics experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.\n\nRecreation\n\nFrom the end of the Hurricane Ridge Road, a 1.6-mile trail leads to the top of Hurricane Hill. This paved trail was originally a Forest Service road built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The relatively easy and popular hike gains approximately 750 feet of elevation and is snow-free from late June to October. The trail was refurbished in 2020. In winter, Hurricane Hill becomes a favorite destination with snowshoers. There is also a six-mile trail on the west side which climbs up from the Elwha Valley and gains 5,100 feet of elevation. From the north side, the Little River Trail climbs 4,700 feet over seven miles before intersecting with the paved Hurricane Hill trail. The summit offers views of the Bailey Range, Mount Olympus, Victoria on Vancouver Island across the Strait of Juan de Fuca, and on clear days one can see Mount Baker 95 miles distant. Hurricane Hill is considered one of the best wildflower hikes in Washington state with over 125 species of plants, with the peak time for wildflowers in July and August.\n\nFlora and fauna\nHurricane Hill hosts lupine, mountain pasqueflower, mountain dandelion, rosy pussytoes, nodding arnica, Olympic Mountain aster, western mugwort, common harebell, paintprush, mountain larkspur and rockslide larkspur. Old-growth forests of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and western redcedar grow on the lower slopes surrounding the peak. Deer, grouse, chipmunks, and marmots may be encountered on the meadow slopes. Colonies of the Olympic marmot are found only in the Olympic Mountains and nowhere else in the world, but their population has declined due to non-native coyote predation. However, they continue to thrive on Hurricane Hill which makes it the best place to see and photograph them.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n Weather forecast: Hurricane Hill\n Hurricane Ridge webcam: NPS.gov\n\nOlympic Mountains\nMountains of Washington (state)\nMountains of Clallam County, Washington\nLandforms of Olympic National Park\nNorth American 1000 m summits", "Michael Gigante (born June 27, 1969) is an American record producer, songwriter and composer.

Bison\u00f3 was a member of the Social Christian Reformist Party, and he has been Second Vice President of the Dominican-Haitian Chamber of Commerce.\n\nEarly life and education \nIto Bison\u00f3 was born in Santo Domingo, and is the son of architect Victor Bison\u00f3 Pichardo, born into a prominent family from Villa Bison\u00f3 in Santiago, and Ivonne Haza, a renowned national soprano from San Pedro de Macor\u00eds. He completed grade school at Colegio Santa Teresita and his undergraduate studies at the Universidad Iberoamericana (UNIBE), achieving his degree in Business Management. He also completed some courses in Engineering at the Universidad Nacional Pedro Henr\u00edquez Ure\u00f1a.\n\nBison\u00f3 is descended from Domingo Daniel Pichardo, Vice President of the Dominican Republic from 1857 to 1858, and Fernando Valerio, who is considered a hero of the Battle of Santiago (1844).\n\nEntering politics \nBison\u00f3 joined the Social Christian Reformist Party in the early 1980s when it was in the opposition after having been in government for 12 years with its leader Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer. The Dominican Revolutionary Party seemed unstoppable at the time after beating the PRSC by wide margins in 1978 and 1982 with Antonio Guzm\u00e1n and Salvador Jorge Blanco respectively. Ito did not come from a political family and what connections his family did have were actually with the PRD rather than the reformists as his mother was a singing coach for President Guzman and during the government of Salvador Jorge Blanco both mother and father were part of the administration as Director of the National Theatre and the Patronage of Bellas Artes respectively. However he developed a conservative or classical liberal ideology that did not fit in with the PRD, a member of Socialist International.\n\nHe along with many other young members of the PRSC were very active and influential in Balaguer's victory at the 1986 Dominican Republic general election. This new government was essentially different from the previous 12 years since the Cold War was nearing its end and political confrontation between the Dominican left and right was now strictly political as opposed to armed conflict. Many new faces joined Balaguer, and Ito became one of them.\n\nGovernment work \nBison\u00f3 had many different positions during Balaguer's 10 years of government which included being assistant to the Secretary of Public Works, assistant of the administrator of the Dominican Corporation of Electricity (where he became well known to the public), assistant of the Dominican Council for Promotion of Foreign Investment and spokesperson of at the Administrative Board of the Dominican Marble Industry.\n\nCongress\nIn 1998 he won internal primaries to become candidate for deputy representing his party but the PRSC was in deep crisis and only gained 2 seats in Santo Domingo and 17 nationwide that year. This was during a time when the election to the Chamber of Deputies was done using Closed party lists. Although he had won the primaries with 16,000 votes, he was placed at number 10 which effectively crippled his chances. He however kept campaigning not so much for himself but for the party and then again in the presidential election of 2000, when Balaguer entered the race one last time and had an excellent showing considering his late entry to the race and divided party. The party was 2nd place overall and 3rd place taking into account the political alliance between the Dominican Liberation Party and the Bloque Institucional Social D\u00e9mocrata. For the 2002 elections with the party more united than in 1998 and with the recently created preferential vote which allowed the electorate to cast their vote for any candidate from the party list, Bison\u00f3 joined the Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic after having received 4,667 votes in a universe of 60,000.\n\nBison\u00f3 became one of the more well known faces of his party in that period which lead to him being elected party spokesperson for 2002\u20132003 during which time he led various opposition measures against the majority PRD and even received the support of the PLD at times. This made him viable candidate for President of the Lower Chamber for which he received the support of over a dozen fellow congressmen. A very impressionable feat for a freshman.\n\nDuring this first term in office he was voted in unanimously as member of the National Council of the Magistrate which is the board that appoints the judges of the Dominican Supreme Court of Justice. 25 deputies from all 3 main parties gave him their support.\n\nIn congress he is a member of the following committees: Finance, Human Rights, Public Works, Energy, Mining and Dominicans abroad.\n\nHe was re-elected for a second term in congress after the 2006 election and was the only winning candidate of the PRSC in the Dominican capital and then again in 2010 this time as the candidate with the most votes.\n\nEnvironmental work \nBecause of his role in defending the environment of the Dominican Republic, Bison\u00f3 has become the representative of eco-friendly Dominicans in Congress. He has sponsored many events to decrease pollution, fumigate areas affected by infested lagoons, tree planting sprees as well as presenting many comprehensive pieces of legislation concerning environmental conservation and climate change.\n\nRole in the PRSC \nAlthough Ito was very active in his support of Eduardo Estrella inside the PRSC, when the latter left the party the former decided to stay. Not being a member of any of the warring factions within his party has allowed him to become one of its more popular members.\n\nSince party leader Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer's death in 2002, the party has seen many divisions. The most controversial was the one caused by the 2003 primaries which resulted in Eduardo Estrella winning over former Vice-President Jacinto Peynado. There were accusations that Estrella was sponsored by Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda and this caused many members to ally with the Dominican Liberation Party and its candidate Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez.\n\nThese division caused strong defeats for the party and especially so in the 2008 election in which the party did not pass the 5% threshold in orden to stay a majority party. This led Congressman Bison\u00f3 to call for party renewal and he aspired to become President of the PRSC for which great support was received nationwide. However, after the return of those who had allied themselves with Fernandez, the presidency was handed to Carlos Morales Troncoso as a result of Amable Aristy Castro jumping out of the race and throwing his support to behind the Foreign Minister. Ito was finally named to the collegiate Permanent Presidential Commission of the party as one of the 13 members than compose it.\n\nInitially supporting Carlos Morales, he began to drift apart after it became clear that the new party leader was very committed to the governing PLD and party members who did not want a first round alliance with Danilo Medina asked him to run for the Presidency in representation of the PRSC as a way to assure an independent position. Even before all this, he had appeared as a very strong third candidate in a Gallup poll with a respectable 9 percent behind Morales with 14. After announcing and beginning his campaign in late March, he quickly surpassed him and polled 19% in Gallup while Morales still had 14 and then 20% in Penn Schoen Berland effectively displacing the former second place holder who now polled 8%. Amable Aristy was first place in all of these but he has not indicated intention of running.\n\nPersonal life \nHe is married to Isabel M. Le\u00f3n Nouel (the daughter of Guillermo Le\u00f3n Asensio and Mercedes Nouel Victoria; Isabel is niece of Jos\u00e9 Le\u00f3n Asensio, granddaughter of Eduardo Le\u00f3n Jimenes and Carlos Tom\u00e1s Nouel y Bobadilla, and therefore grandniece of Adolfo Alejandro Nouel y Bobadilla) with whom he has 3 children: Andr\u00e9s Guillermo, Daniela Isabel and Diego Orlando Bison\u00f3 Le\u00f3n.\n\nAncestors\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Personal site\n\nMembers of the Chamber of Deputies of the Dominican Republic\nSocial Christian Reformist Party politicians\nLiving people\n1963 births\nDominican Republic people of Basque descent\nDominican Republic people of Canarian descent\nDominican Republic people of Cuban descent\nDominican Republic people of French descent\nDominican Republic people of Spanish descent\nWhite Dominicans", "Veronika V\u00edtkov\u00e1 (; born on 9 December 1988) is a Czech former biathlete.

Like Edward Sapir and Otto Jespersen, he collaborated with Alice Vanderbilt Morris to develop the research program of the International Auxiliary Language Association (IALA). From 1936 to 1939, he was Research Director of IALA. Under Collinson's guidance, methods of compiling international word material were tested at Liverpool. In 1939 IALA moved from Liverpool to New York and E. Clark Stillman succeeded Collinson as Research Director.

Nor does the seller hold any option of the same class on the same underlying security that could protect against potential losses (like in an options spread). A naked option involving a \"call\" is called a \"naked call\" or \"uncovered call\", while one involving a \"put\" is a \"naked put\" or \"uncovered put\".\n\nThe naked option is one of riskiest options strategies, and therefore most brokers restrict them to only those traders that have the highest options level approval and have a margin account. Naked option are attractive because the seller receives the premium cost of the option without buying a corresponding position to hedge against potential losses. In the case of a naked put, the seller hopes that the underlying equity or stock price stays the same or rises. In the case of a naked call, the seller hopes that the underlying equity or stock price stays the same or drops. And the seller's odds of retaining the premium at expiration increase the further the naked option is out of the money at the time it was written.\n\nSelling a naked option could also be used as an alternative to using a limit order or stop order to open an equity position. Instead of buying an underlying stock outright, one with sufficient cash could sell a put option, receive the premium, and then buy the stock if its price drops to or below the strike price at assignment or expiration. Likewise, one with sufficient equity to borrow on margin could sell a call option, receive the premium, and then short the stock if its price rises to or above the strike price at assignment or expiration.\n\nHowever, the naked option has the highest risk because sellers have agreed to cover the contract in case of assignment, no matter how far the price of the stock goes. The seller of a naked put would be obligated to purchase the underlying stock at the strike price even if its market price drops down to zero. Likewise, the seller of a naked call could be forced to short the underlying stock at the strike price even if its market price rises up to an unlimited amount. Because nothing is covered to protect against potential losses, a margin call would be triggered if the seller does not have enough equity or cash to cover the contract in case of assignment.\n\nExamples\n\nNaked call example\nShares of XYZ is currently selling at $85 per share and Speculator A decides to sell a call option at a strike price of $100 per share on or before May 10 for $24. If the XYZ shares fail to rise above $100 before May 10, the call option expires worthless and Speculator A makes a profit of $24. However, if the XYZ shares rise above $100, Speculator A would be obligated to buy 100 shares of XYZ at market price and sell them back for $100 each. In this scenario, the Speculator A makes a loss of (100 * XYZ market price) - (100 * $100) - $24. As market price can rise an unlimited amount, Speculator A can experience unlimited losses in this 'worst case' scenario.\n\nNaked put example\nShares of XYZ is currently selling at $85 per share and Speculator A decides to sell a put option at a strike price of $75 per share on or before June 17 for $24. If the XYZ shares fail to drop below $75 before June 10, the put option expires worthless and Speculator A makes a profit of $24. However, if the XYZ shares drop at or below $75, Speculator A would be obligated to buy 100 shares of XYZ at a price of $75, even if the market price drops at or near $0.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nMark D.

It was introduced into service with the US Navy SEALs in 1995. It was removed from service in 2013.\n\nIt is commonly referred to as the \"Mark V.1 Patrol Boat\" in official U.S. Navy documents.\n\nDevelopment\n\nOrigins\nThe development of the Mark V SOC was very fast-paced, taking only 18 months from the initiation of the program to the actual delivery of the first boat on September 4th 1995. The United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) Contracting Directorate and a dedicated Program Management team executed this effort in record time, specifically because USSOCOM was given Agency level contracting authority. The contract was fulfilled when the full operational capability was met in 1999. In all, 20 Mk V SOC units were delivered to USSOCOM at a unit cost of $3.7\u00a0million.\n\nThe Mark V SOC deployment was less smooth.  Problems included instances of the windshield and entire pilothouse assembly collapsing upon wave impact. However, these issues have been resolved and the Mark V SOC has greatly improved maritime special operations capabilities.\n\nThe original Mk V SOC was designed to address the lack of any specifically conceived SEAL insertion craft. Prior to the Mk V SOC, SEALs traveled on any form of surface transport available, often resorting to taping lawn furniture to the available craft's deck. The original Mk V competition included three different designs, one Kevlar composite monohull, one aluminum monohull, and one aluminum catamaran hull; the aluminum monohull won. The Mk V SOC specifically incorporated a modular shock mitigation seating design to minimize injury.\n\nExperience gained during training and operational usage showed the aluminum monohull transmitted the impact with the water to the craft's occupants more readily than a composite hull. Even after modifications such as the addition of shock-absorbing seats, the boats are capable of generating up to 20 Gs of force while slamming across waves. This led to many cases of bruises, sprained ankles, chipped teeth, and back, neck, and joint injuries. These injuries necessitated a replacement.\n\nRedesign\nOn 11 January 2008 the U.S. Navy unveiled an experimental version of the Mark V Special Operations Craft, designated the Mk V.1, designed to reduce the number of injuries sustained by sailors and SEALs during the operation of the aluminum version of the vessel. Nicknamed the MAKO, the vessel was developed by a subsidiary of Hodgdon Yachts, in collaboration with the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered Wood Composites Center. It features a hull made of layers of carbon fiber, a foam core, and an outer layer of Kevlar for additional strength. It was constructed and launched at the Hodgdon Yachts' East Boothbay facility. The MAKO is lighter than the current Mk V. The Office of Naval Research funded the prototype \"to compare the properties of composite construction with aluminum\" versions of the same craft. The tests did not suggest continuing the vessel with a composite structure. Instead, the decision was to retire the Mark V in 2013 in favor of its replacements.\n\nThe Mark V was replaced in 2015 by several craft: the Combatant-Craft Assault (CCA), Combatant-Craft Medium (CCM MK1), and Combat-Craft Heavy (CCH MK1) SEALION (SEAL Insertion, Observation and Neutralization).\n\nMissions\nThe Mark V's primary mission is medium range insertion and extraction platform for Special Operations Forces (primarily SEAL combat swimmers) in a low to medium threat environment. The secondary mission is limited Coastal Patrol and Interdiction, specifically limited duration patrol and low to medium threat coastal interdiction. The typical Mark V SOC mission duration is 12 hours.\n\nFor example, in 2003, in one of the first actions of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Mark V SOCs operating out of Kuwait disembarked at least two platoons of Navy SEALs to capture Iraqi offshore oil terminals.\n\nCapabilities\n\nThe Mark V has the capacity to carry sixteen fully equipped SEALs to missions  away from where they are based. They ride on seats that are designed for maximum comfort and shock mitigation in high seas or heavy maneuvering, and allows occupants to either stand or sit. With a beam of 17\u00bd feet, the craft has enough room to carry four Combat Rubber Raiding Crafts with six outboard motors (2 spares) and fuel, to deploy forces from a clandestine distance. The ramp on the stern allows SEAL teams to ride their CRRCs right up the stern of the boat, for fast extraction and insertion.\n\nTo support the SOF missions in a medium to low threat environment, the Mk Vs are outfitted with five gun mounts for small caliber weapons supporting any combination of: M-2 .50 cal heavy machine guns, M240 or the M60 7.62\u00a0mm machine guns or Mk19 40 mm automatic grenade launchers. Together these provide 360 degrees of firing coverage. To defend against aircraft, the craft has a station for firing the Stinger Man-portable Air Defense System (MANPADS). Later improvements include mounting stations for GAU-17 Miniguns, MK 95 Twin .50 cal machine gun, MK 38 chain gun and Mk48 25\u00a0mm guns. Personal small arms of the crew and passengers can also be used to defend the craft.\n\nThe Mark V has many special features, besides its weapons, that make it more survivable while delivering sailors to their missions. Its angular design and low silhouette reduces its radar signature making it harder to spot and detect. Its V-hull design gives it good handling qualities in rough water as well as speed and shallow draft (four feet when cruising on-step). Its twin MTU 12-cylinder TE94 Diesel engines give it power and reliability and, coupled with the two K50S water jets, provides fast acceleration for operations near shore or in shallow waters as well as cutting down on the rooster tail effect that can make fast boats easier to see and track.\n\nMark V SOC Detachment\nThe Mark V SOC will normally operate in a two craft detachment with a Mobile Support Team. The operational detachment\u2014the basic Mark V SOC operating system\u2014consists of:\n two Mark V special operations craft, each with a crew of five special warfare combatant-craft crewmen (also known as SWCCs);\n two Mark V SOC transporters, each with an M916A1E1 prime mover\n four M1097 HMMWVs with S250 shelters,\n two M1083 5-ton trucks for the 90-day containerized deployment support package (spare part, repair parts, consumables, etc.)\n one five-ton forklift;\n an eight-man maintenance support team, that provides technical assistance and maintenance support during mission turnaround.\n\nA Mark V SOC detachment is deployable on two USAF C-5 Galaxy aircraft to a theater of operations within 48 hours of notification and is prepared to commence operations within 24 hours after arriving at a forward staging location. The detachment can also be delivered in-theater by well or flight deck equipped surface ships with appropriate crane and deck space capabilities, and, if appropriate, under their own power. A detachment is also transportable by road.\n\nThe Mark V SOC is operated by Naval Special Warfare Group THREE (formerly known as Special Boat Squadron ONE) and Naval Special Warfare Group FOUR (formerly known as Special Boat Squadron TWO) on the east and west coasts. Twelve Mark Vs are assigned to NSWG-3, Coronado, California, and eight to NSWG-4, Little Creek, Virginia.\n\nMark V Waterfront Operations Support Facility\nLocated at Naval Air Station North Island, San Diego, California is a facility to house operational maintenance, training and administrative functions for 12 Mark V SOC. The North Island location was designed to allow rapid mobilization and transport of these vessel worldwide. The facility provides non-depot level maintenance of rolling stock and depot level maintenance of the Mark V SOC. In addition to maintenance and supply/spare parts warehousing facilities, on-site administration and training facilities with classrooms and briefing areas were provided.\n\nFinal design includes a new 115' by 37' U-shaped, reinforced concrete pier, 60' long concrete floating docks to berth five vessels, and a gangway. The pier was designed to support the combined load of a 50-ton Mark V and a 70-ton marine travel lift used to lift the vessels out of the water and transport them to the maintenance facility.\n\nThe Support Facility building is Bldg 816 on Naval Air Station North Island, next to the Undersea Rescue Command compound. The project as executed does not seem to have included the dock and pier where shown in the planning documents. The facility is still is use, now apparently supporting CCM and other NSW craft.\n\nForeign use\nIn 2009, the Kuwait Naval Force signed a $61.6-million contract with United States Marine, Inc. of Gulfport, MS for the design and construction of ten Mark V patrol boats under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program for coastal interdiction, and special operations for delivery by June 2013.\n\nOn 9 July 2013, Congress was notified of a request from the Royal Saudi Naval Forces to purchase 30 Mark V patrol boats, along with associated equipment, parts, training, and logistical support for $1.2 billion.  The boats' mission is to protect maritime infrastructure in Saudi littoral waters.  They will be used primarily to patrol and interdict intruders in Saudi territorial seas, and recognized economic exclusion zones.\n\nFour boats were delivered to Greece via the Excess Defense Articles programme on 6 April 2020 and are currently in use by the Underwater Demolition Command of the Hellenic Navy.\n\nSee also\n \n Special Operations Craft - Riverine (SOC-R)\n \nMark VI patrol boat\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMilitary.com\nGlobalsecurity.org\nSpecial-operations-technology.com\n\nUnited States Navy SEALs\nEquipment of the United States Navy\nUnclassified miscellaneous vessels of the United States Navy\nMilitary boats\nRiverine warfare\nPatrol vessels of the United States Navy\nPatrol boat classes", "August Gottschalk (Essen, 14 December 1921 \u2013 Essen, 27 November 2014) was a German footballer who played as a forward.\n\nBiography \nHe debuted professionally in 1939 with Rot-Weiss Essen.

He is the subject of Life of Apollonius of Tyana, written by Philostratus over a century after his death.\n\nLife dates\nApollonius was born into a respected and wealthy Greek household. His primary biographer, Philostratus the Elder (circa 170c. 247), places him circa 3\u00a0BCc.\u00a097 AD, however, the Roman historian Cassius Dio (c.\u2009155 \u2013 c.\u2009235 AD) writes that Apollonius was in his 40s or 50s in the 90s AD, from which the scholar, Maria Dzielska gives a birth year of about 40 AD.\n\nSources \nThe earliest and by far the most detailed source is the Life of Apollonius of Tyana, a lengthy, novelistic biography written by the sophist Philostratus at the request of empress Julia Domna. She died in 217\u00a0AD and he completed it after her death, probably in the 220s or 230s\u00a0AD. Philostratus's account shaped the image of Apollonius for posterity. To some extent it is a valuable source because it contains data from older writings that were available to Philostratus but disappeared later on. Among these works are an excerpt (preserved by Eusebius) from On Sacrifices, and certain alleged letters of Apollonius. The sage may have actually written some of these works, along with the no-longer extant Biography of Pythagoras. At least two biographical sources that Philostratus used are lost: a book by the imperial secretary Maximus describing Apollonius's activities in Maximus's home city of Aegaeae in Aeolis and a biography by a certain Moiragenes. There also survives, separately from the life by Philostratus, a collection of letters of Apollonius, but at least some of these seem to be spurious.\n\nOne of the essential sources Philostratus claimed to know are the \u201cmemoirs\u201d (or \u201cdiary\u201d) of Damis, an acolyte and companion of Apollonius. Some scholars claim that the notebooks of Damis were an invention of Philostratus, while others think it could have been a real book forged by someone else and naively used by Philostratus. Philostratus describes Apollonius as a wandering teacher of philosophy and miracle-worker who was mainly active in Greece and Asia Minor but also traveled to Italy, Spain, and North Africa, and even to Mesopotamia, India, and Ethiopia. In particular, he tells lengthy stories of Apollonius entering the city of Rome in disregard of emperor Nero's ban on philosophers, and later on being summoned, as a defendant, to the court of Domitian, where he defied the emperor in blunt terms. He had allegedly been accused of conspiring against the emperor, performing human sacrifice, and predicting a plague by means of magic. Philostratus implies that upon his death, Apollonius of Tyana underwent heavenly assumption.\n\nHow much of this can be accepted as historical truth depends largely on the extent to which modern scholars trust Philostratus, and in particular on whether they believe in the reality of Damis. Some of these scholars contend that Apollonius never came to Western Europe and was virtually unknown there until the 3rd\u00a0century\u00a0AD, when Empress Julia Domna, who was herself from the province of Syria, decided to popularize him and his teachings in Rome. For that purpose, so these same scholars believe, she commissioned Philostratus to write the biography, in which Apollonius is exalted as a fearless sage with supernatural powers, even greater than Pythagoras. This view of Julia Domna's role in the making of the Apollonius legend gets some support from the fact that her son Caracalla worshipped him, and her grandnephew emperor Severus Alexander may have done so as well.\n\nApollonius was also a known figure in the Islamic world.\n\nBiography\n\nHistorical facts\nWith the exception of the Adana Inscription from 3rd or 4th century AD, little can be derived from sources other than Philostratus.\n\nThe Adana Inscription has been translated by C.P. Jones as: \"This man, named after Apollo, and shining forth from Tyana, extinguished the faults of men. The tomb in Tyana (received) his body, but in truth heaven received him so that he might drive out the pains of men (or: drive pains from among men).\" It is thought to have been brought from Cilicia, perhaps Aegae (Cilicia). However, Miroslav Marcovich translates part of the text as: \"Sure enough, Apollonius was born in Tyana, but the full truth is that he was a heaven-sent sage and healer, a new Pythagoras\"\n\nAs James Francis put it, \"the most that can be said ... is that Apollonius appears to have been a wandering ascetic/philosopher/wonderworker of a type common to the eastern part of the early empire.\" What we can safely assume is that he was indeed a Pythagorean and as such, in conformity with the Pythagorean tradition, opposed animal sacrifice and lived on a frugal, strictly vegetarian diet. A minimalist view is that he spent his entire life in the cities of his native Asia Minor (Turkey) and of northern Syria, in particular his home town of Tyana, Ephesus, Aegae and Antioch, though the letters suggest wider travels, and there seems no reason to deny that, like many wandering philosophers, he at least visited Rome. As for his philosophical convictions, we have an interesting, probably authentic fragment of one of his writings (On sacrifices), in which he expresses his view that God, who is the most beautiful being, cannot be influenced by prayers or sacrifices and has no wish to be worshipped by humans, but can be reached by a spiritual procedure involving nous (intellect), because he himself is pure nous, and nous is the greatest faculty of humankind.\n\nMiracles \nPhilostratus implies on one occasion that Apollonius had extra-sensory perception (Book VIII, Chapter XXVI). When emperor Domitian was murdered on 18\u00a0September 96\u00a0AD, Apollonius was said to have witnessed the event in Ephesus \"about midday\" on the day it happened in Rome, and told those present \"Take heart, gentlemen, for the tyrant has been slain this day\u00a0...\". Both Philostratus and renowned historian Cassius Dio report this incident, probably on the basis of an oral tradition. Both state that the philosopher welcomed the deed as praiseworthy tyrannicide.\n\nJourney to India \nPhilostratus devoted two and a half of the eight books of his Life of Apollonius (1.19\u20133.58) to the description of a journey of his hero to India. According to Philostratus' Life, en route to the Far East, Apollonius reached Hierapolis Bambyce (Manbij) in Syria (not Nineveh, as some scholars believed), where he met Damis, a native of that city who became his lifelong companion. Pythagoras, whom the Neo-Pythagoreans regarded as an exemplary sage, was believed to have traveled to India. Hence such a feat made Apollonius look like a good Pythagorean who spared no pains in his efforts to discover the sources of oriental piety and wisdom. As some details in Philostratus\u2019 account of the Indian adventure seem incompatible with known facts, modern scholars are inclined to dismiss the whole story as a fanciful fabrication, but not all of them rule out the possibility that the Tyanean actually did visit India. Philostratus has him meet Phraotes, the Indo-Parthian king of Taxila, a city located in northern Ancient India in what is now northern Pakistan, around 46 AD. And the description that Philostratus provides of Taxila comports with modern archaeological excavations at the ancient site.\n\nWhat seemed to be independent evidence showing that Apollonius was known in India has now been proven a forgery. In two Sanskrit texts quoted by Sanskritist Vidhushekhara Bhattacharya in 1943 he appears as \"Apal\u016bnya\", in one of them together with Damis (called \"Dam\u012b\u015ba\"), it is claimed that Apollonius and Damis were Western yogis, who later on were converted to the correct Advaita philosophy. Some have believed that these Indian sources derived their information from a Sanskrit translation of Philostratus\u2019 work (which would have been a most uncommon and amazing occurrence), or even considered the possibility that it was really an independent confirmation of the historicity of the journey to India. Only in 1995 were the passages in the Sanskrit texts proven to be interpolations by a late 19th-century forger.\n\nWritings \nSeveral writings and many letters have been ascribed to Apollonius, but some of them are lost; others have only been preserved in parts or fragments of disputed authenticity. Porphyry and Iamblichus refer to a biography of Pythagoras by Apollonius, which has not survived; it is also mentioned in the Suda. Apollonius wrote a treatise, On sacrifices, of which only a short, probably authentic fragment has come down to us.\n\nPhilostratus' Life and the anthology assembled by Joannes Stobaeus contain purported letters of Apollonius. Some of them are cited in full, others only partially. There is also an independently transmitted collection of letters preserved in medieval manuscripts. It is difficult to determine what is authentic and what not. Some of the letters may have been forgeries or literary exercises assembled in collections which were already circulated in the 2nd century AD. It has been asserted that Philostratus himself forged a considerable part of the letters he inserted into his work; others were older forgeries available to him.\n\nComparisons with Jesus\nIn Philostratus's description of Apollonius's life and deeds, there are a number of similarities with the life and especially the claimed miracles of Jesus. In the late 3rd century Porphyry, an anti-Christian Neoplatonic philosopher, claimed in his treatise Against the Christians that the miracles of Jesus were not unique, and mentioned Apollonius as a non-Christian who had accomplished similar achievements. During the Diocletianic Persecution, some writers cited Apollonius as an example in their polemics.  Hierocles, one of the campaigners for a stronger policy against Christians, wrote a pamphlet where he argued that Apollonius exceeded Christ as a wonder-worker and yet wasn't worshipped as a god and that the cultured biographers of Apollonius were more trustworthy than the uneducated apostles. This attempt to make Apollonius a hero of the anti-Christian movement provoked sharp replies from bishop Eusebius of Caesarea and from Lactantius. Eusebius wrote an extant reply to the pamphlet of Hierocles (Contra Hieroclem), where he claimed that Philostratus was a fabulist and that Apollonius was a sorcerer in league with demons.\n\nComparisons between Apollonius and Jesus became commonplace in the 17th and 18th\u00a0centuries in the context of polemic about Christianity. Several advocates of Enlightenment, deism and anti-Church positions saw him as an early forerunner of their own ethical and religious ideas, a proponent of a universal, non-denominational religion compatible with reason. These comparisons continued into the 20th century.\n\n In 1680, Charles Blount, a radical English deist, published the first English translation of the first two books of Philostratus's Life with an anti-Church introduction.\n In the Marquis de Sade's Dialogue Between a Priest and a Dying Man, the Dying Man compares Jesus to Apollonius as a false prophet.\n In his 1909 book The Christ, John Remsburg postulated that the religion of Apollonius disappeared because the proper conditions for its development did not exist. Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam thrived, however, because the existing conditions were favorable.\n Some early- to mid-20th-century Theosophists, notably C. W. Leadbeater, Alice A. Bailey and Benjamin Creme, have maintained that Apollonius of Tyana was the reincarnation of the being they call the Master Jesus. Helena Blavatsky in 1881 refers to Appolonius of Tyana as \"the great thaumaturgist of the second century AD\".\n In the mid 20th century, the American expatriate poet Ezra Pound evoked Apollonius in his later Cantos as a figure associated with sun-worship and as a messianic rival to Christ. Pound identified him  as Aryan within an anti-semitic mythology, and celebrated his Sun worship and aversion to ancient Jewish animal sacrifice.\n In Gerald Messadi\u00e9's The Man Who Became God, Apollonius appeared as a wandering philosopher and magician of about the same age as Jesus.\n Edward Gibbon compared Apollonius to Jesus in the footnotes to The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, saying \"Apollonius of Tyana was born about the same time as Jesus Christ. His life (that of the former) is related in so fabulous a manner by his disciples, that we are at a loss to discover whether he was a sage, an imposter, or a fanatic.\" This led to controversy, as critics believed Gibbon was alluding to Jesus being a fanatic.\n Biblical scholar Bart D. Ehrman relates that he begins his introductory class on the New Testament, by describing an important figure from the first century without first revealing he is talking about the stories attached to Apollonius of Tyana:\n\nProponents of the Christ myth theory sometimes cite Apollonius as an example of the mythic hero archetype that they allege applies to Jesus as well. However, Erkki Koskenniemi has stated that Apollonius of Tyana is not a representative of a Hellenistic divine man and that there is no evidence that Christians constructed their paradigm of Jesus based on traditions associated with him. Moreover, the Christ myth theory is considered a fringe theory in scholarship and is generally not taken seriously.\n\nImpact\n\nAntiquity \nIn the 2nd\u00a0century the satirist Lucian of Samosata was a sharp critic of Neo-Pythagoreanism. After 180\u00a0AD he wrote a pamphlet wherein he attacked Alexander of Abonoteichus, a student of one of Apollonius's students, as a charlatan and suggested that the whole school was based on fraud. From this we can infer that Apollonius really had students and that his school survived at least until Lucian's time. One of Philostratus's foremost aims was to oppose this view. Although he related various miraculous feats of Apollonius, he emphasized at the same time that his hero was not a magician but a serious philosopher and a champion of traditional Greek values.\n\nWhen Emperor Aurelian conducted his military campaign against the Palmyrene Empire, he captured Tyana in 272\u00a0AD. According to the Historia Augusta he abstained from destroying the city after having a vision of Apollonius admonishing him to spare the innocent citizens.\n\nIn Late Antiquity talismans made by Apollonius appeared in several cities of the Eastern Roman Empire, as if they were sent from heaven. They were magical figures and columns erected in public places, meant to protect the cities from afflictions. The great popularity of these talismans was a challenge to the Christians. Some Byzantine authors condemned them as sorcery and the work of demons, others admitted that such magic was beneficial; none of them claimed that it didn't work.\n\nIn the Western Roman Empire, Sidonius Apollinaris was a Christian admirer of Apollonius in the 5th\u00a0century. He produced a Latin translation of Philostratus's Life, which is lost.\n\nModern era \n\nBeginning in the early 16th century, there was great interest in Apollonius in Europe, but the traditional ecclesiastical viewpoint prevailed, and until the Age of Enlightenment the Tyanean was usually treated as a demonic magician and a great enemy of the Church who collaborated with the devil and tried to overthrow Christianity.\n\nEliphas Levi claims to have raised the shade of Apollonius of Tyana in an occult ritual in London as described in his textbook on Magic, Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie, 1854\u20131856.\n\nApollonius of Tyana in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Scripture \nThe Tablet of Wisdom, written by Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, the founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, names \"Balinus\" (Apollonius) as a great philosopher, who \"surpassed everyone else in the diffusion of arts and sciences and soared unto the loftiest heights of humility and supplication.\" In another text Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h states that he \"derived his knowledge and sciences from the Hermetic Tablets and most of the philosophers who followed him made their philosophical and scientific discoveries from his words and statements\".\n\nApollonius of Tyana in contemporary literature and film \nEdward Bulwer-Lytton refers to Apollonius in The Last Days of Pompeii and Zanoni as a great master of occult power and wisdom.\n\nApollonius of Tyana is a major character in Steven Saylor's historical novel Empire, which depicts his confrontation with the harsh Emperor Domitian. Apollonius is shown confounding the Emperor (and many others) in quick-witted dialogue, reminiscent of Socrates. The book's plot leaves ambiguous the issue of whether Apollonius possessed true magical power or that he was able to use suggestion and other clever tricks.\n\nAvram Davidson's science fiction novel Masters of the Maze has Apollonius of Tyana as one of a select group of humans (and other sentient beings) who had penetrated to the center of a mysterious \"Maze\" traversing all of space and time. There he dwells in eternal repose, in company with the Biblical Enoch, the Chinese King Wen and Lao Tze, the 19th-century Briton Bathurst, and various other sages of the past and future, some of them Martians.\n\nIn The Circus of Dr. Lao (1935) by Charles G. Finney, Apollonius appears in the employ of Dr. Lao's circus and brings a dead man back to life.\n\nApollonius of Tyana is one of the 7 circus characters portrayed by Tony Randall in the 1964 film The Seven Faces of Dr. Lao. This character does not have any philosophical context, rather he is a sideshow attraction similar to a fortune-teller who has been blessed with clairvoyance. While he always speaks the truth about the future, he is accursed with an ironic fate - nobody ever believes what he says.\n\nIn television, Apollonius of Tyana was portrayed by Mel Ferrer in The Fantastic Journey episode entitled \u201cFunhouse\u201d. Apollonius was banished centuries ago to a time zone by the gods for opposing them. When the time zone travelers led by the 23rd century healer and pacifist named Varian arrive at a seemingly abandoned carnival, Apollonius intends to lure them into his funhouse of horrors so that he can possess the body of one of the travelers and escape his eternal imprisonment.\n\nKeats' poem Lamia mentions and discusses Apollonius.\n\nEditions \n Philostratus: Apollonius of Tyana.

The show follows Ron and Amy Shirley, Bobby Brantley, and their team of repossession agents in Lizard Lick, North Carolina, the an unincorporated area near the Raleigh suburb of Wendell.\n\nHistory\nLizard Lick Towing and Recovery is a local towing and recovery company owned and operated by Lizard Lick resident Ronnie Shirley and his wife Amy Shirley.\n\nRon Shirley started Lizard Lick Towing in 1998 with a single truck, along with his wife Amy Shirley. In 10 years, the company grew to 15 staff members and a fleet of 20 trucks. Bobby Brantley is Ron's friend and longtime co-worker, who started out as a dissatisfied customer after Ron towed his truck, then began working at Lizard Lick to pay off his debt.\n\nRon and Amy originally were going to be part of Wife Swap.\n\nAccording to the local Eastern Wake News, the television series got its start at the end of August 2008, when the station sent a cameraman down for one day of shooting and that was all it took for a contract to be written. Those at the network were merely scouting out prospects at the time, but after realizing Amy Shirley was not only a powerlifter, but a mortician and co-owner of the recovery business, they realized there was more color to the picture than originally anticipated.

It has a presence in India, the United States, and about 30 other countries in Africa, South East Asia, West Asia, and CIS. It was established in 1973.\n\nMarkets and business\nAjanta Pharma has over 1,400 products registered currently in various countries and an equal number of products are under approval.  In India, the company is a branded generic company focused on a few high growth specialty therapies in ophthalmology, dermatology, cardiology, and pain management.\n\nAjanta Pharma exports products to over 30 countries in Asia and Africa. In these markets, the company serves a wide range of therapeutic products in the areas of antimalarial, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, antibiotic, dermatology, antihistamine, multivitamin, gynecology, and pain management.\n\nAjanta Pharma has recently stepped up its presence in the United States with a select product portfolio, which includes niche and complex technology products. Currently, the company has 27 products in the US market.\n\nHistory \nIn the early 2000s, Ajanta was noted as a major source of foreign currency, alongside Reddy Labs, arising from sales in Southeast Asia.  In particular, in 2003, a joint-venture between Ajanta and the Ministry of Health in Turkministan accounted for fully half of the pharmaceutical needs of the country.  The company had made several other joint-ventures with regional governments, such as Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrygyzstan and Tajikistan, which it severed in the 2010s due to their being unprofitable.\n\nThe company experienced an enormous loss in 2005 in terms of diminution of the value of investments, amounting to four times the year's profits.  That same year, the company was noted as having the highest sales in India for any Indian pharmaceutical company, with sales of \u20b913.56 billion.\n\nIn 2015, the company was highlighted as having had exceptional stock appreciation over the preceding four years, and the listing of the stock on the BSE 500 was noted.  By 2019, the stock was listed on the S&P BSE 200 index.\n\nManufacturing facilities\nAjanta Pharma operates seven manufacturing facilities in India. Six facilities manufacture finished formulations, including Dahej and Paithan plants which is approved by the US FDA and Guwahati plant which caters to domestic and emerging markets. Another plant manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) primarily for captive consumption.\n\nLegal proceedings \nBayer filed suit before the Delhi High Court accusing Ajanta of patent infringement on the erectile dysfunction treatments vardenafil and vardenafil hydrochloride.  Ajanta argued that Bayer was not using its patent in India for the benefit of India, which led the court to provide partial relief to an injunction granted to Bayer, allowing Ajanta to manufacture but not sell the product, in January 2017.  Bayer and Ajanta reached an unspecified agreement after mediation was ordered by the court in February 2017.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nPatent applications in India \n\n 1998\u2014Gazette of India, 31 October 1998, p. 1087 ;Gazette of India, 26 February 2000, p. 116\n1999\u2014Gazette of India, 18 September 1999, p. 843 ; Gazette of India, 4 March 2000, p. 123; Gazette of India, 20 October 2001, p. 1886\n 2000\u2014Gazette of India, 24 June 2000, p. 477; Gazette of India, 30 June 2001, p. 867; Gazette of India, 14 October 2001, p. 975; Gazette of India, 8 June 2002, p. 1178; Gazette of India, 6 September 2003, p. 4006\n2001\u2014Gazette of India, 29 March 2003, p. 1200\n2002\u2014Gazette of India, 15 February 2003, p. 518; Gazette of India, 20 March 2004, p. 1748; Gazette of India, 29 May 2004, p. 4014\n\nProducts subject to price control in India \n\n Clinidipine+Metroprolol tablets\u2014Gazette of India, Extraordinary, 21 December 2018, p. 8\nTimolol+Brinzolamide eye drops\u2014Gazette of India, Extraordinary, 2 November 2018, p. 21\n\nExternal links\nAjanta Pharma, \"One of the Giants of Tomorrow\" - Fortune India\u2019\nAjanta Pharma Ltd Listed in 'Forbes India - Super 50 Companies'\nAjanta Pharma Ltd |Company Profile\n\nPharmaceutical companies of India\nManufacturing companies based in Mumbai\nIndian companies established in 1973\n1973 establishments in Maharashtra\nPharmaceutical companies established in 1973\nCompanies listed on the National Stock Exchange of India\nCompanies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange", "Ramboldo XIII, Count of Collalto (also Rambaldo; 1575 \u2013 19 November 1630) was an Italian Imperial  commander.\n\nBiography\nBorn at Mantua into an ancient noble Venetian family, dating back to the 10th century, he was the son of Venetian general Antonio IV of Collalto.

While farming the surrounding property Jackson kept a wide-ranging diary that remains a valuable primary source on early Minnesota settlement.  The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 for its local significance in the themes of agriculture and exploration/settlement.  It was nominated for its association with Jackson, whose \"acute perceptions and wide range of observations place him above the ordinary farm diarist\", in the words of Rodney C.

Franklin was admitted as a graduate student in history and government. Auburn's desegregation was exemplary of both cooperation with the media and Ralph Brown Draughon's leadership.\n\nBackground\nIn November 1962, Harold Franklin, a thirty-year-old graduate of Alabama State College, applied for admission to Auburn as a graduate student in history and government. The university rejected Franklin's application in January 1963, originally citing a lack of a graduate program in government as the reason. His application was again rejected in February, Auburn citing Alabama State College's lack of accreditation, an issue stemming from the school's lack of state funding. On August 23 of that year, Franklin, with attorney Fred Gray, filed a class action suit in the US District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. The court of Frank M Johnson ruled in Franklin's favor on November 5, 1963. The Board of Trustees voted on November 23 to follow Johnson's ruling, and Franklin's enrollment and registration was set for the spring semester of 1964, beginning January 4.\n\nMedia Relations\nWith the violent events of the Birmingham protests and the murder of Medgar Evers as a backdrop to the situation at Auburn, university president, Ralph Brown Draughon wanted to avoid a violent spectacle on his campus at all costs. Hoping to emulate the desegregation of Clemson University in January, 1963, Draughon invited Clemson's Director of Public Relations, Joe Sherman, to visit Auburn in June, 1963. Sherman advised Draughon to create a good rapport with the media, as well as to appeal to the community for moderation. Auburn Director of Public Relations, Ed Crawford, took care of the relationship with the media by setting up the \u201cNews Central.\u201d Here, Auburn housed all authorized media personnel, supplying them with every imaginable amenity from typewriters to dark rooms for their film to food and drink.\n\nCampus Security\nDraughon was able to handle the securing of campus with a multifaceted approach. First, Draughon shut down Auburn's campus to everyone except authorized faculty, staff, students and police. Appointing Col. Lynwood Funchess, Director of Building and Grounds, as head of security, Draughon deputized members of the athletic department to patrol campus as well as line Franklin's paths to class for his first couple days.\n\nMeetings with Student Leaders\nThe other face of Draughon's security plan included a series of meetings he had been holding since the failed desegregation of the University of Alabama in 1956. Draughon had routinely hosted student leaders to bring them in line with his plan for a quiet, uneventful desegregation of Auburn University. These meetings produced a list of rules that would go into effect when the time for desegregation came, and were to be disseminated by these student leaders. Some of the more notable rules were a ban on firearms on campus for the spring semester, and a ban on congregating in large groups on campus. These rules were announced December 3 and required students to sign a pledge agreeing to abide by them in order to return to campus after break.\n\nResistance from Gov. Wallace\nIn hopes of further augmenting the security on campus during Franklin's first few days, Draughon requested access to city, state, and federal officials for assistance. Agreeing to provide state troopers to reinforce campus and local police, Governor George Wallace refused to provide federal agents as well as specifically refusing access to bodyguards for Franklin, even in the event of a riot. On December 1, Wallace also pressured Draughon to release an announcement stating that Magnolia Hall, the only men's dormitory on campus, would no longer be housing graduate students. This announcement was shot down by the court on January 3, ruling that Auburn must house Franklin just like any other student.\n\nJanuary 4, 1964\nOn a cold, rainy Saturday, Auburn University's campus was invaded by one hundred state troopers sent by Gov. Wallace under the command of Col. Albert J Lingo. Seen as the wildcard in Draughon's plans, Lingo proved true to speculation when he changed to the meeting location last minute. Seeing Lingo's troopers changing position, FBI agents sent to oversee events notified US attorney John Doar, on campus to supervise the university's desegregation just as had at every other university to that point.\nDoar was then able to notify Franklin and his attorney, Fred Gray, of the change in plans, and advised them to head directly to Reverend Powers McLeod's office at the Auburn Methodist Church. Here, Doar had Franklin's bag searched by two FBI agents who could later testify on Franklin's behalf in the case a gun was slipped into it by Lingo's men, similar to what had happened with James Meredith at Ole Miss. At McLeod's office Franklin was intercepted by Joseph Sarver, Auburn director of development, who was to transport Franklin while on campus due to Lingo's orders to arrest any federal agent or unauthorized personnel trying to enter campus.\n\nAround one o\u2019clock, Franklin, escorted by Sarver, arrived at Magnolia Hall, where three floors of one wing had been cleared to house Franklin. When it was time to leave to register for classes Franklin, escorted by two university officials, left Magnolia Hall for the library. Outside they met Col. Lingo, who, under the pretense of Judge Johnson's ruling that Auburn should treat Franklin like any other student, refused to allow the university officials to continue with Franklin. Franklin was swarmed by reporters on his walk and stopped by a trooper requesting to see his student ID, which he had not yet received, however aside from this, his walk peaceful and without confrontation.\n \nUpon entering the library, Franklin was again met by a swarm of reporters before being welcomed by Dr. William Parker, dean of the graduate school. Franklin was then seated at Malcolm McMillan's table for enrollment advising. Franklin emerged roughly an hour later, now an enrolled and registered student at Auburn University.\n\nReferences\n\nHistory of Auburn University", "Ace Theatre in Miami, Florida, is an Art Deco commercial structure constructed in 1930 in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood.

It encompasses the Ross Embayment, the Ross Sea, the area under  the Ross Ice Shelf and a part of Marie Byrd Land in West Antarctica, reaching to the base of the Antarctic Peninsula. It has an estimated length of  and a width of approximately . Its evolution is due to lithospheric thinning of an area of Antarctica that resulted in the demarcation of East and West Antarctica. The scale and evolution of the rift system has been compared to that of the Basin and Range Province of the Western United States.\n\nGeology \n\nExploration of the geology of the West Antarctic Rift System is limited because apart from peaks of the Transantarctic Mountains that protrude above the ice, much of the region is covered by the Ross Ice Shelf and the vast West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Several mountain ranges are located at the eastern boundary in Marie Byrd Land. Consequently, the rift is less well known than other major rift valley systems. It is known that like the East African Rift, the West Antarctic Rift System comprises a number of much shorter rifts that cross Antarctica. Beneath the floor of the Ross Sea four rift basins have been detected by marine seismic reflections surveys. Rift basins have been mapped under the West Antarctic Ice Sheet including the Bentley Subglacial Trench.\n\nEvolution \nRifting began in the Late Cretaceous as a result of tectonic extension (stretching and thinning of the crust and mantle) in approximately an east\u2013west orientation, by plate tectonics processes. The extension within the Ross Embayment occurred over four time periods and totals 500 kilometers or more, mostly before the late Miocene. The first phase happened in the east near Marie Byrd Land before the Campbell Plateau of Zealandia broke away from Antarctica in the Late Cretaceous.\n\nA second phase during the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene extended the central areas of the embayment. This extension was at least 130 kilometers. \n\nA third phase is related to 170\u2013180 kilometers of Eocene and Oligocene seafloor spreading in the western parts of the embayment on the Adare Trough or basin in the deep-sea. This episode of sea floor spreading created the ocean crust that now underlies much of the Northern Basin. This phase also resulted in extension of the Victoria Land Basin (95 km). \n\nA small amount of extension (~7 kilometers) occurred in the Adare basin and Victoria Land Basin (10-15 kilometers) in a fourth phase during Miocene time. Displacement including minor extension in the western WARS and Ross Embayment computed from reconstruction of oceanic magnetic anomalies ended 11\u00a0million years ago. \n\nDuring the Eocene to Miocene clockwise relative rotation of West Antarctica with respect to East Antarctica resulted in extension in the western Ross Embayment but contraction, in Marie Byrd Land of West Antarctica. Subsidence to form the present topography of the embayment continued through the Cenozoic as the extended crust and mantle under the Ross Embayment cooled. Faulting within the Terror Rift, located in the Victoria Land Basin, continued after 11 Ma, and probably into or through Quaternary time. \u00a0\n\nAlthough most rifts within the West Antarctic Rift System are no longer active, geodetic surveys show that West Antarctica is moving away from  East Antarctica in a north/northeasterly direction (approximately in the direction of the South Georgia Islands) at a rate of not greater than 1- or .\n\nThe West Antarctic Rift System is the source of all the recently active volcanoes within Antarctica and all the recently active volcanoes on the continent. It is responsible for most of the major mountain systems outside the Antarctic Peninsula. Volcanism has been attributed to the rifting and also a mantle hotspot.\n\nGlaciology \nThe WARS is also believed to have a major influence on ice flows in West Antarctica. In western Marie Byrd Land active glaciers flow through fault-bounded valleys (grabens) of the WARS. Sub-ice volcanism has been detected and proposed to influence ice flow. Fast-moving ice streams in the Siple Coast adjacent to the east edge of the Ross Ice Shelf are influenced by the lubrication provided by water-saturated till within fault-bounded grabens within the rift, which could cause rapid breakup of the ice sheet if global warming accelerates.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nROSETTA Project\nGeology of Antarctica\nMesozoic Antarctica\nMesozoic rifts and grabens\nCenozoic rifts and grabens\nTransantarctic Mountains\nWest Antarctica", "Cavalera Conspiracy is an American heavy metal supergroup founded by Brazilian brothers Max (vocals, rhythm guitar) and Igor Cavalera (drums, percussion). The band originally formed in 2007 as Inflikted but changed its name for legal reasons. The group's creation marked the end of a 10-year feud between the Cavalera brothers who founded Sepultura in the early 1980s.\n\nFollowing the brothers' falling out, Max Cavalera had formed a new band, Soulfly, and Igor had recorded four studio albums with Sepultura before leaving the band in January 2006. In July 2006, Max received an unexpected call from his brother, and by the end of the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix, Arizona, to perform in a Soulfly show. Igor joined Soulfly in concert and performed two Sepultura songs. After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project, and Igor accepted. To complete the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and Joe Duplantier (Gojira) as bass guitarist. The group then recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co-producer Logan Mader in July 2007. Named after the band's original moniker, Inflikted was released through Roadrunner Records on March 25, 2008. Cavalera Conspiracy has released three more albums since then: Blunt Force Trauma (2011), Pandemonium (2014) and Psychosis (2017).\n\nHistory\n\nBackground \n\nOn August 16, 1996, at 1:43\u00a0a.m., Max Cavalera's stepson Dana Wells, was killed in a car accident at the age of 21 in Phoenix, Arizona. At the time, Cavalera was the lead vocalist for Sepultura which was on tour promoting its sixth studio album, Roots, in England with Ozzy Osbourne. After hearing the news, Ozzy and his wife Sharon Osbourne hired a private plane to take Cavalera and his wife, manager and mother of Dana, Gloria, back home. After the funeral, Max returned his focus to Sepultura, and the band resumed its European tour. Then, following a sold-out show at London's Brixton Academy on December 16\u2014later documented on the live album Under a Pale Grey Sky\u2014drummer Igor Cavalera, guitarist Andreas Kisser, and bassist Paulo Jr. told Max they wanted to replace numerous members of the band's staff, including Gloria. Andreas, Paulo and Igor proposed ending the contract with Gloria and hiring a new manager for Sepultura, saying that she paid more attention to Max than the band. The trio suggested that she could continue as Max's personal manager but that someone else should manage the band. Coincidentally, Gloria's contract was up for renewal, so she let the band end it. Max felt betrayed by his mates, especially his brother.\n\nMax and Gloria decided to leave Sepultura after it turned out the band tried to speed up the funeral of Dana, to continue touring faster. In an interview with Revolver magazine's May 2008 issue, Max explained that Gloria had worked for Sepultura for two years without earning one dollar, just for the passion of the music. Disagreeing with the other Sepultura members, Max said, \"If this is how it's going down, I'm out. I quit. I can't just put a mask on and backstab a bunch of people that trust me.\" Later, Max stated that it was the hardest decision he had to make in his life.\n\nHis departure from Sepultura caused a 10-year feud between the Cavalera brothers. During this period, Max formed a new band, Soulfly, which has released nine studio albums. Igor continued as Sepultura's drummer, appearing on the group's next four studio records before leaving in January 2006 to work on his DJ project, Mixhell, and to spend more time with his family.\n\nIn July 2006, while Soulfly was on tour, Max received a call from his brother, and by the end of the conversation, Max had invited Igor to visit him in Phoenix for the tenth anniversary of D-Low, an annual memorial show for Dana. At the concert, Igor joined Soulfly and performed two Sepultura songs, \"Roots Bloody Roots\" and \"Attitude,\" for which Dana had written the lyrics. In an interview with Chad Bowar for About.com, Max stated that performance was \"the birth of Cavalera Conspiracy\". After the show, Max suggested they begin a new project after Soulfly finished touring. Max confessed to Bowar that he had lied to Igor when he said all the songs were ready when he had only finished one. He added, \"It was one of those good lies. Everything rolled from there. What I like about the Conspiracy is that nothing is really planned. One thing leads to another. There's no pressure and it feels like a different project than anything I've done.\"\n\nName \nBefore talking with his brother, Max wrote a song entitled \"Inflikted,\" inspired by Sepultura's visit in 1992 to Indonesia where they saw a \"crazy ritual\". Describing what he saw, Max said, \"There was self-inflicted pain, knives, blood, fire. It was insane. It stuck in my head.\" Max stated that \"Inflikted\" was supposed to go towards Soulfly's sixth studio album Conquer, but he wanted to do the song with Igor. For legal reasons, they could not use Inflikted as the band name. According to Max, \"A lot of people had used it before, so he had to come up with something else.\" When trying to find a name, he \"blurted out\" Cavalera Conspiracy, and Igor liked it. Max added, \"I think I like it better than Inflikted. It has a ring to it that connects me and Igor as two brothers back together.\"\n\nInflikted (2007\u20132009) \n\nTo complete the band, Max chose Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and vocalist Joe Duplantier of Gojira. Rizzo was his choice because, according to Max, he and Rizzo \"play together in Soulfly and musically, we are like twin brothers\". Max also said that he talked to Rizzo about going back to the roots of the mid-1980s thrash metal, which he did with Sepultura. Max continues, \"Marc was completely into it and he did great. He surpassed what I asked him to do.\" Max stated that Duplantier was Gloria's idea, as he did not know him at all. He added, \"We had no idea who the guy is, he's from a different continent and we don't speak French. I did know the Gojira CD. But I like the element of surprise and danger Joe brought.\"\n\nIn July 2007, the band recorded their debut album at Undercity Studios in Los Angeles with engineer and co-producer Logan Mader (who played in Soulfly for a year after leaving Machine Head in 1999) and Lucas Banker of the Dirty Icon production team. The album included guest appearances of bassist Rex Brown on the song \"Ultra-Violent\", and Max's stepson Ritchie Cavalera singing on \"Black Ark\". The band made their debut live performance on August 31, 2007, at the 11th Annual D-Low Memorial Concert in Tempe, AZ. Inflikted, named after the band's original moniker, was released through Roadrunner Records on March 25, 2008. Commercially, Inflikted did not have great sales, reaching moderate positions on the charts. The album reached the top 30 on Austria, Finland and Germany, and the top 40 on Australia and Belgium. Having sold more than 9,000 copies during its first week, Inflikted peaked at number\u00a072 on the Billboard 200 chart.\n\nThe Infliktour supporting the debut album began on May 30, 2008, when Cavalera Conspiracy played its first official concert at the Electric Weekend festival in Madrid, Spain. However, for this live performance and the subsequent European tour, the band had to replace Duplantier, who was unable to join Cavalera Conspiracy on the road as he was recording Gojira's fourth studio album, The Way of All Flesh. He was replaced by Johny Chow of Fireball Ministry. Between June and mid-July 2008, the band performed in several festivals, including appearances at the Pinkpop Festival, Rock am Ring and Rock im Park, Download Festival, Graspop Metal Meeting, Eurock\u00e9ennes, among others.\n\nThe band then returned to the United States for a North American tour from mid-July to August 2008, featuring headling dates with The Dillinger Escape Plan, Throwdown, Bury Your Dead, and Incite. Cavalera Conspiracy also performed at the Monsters of Rock festival, which was held on July 26 at McMahon Stadium in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and the one-day Ozzfest at the Pizza Hut Park on August 9. During its tour, Cavalera Conspiracy performed on several dates with Judas Priest at the Priest Feast throughout Eastern Europe, but both bands cancelled their shows in Australia and New Zealand, which were scheduled for September 2008. In a press release, promoters claimed the cancellation was due to \"logistic and freight issues\", but Max Cavalera wrote on the band's website that they were \"banned\" from performing in New Zealand and Australia because someone\u2014whom he did not specify\u2014\"deemed\" them an \"inappropriate\" band and \"too inflammatory\".\n\nDue to commitments of Max with Soulfly and Igor with Mixhell, Cavalera Conspiracy was put on hold until August 2009, when the band regrouped to touring in Europe and Japan, including shows at the Ankkarock, Summer Sonic, Pukkelpop, and Trutnov festivals, and two September 2009 dates in Austria and Russia.\n\nBlunt Force Trauma (2009\u20132012) \n\nIn October 2009, Max told Noisecreep that he and his brother Igor have plans to work on a second Cavalera Conspiracy album together. The following month, Noisecreep spoke with Igor about a new Cavalera Conspiracy album. Igor said that he and Max are both busy with their main commitments, but \"We have some ideas of maybe doing a remix album of [Inflikted] and have people like Justice or Soulwax\u2014even some dub artists that my brother likes\u2014remix the whole album,\" he says. \"But that's just an idea. It's nothing confirmed. But me and Max are talking about doing a new album in the future, but there's no pressure. There's nobody from the label or the agents trying to push us to do it as quick as possible.\"\n\nCavalera Conspiracy entered the studio in April 2010 to begin recording the follow-up to their 2008 debut album, Inflikted. In May 2010, the band finished recording with producer Logan Mader in co-production with Max. Cavalera Conspiracy recruited their touring bassist Johny Chow to play bass on the album, as former member Joe Duplantier was busy with Gojira's next album. Upon finished recordings, Roadrunner Records confirmed that the band's new album would not be released until early 2011.\n\nOn November 16, 2010, in an article on blabbermouth.net it was revealed that the band's second album would be titled Blunt Force Trauma, and would be released on March 29, 2011. A track list for the album was also revealed.\n\nPrior to the album's release, two songs were published by the band. The song \"Killing inside\" was released via the homepage of the band's label Roadrunner Records and the Cavalera Conspiracy newsletter. The download was only available from February 7, 2011, until February 9, 2011. The title track \"Blunt Force Trauma\" was released on February 17, 2011, as a stream via the Roadrunner Records homepage.\n\nIn a November 2012 concert in Belo Horizonte, original Sepultura lead guitarist Jairo Guedz joined the band (performing with Tony Campos on bass) to perform Troops of Doom.\n\nPandemonium (2013\u20132016) \n\nIn September 2013 Max Cavalera stated his intent to begin work on a new Cavalera Conspiracy album in 2014, which will be predominantly grindcore. Igor then implied on October 1 that the album could consist solely of the two brothers, without involvement from Marc Rizzo or Johny Chow, with the album produced by James Murphy. However this was proven false when Max's wife Gloria announced the trio of Max, Igor and Marc entering the studio with producer John Gray in late December 2013, along with the announcement on December 31 of Nate Newton of Converge as the band's new bassist.\n\nIn August 2014, a new song titled \"Banzai Kamikaze\" was uploaded to Napalm's SoundCloud account. The new Cavalera Conspiracy album Pandemonium was released on October 31, 2014, in Europe and on November 4, 2014, in North America. 2015 saw Johny Chow return to Cavalera Conspiracy on bass for live shows, however the group's Facebook page lists Chow, Newton and Campos as rotating live duties on bass.\n\nPsychosis (2017\u2013present) \n\nIn May 2017, it was announced that Cavalera Conspiracy had entered The Platinum Underground Studios in Phoenix, Arizona with producer Arthur Rizk (Code Orange, Power Trip, Inquisition) to record their fourth studio album and follow-up to 2014's Pandemonium. They had revealed the album title as Psychosis, and a release date of November 17, 2017. The band also announced that a studio documentary titled The Conspiracy Diaries was being produced simultaneously by Horns Up Rocks! On December 1, ahead of the band's European Headbangers Ball Tour under the \"Max and Iggor Return to Roots\" banner, Marc Rizzo dropped out, citing a \"dire family emergency\" and was replaced by Soulfly bassist Mike Leon. Cavalera Conspiracy were rumored to be touring with Sepultura in early 2018, which would have been the first time in over 20 years that the Cavalera brothers shared the stage with their former band; however, this proved to be false.\n\nStyle, lyrics and reception \nRevolver's Jon Wiederhorn, pointed out that although the songs were arranged and recorded quickly, Inflikted sounds neither hastily executed nor incomplete. There's a connection between Max's riffing and Igor's drumming; a chemistry that comes only from musicians who learned to play together and honed their craft through years of studio sessions and live shows. Wiederhorn described Inflikted as an \"explosive flashback to the remorseless thrash and primal groove-metal Sepultura created between 1991's Arise and 1993's Chaos A.D. [...] The songs are raw and simple, yet graced with syncopated drum runs, experimental guitar flourishes, and sonic frills inspired by Max's love of reggae and Igor's fascination with DJ culture. The vocals are primal and savage, emboldened by a sense of urgency that's equal parts desperation, rage, and celebration.\"\n\nOn Inflikted, Max was the group's songwriter and lyricist. At the time of the album recording, he was watching the same four movies almost every day: Apocalypse Now, City of God, A Clockwork Orange, and La Haine. Max revealed to Revolver that he wanted to do something different, and it gave him a lot of ideas. He said, \"What came out of this album was more than enough to fill the void of not working together for so long. It's pretty intense. From the first moment, it's war.\"\n\nAllmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia, said that release of Inflikted \"brings to fruition one of the most anticipated yet most improbable reunions in heavy metal history.\" Rivadavia expressed that Duplantier \"generally just keeps a low sonic profile and his nose out of trouble, but Rizzo's contributions really can't be overstated. [...] His otherworldly soloing and inventive melodic lines often serve as the creative catalysts responsible for the most inspired moments.\" Keith Carman of Exclaim! praised the group's musicianship on Inflikted, saying that \"it wouldn't be a stretch to proclaim that Inflikted, with its detuned grunt, bombastic lyrics and hyperactive drumming, is the album that should have succeeded Sepultura's widely-acclaimed 1996 powerhouse Roots.\" Like the former, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote enthusiastically for both Cavalera Conspiracy and Inflikted.\n\nSure, it's not a Sepultura reunion, but having Max and Igor performing on record for the first time in a dozen years is as close as we'll ever get, and not only does Cavalera Conspiracy's Inflikted revisit the post-thrash sounds of 1993's Chaos A.D., but it manages to outshine anything Sepultura has put out in the last dozen years. Rounded out by Soulfly lead guitarist Marc Rizzo and, most impressively, Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier on bass and rhythm guitar, the band is as solid a metal supergroup as you'll ever come across, and the album's eleven tracks benefit hugely from the chemistry between the four musicians.\n\nJoel McIver of Record Collector wrote: \"Inflikted is gobsmackingly violent. The 11 tracks combine hardcore punk (without the crappy production) and thrash metal (without the clich\u00e9s) to produce an insanely fast record loaded with references to their best work: Sepultura's Beneath the Remains and Arise. It's too modern to sound close to those records, of course, but in terms of attitude and riff weight it matches them beat-for-beat and riff-for-riff. Those thousands praying for the Max-era Sepultura line-up to reform can get off their knees: the key reunion has happened.\" Cavalera Conspiracy has been labeled as thrash metal and death metal.\n\nBand members \n\nCurrent members\nMax Cavalera \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar \nIgor Cavalera \u2013 drums, percussion \n\nTouring members\nMike Leon \u2013 bass , lead guitar \nDaniel Gonzalez \u2013 lead guitar \n\nSession members\nArthur Rizk \u2013 bass, noise, synthesizer \n\nFormer members\nJoe Duplantier \u2013 bass, rhythm guitar, additional co-lead vocals \nJohny Chow \u2013 bass \nNate Newton \u2013 bass, additional co-lead vocals \nMarc Rizzo \u2013 lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals \n\nFormer touring members\nTony Campos \u2013 bass \nDino Cazares \u2013 lead guitar\n\nTimeline\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nMusic videos\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nAmerican death metal musical groups\nAmerican groove metal musical groups\n2007 establishments in Arizona\nAmerican thrash metal musical groups\nRoadrunner Records artists\nNapalm Records artists\nMusical groups established in 2007\nMusical groups from Phoenix, Arizona\nHeavy metal musical groups from Arizona\nHeavy metal supergroups\nMusical quartets", "Marsing is a city in Owyhee County, Idaho.

She was a founding member of the German Green Party, the first Green party to rise to prominence both nationally in Germany and worldwide. In 1982, she was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for \"forging and implementing a new vision uniting ecological concerns with disarmament, social justice and human rights.\"\n\nEarly life and education \n\nPetra Karin Lehmann was born in G\u00fcnzburg, Bavaria (then the American Zone of Occupation, Germany), in 1947. She changed her name to Kelly after her mother married John E. Kelly, a US Army officer. She was educated in a Roman Catholic convent in G\u00fcnzburg and later attended school in Georgia and Virginia after her family relocated to the United States in 1959. She lived and studied in the United States until her return to West Germany in 1970. She retained her West German citizenship throughout her life.\n\nKelly admired Martin Luther King Jr., and campaigned for Robert F. Kennedy and Hubert Humphrey in the 1968 U.S. elections. She studied political science at the School of International Service at American University (Washington, D.C.), from which she graduated in 1970 with a bachelor's degree. She also graduated from the European Institute at the University of Amsterdam in 1971 with a master's degree.\n\nCareer \n\nWhile working at the European Commission (Brussels, Belgium, 1971\u201383), Kelly participated in numerous peace and environmental campaigns in Germany and other countries.\n\nAfter working for two years at the European Commission, she moved to an administrative post at the Economic and Social Committee, where she championed women's rights.\n\nGerman Green Party \n\nKelly was one of the founders of Die Gr\u00fcnen, the German Green Party in 1979. In 1983 she was elected to the Bundestag via the Electoral list as a Member of the Bundestag representing Bavaria. She was subsequently re-elected in 1987 with a higher share of the vote.\n\nIn 1981, Kelly was involved in a protest of 400,000 people in Bonn against nuclear weapons. In 1982, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der wrote a contribution in Die Zeit for the book Prinzip Leben, edited by Kelly and Jo Leinen, which discussed ecological problems and a possible nuclear war.\n\nIn the same year, Kelly received the Right Livelihood Award \"...for forging and implementing a new vision uniting ecological concerns with disarmament, social justice, and human rights.\"\n\nOn 12 May 1983, Kelly, Gert Bastian and three other Green Bundestag members unfurled a banner on Alexanderplatz in East Berlin, which said \"The Greens \u2013 Swords to Ploughshares\". After being briefly arrested, they met with East German opposition parties. The East German authorities tolerated this since the West German Greens repudiated the NATO Double-Track Decision. In October 1983, Erich Honecker, the leader of the German Democratic Republic, met Petra Kelly, Gert Bastian and other Greens. Kelly wore a pullover with the words \"Swords to Ploughshares\" on it. She demanded the release of all prisoners of the East German peace movement and asked Honecker why he repressed something in the GDR which he supported in the West.\n\nKelly wrote the book Fighting for Hope in 1984, published by South End Press. The book is an urgent call for a world free from violence between North and South, men and women, ourselves and our environment.\n\nIn the final years of her life, Kelly became increasingly estranged from most of her party colleagues owing to the pragmatic turn taken by the Greens at the time, while she continued to oppose any alliance with traditional political parties.\n\nDeath \n\nOn 19 October 1992, the decomposed bodies of Kelly and her partner, ex-general and Green politician Gert Bastian (born 1923), were discovered in the bedroom of her house in Bonn by police officials after they received a call from both Bastian's wife and Kelly's grandmother who reported that they had not heard from either Bastian or Kelly for a few weeks. The police determined that Kelly was shot dead while sleeping by Bastian, who then killed himself. She was 44, he was 69.  The last time anyone heard from the couple was on 30 September 1992 when Kelly sent a parcel to her grandmother. Police estimated the deaths had most likely occurred on 1 October but the exact time of death could not be pinpointed owing to the delay in finding the bodies and their resultant state of decomposition. Kelly was buried in the Waldfriedhof (forest cemetery) in W\u00fcrzburg, near the village of Heidingsfeld in Lower Franconia, Bavaria.\n\nHonors \n\n 1982: Right Livelihood Award\nIn 2006 Kelly was placed 45th in the UK Environment Agency's all-time list of scientists, campaigners, writers, economists and naturalists who, in its view, have done the most to save the planet. Kelly was positioned between the tropical ecologist Mike Hands and the national parks visionary John Dower.\n\nWorks \n\nKelly, Petra K. Thinking Green!

These analyses are both at the microeconomic and macroeconomic level. This field analyses the structures of households, the behavior of family members, and their broader influence on society, including: decision making, division of labour within the household, allocation of time to household production, marriage, divorce, fertility, investment in children, and resource allocation. \u00a0Malthus and Adam Smith studied the economics of the family in part by looking at the relationship between family size and living wage. \n\nSince the beginning of the 20th century, most economists have focused on business and monetary dimensions of the economy without consideration of household behaviour. The study of consumption and household production was marginalized by mainstream economics.  Economics theory applied to households, however, can address interactions between the public and private sectors of society in ways that inform tax policies surrounding education, welfare, and retirement benefits.\n\nHousehold economics can be divided into two models: the unitary model and the collective model.\n\nThe unitary model \nThe microeconomics approach of the household economics embodied by the unitary model was developed by Gary Becker. He developed the New Household Economics theory (NHE) and the A Treatise on the Family, written in 1981, was one this major work on the family economics and other aspects of the household economics. Becker's work has taken place at a time when the American and more generally Western family has been undergoing profound changes since the Second World War. His model helped to described resource allocation, utility maximization processes and decision making first in the USA and in the other developed countries. \n\nEconomists often assume that agents are rational, i.e. that they always choose the best possible choice given their own interests. Besides consumption decisions are described with the utility function. \u00a0\nThe unitary model described the household acting as a single individual. It does not take into account the plurality of decision-makers. The household utility function is unique and is under a common budget constraint. Becker resolved the problem of conflicts between household members thanks to his altruism model. The household maximize only one individual utility function which is the utility function of the altruistic member. The altruistic member transfers part of his or her resources to other members of the household. Becker said (1974): \"the utility function of the 'family' is identical to that of one of its members, not because he (or she) has dictatorial power over the others, but because he (or she!) cares enough about all the others to voluntarily transfer resources to them. Each member of the family can have total freedom of action; in fact, the person transferring the resources would not want to change the consumption of a family member even if he or she had dictatorial power!\u201d. So, the only way for the egoist members (all the other member of the household) to increase its utility function is to contribute to the increase in total household resources. \n\nHowever, this theory it has been contradicted by the study by Shelly Lundberg, Robert Pollak and Terence Wales [1997]. They show that the distribution and origin of income influence household consumption choices, which should not be the case in the unitary model. \n\nBesides Becker described the households as a consumption and production unit. He compares the household as a small factory in his household production function. It produces basic commodities and the household try to choose the best combination of these commodities to maximize its utility function. The production of the households depends on both the time available and the available income. The less time the household spends on leisure activities, the higher the household's income. According to Becker, if the salary of one of the household members increases, it changes the incentives to work in the market and the other members will give up their career to spend their time in consumption activities. However in this theory Becker ignored that people can like their job without regardless of the amount of the salary. \n\nBecker also developed a general theory of family behavior for decisions concerning marriage, divorce, children and fertility. According to Becker, parents have to decide how many children they want and how much money and time they are willing to spend on them. Becker thinks that when his income increases the household will focus more on the \"quality\" of the children and therefore the parents prefer to reduce the number of children. His theory explains the decline in fertility in industrialized countries. Regarding marriage, Becker shows that an individual will decide to marry if the marginal cost of marriage is equal to the marginal income of marriage. \n\nBecker's work has led to a new focus on the analysis of households and their decisions. However, his analysis present some weakness and it lacks theoretical support. First Becker neglects intrahousehold inequality but also the existence of power. The unitary model has been very strongly criticized by feminist economists.  \n\nThe non-unitary household models developed from the 1990s onwards therefore set out to compensate for the weaknesses of the unitary approach.\n\nThe collective model \nThe basic principles of these models are to characterize the preferences of each individual and to characterize the distribution factors. The collective model, unlike the unitary model, acknowledges the existence of inequalities within the household. \n\nThe collective approach was first developed by Pierre-Andre Chiappori (1992). There are two approach of collective models: cooperative, where household decisions are Pareto efficient, and noncooperative, based on Nash's equilibrium. \u00a0\n\nThe non-cooperative is based on non-cooperative provision of public goods. Each member has separate economies within the household. The provision of public goods is inefficient. The household members are not able to enter into efficient contract with each other.\n\nIn the cooperative model household decisions are Pareto efficient. The well-being of one household member cannot be increased without reducing the well-being of another member in the same household. maxUa +\u03bcUb \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u03bc= pareto weightEach member has its own preferences and an individual utility function. Under this model, the total income is divided among household members according to a sharing rule and then each one maximizes its utility on its own. The sharing rules are the basis for decisional process.\n\nSee also\n Breadwinner model\nFamily economics\n Outline of relationships\nStandard budget\n Jacob Mincer\n Grossbard-Shechtman\n Parental dividend\n Human capital\n\nReferences \n\nFamily economics\n\nGARY S.

The journal publishes articles, notes, and comments on subjects relating to environmental law, land-use law, and the regulation of natural resources.\n\nHistory and overview \nThe Harvard Environmental Law Review was founded in 1976 by Harvard Law School students Deborah Williams, James McDaniel, and Alan Gabbay; at the time, it was the school's fifth law journal. In a preface to the inaugural issue, former Harvard Law School dean Albert Sacks wrote that one of the journal's goals was to \"raise questions\" about whether environmental progress \"conforms to an intelligent and coherent set of goals.\" The founding editors explained that the goal of the inaugural issue was to cover recent developments in environmental law and policy. However, in its early years, the journal shifted its focus toward a wider range of topics because \"it was too ambitious to ask students to research and write a comprehensive overview of recent developments every year.\"\n\nImpact\nIn 2016, Washington and Lee University's Law Journal Rankings placed the journal as the top-ranked environmental, natural resources, and land use law journal according to combined score, impact factor, and journal citations. In his 1998 assessment of environmental law journals, Gregory Scott Crespi described the Harvard Environmental Law Review as a \"leading journal\" in its field.

The film premiered at the LA Film Festival in September 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on August 9, 2019.\n\nPlot\nBrian Banks (Aldis Hodge) is a 27-year-old former high school football star living with his mother (Sherri Shepherd) in Long Beach, California. He is currently on parole and registered as a sex offender due to an incident 11 years prior where he and a classmate, Kennisha (Xosha Roquemore), sneaked off to kiss. When he overheard teachers approaching, he fled to avoid getting caught, leading the scorned Kennisha to falsely accuse him of raping her.\n\nOn the advice of his attorney, Banks pled no contest to rape and was sentenced to six years of prison. His childhood dreams of becoming an NFL player are further damaged when new laws require him to wear an ankle monitor at all times and stay 2,000 feet away from schools and public gathering spots, preventing him from playing football, and he has trouble finding legitimate employment due to his criminal record.\n\nBanks approaches the California Innocence Project hoping to clear his name, and they advise him to write a plea of habeas corpus to the California legal system to get them to retry him. When this fails, Innocence Project founder Justin Brooks (Greg Kinnear) explains that the justice system requires new evidence that incontrovertibly points to his innocence before they will hear his pleas; this excludes DNA evidence, which was taken during the original trial but never used in his defense.\n\nInnocence Project lawyers interview several of Banks' former classmates, but their word is not strong enough to cast doubt on Banks' conviction. Banks unexpectedly receives a Facebook friend request from Kennisha, leading him to devise a scheme with several of his friends to trick her into confessing on tape that the rape allegation was fraudulent.\n\nThis seemingly succeeds, and Banks takes the tape to the Innocence Project. However, since Kennisha did not know she was being recorded, the evidence is inadmissible in court. Brooks sends the tape to the media, causing public outcry at the injustice of Banks' situation. Banks' parole officer calls him and warns him that his contact with Kennisha is a parole violation, but gives him until his parole expires before reporting the violation and placing Banks back in prison.\n\nBrooks approaches District Attorney Mateo (Jose Miguel Vasquez) and convinces him that Banks needs a new trial. Banks goes to court, but Kennisha refuses to testify and claims that Banks offered her $20,000 to say he didn't rape her on tape. Mateo and Brooks confront her and eventually get her to say on the record that her claim that Banks bribed her was a lie; this casts enough doubt on Banks' guilt to convince the judge to finally overturn Banks' conviction.\n\nBanks cuts off the ankle bracelet and heads to a local park, where he enjoys a game of football with some local children. The final narration reveals that Pete Carroll, a former University of Southern California coach who offered him a scholarship to USC during his high school days, invited him to try out for the Seattle Seahawks; failing to make the team due to his skills atrophying as a result of his extended time in prison, Banks trained hard over the next year and eventually was signed by the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nCast\nAldis Hodge as Brian Banks\nGreg Kinnear as Justin Brooks\nMelanie Liburd as Karina Cooper\nXosha Roquemore as Kennisha Rice\nTiffany Dupont as Alissa Bjerkhoel\nSherri Shepherd as Leomia\nJose Miguel Vasquez as District Attorney Mateo\nMorgan Freeman as Jerome Johnson (uncredited)\nDorian Missick as Officer Mick Randolph\n\nRelease\nThe film was theatrically released in the United States on August 9, 2019, to low box office results.\n\nBox office \nIn the United States and Canada, Brian Banks was released alongside The Kitchen, Dora and the Lost City of Gold, Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and The Art of Racing in the Rain, and was projected to gross around $2.5 million from 1,327 theaters in its opening weekend.

It is situated on the Nuthe river north of the Fl\u00e4ming Heath, at the eastern rim of the Nuthe-Nieplitz Nature Park, about  south of Berlin. The town area includes the villages of Frankenfelde and Kolzenburg.\n\nOverview\n\nThe former Slavic settlement of Lugkin was conquered by Margrave Conrad Wettin of Meissen in the course of the 1147 Wendish Crusade. Lukenwalde Castle was first mentioned in a 1216 deed as a burgward of the Bishopric of Brandenburg, it was acquired by Zinna Abbey in 1285. Together with Zinna it remained under the rule of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and its successor, the Prussian Duchy of Magdeburg until it was attached to the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1773.\n\nOriginating in the 17th century, Luckenwalde's cloth and wool factories did not spring up till the reign of King Frederick II of Prussia and soon were among the most extensive in Germany. Other traditional industries were cotton printing and a dye works, brewing, and the making of metal and bronze goods. In 1808 Luckenwalde officially received town privileges.\n\nBy the turn of the 20th Century Luckenwalde became renowned as a key manufacturer of hats. In 1921 the two biggest hat ateliers, Herrmann and Steinberg, merged and set up their factory on an industrial estate in Luckenwalde. The factory was designed by German architect Erich Mendelsohn in 1923, the factory is considered a milestone of Expressionist architecture. The hat factory fell into disrepair during and after the war period and was restored in 2001, but as of 2013 the building remains empty.\n\nDuring World War II, there was a Stalag for prisoners of war (Stalag III-A). There was also a work camp for civilians. The Nazis forced people to work for their war effort or else the families of people who worked there would perish. Lack of food and hard work killed thousands. Among them were Poles, Italians, French and many more. There were several places in the town and surrounding areas where they worked.  Luckenwalde was taken by the Red Army on 22 April 1945.\n\nDemography\n\nPolitics\nSeats in the municipal assembly (Stadtverordnetenversammlung) as of 2014 elections:\nThe Left: 10\nSocial Democratic Party of Germany (SPD): 9\nChristian Democratic Union (CDU): 6\nBauernverband (BV): 1\nFree Democratic Party (FDP): 1\nNational Democratic Party of Germany (NPD): 1\n\nTransport\nLuckenwalde station is located on the Berlin\u2013Halle railway.\n\nNotable people\n Marianne Adam (born 1951), shot putter\n Carl (Carlos) Anwandter (1801\u20131889), 1848 revolutionary, emigre to Chile\n Ilka Bessin (born 1971), comedian (Cindy aus Marzahn)\n Rudi Dutschke (1940\u20131979), spokesman of the German 1968 student movement, attended school in Luckenwalde\n Hans Freudenthal (1905\u20131990), mathematician\n Hans Grohe (1871\u20131955), industrialist\n Michael Hanack (1931\u20132019), chemist\n Carl Harries (1866\u20131923), chemist\n Hans-Joachim Hecht (born 1939 ), chess master\n David Hollwitz (born 1989), footballer\n Bernhard Kadenbach (born 1933), biochemist\n Paul Koebe (1882\u20131945), mathematician\n Niklas Kohrt (born 1980), actor\n Hans Krueger (1909\u20131988), Gestapo officer and Holocaust perpetrator, attended school in Luckenwalde\n Susanne Lahme (born 1951), volleyball player\n Werner Lamberz (1929\u20131978), senior politician in the GDR, apprenticed in Luckenwalde\n Carla Nelte (born 1990), badminton player\n Maria Nicklisch (1904\u20131995), stage actress\n Katherina Reiche (born 1973), politician (CDU)\n Heinz-Joachim Rothenburg (born 1944), shot putter\n Herbert Schoen (1929\u20132014), footballer\n Franz Urbig (1864\u20131944), banker\n\nInternational relations\n\nLuckenwalde is twinned with:\n Dieppe, Seine-Maritime, France\n Bad Salzuflen, Germany\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nNotgeld (emergency banknotes) depicting the industries Luckenwalde was known for in the early 20th century. http://webgerman.com/Notgeld/Directory/L/Luckenwalde.htm\n\nLocalities in Teltow-Fl\u00e4ming", "Vice-Admiral Sir Thomas Bertie KSO (born Hoar, 3 July 1758 \u2013 13 June 1825) was an English officer of the Royal Navy who served during the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.\n\nHis career began in the East Indies, where he served aboard the frigate  with two fellow youths Horatio Nelson and Thomas Troubridge who he would remain in contact with as they each rose through the ranks in the navy. He eventually spent most of his youth serving in the West Indies and off the American coasts during the American War of Independence, seeing action in a number of battles with the French. He was a commander by the end of the war, but peace left him without a ship or promotion prospects. He married during the period of peace, taking the surname Bertie in accordance with his father-in-law's will, and also used his time ashore to carry out experiments that led to the introduction of lifebuoys to the navy. Returning to active service during the wars with revolutionary France, Bertie commanded a number of ships, often in the North Sea or the English Channel. His experience led to him being assigned to the expedition to the Baltic with Sir Hyde Parker and his old friend Horatio Nelson. Bertie was involved in the fierce fighting during the Battle of Copenhagen, and received Nelson's praise for his actions. This was the start of Bertie's long association with the Baltic, both as a captain, and after his promotion to rear-admiral. His good service led to a knighthood and an appointment to the Swedish Order of the Sword, but seriously weakened his health. He was obliged to resign his command in 1810, and went into retirement, dying in 1825.\n\nFamily and early life\nBertie was born Thomas Hoar on 3 July 1758 in Stockton-on-Tees, County Durham, the sixth child and fourth son of George Hoar, the Keeper of the Regalia of England at the Tower of London, and his wife Francis. His name was entered into the books of the yacht HMY William & Mary in March 1771, when he was just twelve years old, but this was only for seniority, and he spent his early life being educated, first at a navigation school in his native Stockton, followed by a move to London to attend Mr Eaton's academy, and then Christ's Hospital. He first went to sea in October 1773, joining the 24-gun  under Captain George Farmer. \n\nAlso serving aboard the Seahorse as midshipman and able seaman respectively were the young Horatio Nelson and Thomas Troubridge. The three future admirals became good friends and would remain in correspondence with each other throughout their lives. \n\nHoar transferred to the 50-gun  under Commodore Sir Edward Hughes on 27 June 1777 at the instigation of Hoar's patron, Lord Mulgrave, and returned to England on 14 May 1778. He was promoted to lieutenant on 21 May that year, and appointed to serve aboard the 74-gun  under Joshua Rowley. \n\nWith Rowley, he was present at the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778, and in December moved with Rowley to the 74-gun .\n\nRowley and Hoar sailed to the West Indies to support operations there against the French fleets. Hoar saw action with Admiral John Byron's fleet at the Battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779, and then in two subsequent boat actions in December off Martinique. Hoar continued to serve under Rowley, accompanying him when he moved his flag to the 74-gun  in March 1780. \n\nWith Rowley, Hoar saw action against the Comte d'Estaing at the Battle of Martinique on 17 April, and in two indecisive actions on 15 and 19 May. Rowley made Hoar his flag-lieutenant for his good service in July, and on 10 August 1782 Hoar was promoted to commander, and given command of the 16-gun sloop  based at Port Royal. He remained in this position until the end of the war, at which his ship was paid off after her return to England in August 1783.\n\nInterwar period and marriage\nHoar remained on half-pay at the rank of commander for the years between the end of the American War of Independence, and the start of the French Revolutionary Wars. He married during this time ashore, taking as his wife Catherine Dorothy Bertie, daughter of Peregrine Bertie. The couple were married at St Marylebone Parish Church on 20 May 1788, after which Hoar took the surname Bertie, in accordance with his father-in-law's will. Also in 1788 he carried out a series of experiments at Spithead, that led to the introduction of lifebuoys into the navy.\n\nThe Nootka Crisis in 1790 led to Bertie receiving his long delayed promotion to post-captain, on 22 November 1790. He received the command of  but the easing of tensions led to her being paid off and Bertie was left without a ship. This continued even after the start of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793, until September 1795, when he took command of the 54-gun  with orders to serve in the West Indies.\n\nCommand\nBertie followed through on his orders, but while serving at Port-au-Prince in the West Indies he suffered a severe attack of yellow fever, and was invalided home in October 1796. He recovered his health and on 29 March 1797 he was appointed to command the 54-gun  at Plymouth. He was part of the court that court-martialled Captain John Williamson for misconduct during the Battle of Camperdown, and afterwards received an appointment to command the 64-gun  in the North Sea. Nelson wrote to congratulate Bertie, calling the Ardent 'the finest man-of-war upon her decks that ever I saw.' While in command of the Ardent he developed a slight alteration to the 42pdr carronades carried on her main deck. Bertie observed that if the chock were depressed by two inches, the gun could be worked and run out with a smaller number of people, while the recoil was reduced and the force of the shot increased. Bertie reported this to the Board of Ordnance, which subsequently adopted the modification for all the ships in the fleet.\n\nNorth Sea and Baltic\nBertie spent the next few years in the North Sea and in blockading the Texel, initially under Admiral Adam Duncan until August 1799, and then Vice-Admiral Andrew Mitchell. After the surrender of the Dutch fleet to Mitchell in the Vlieter Incident on 30 August, Bertie was ordered to take possession of the 68-gun De Ruyter, and then to escort the rest of the prizes to the Nore, arriving there on 10 September. After the failure of the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, Bertie assisted in the evacuation and received the thanks of Parliament. He then took part in Vice-Admiral Archibald Dickson's expedition to Copenhagen in support of Lord Whitworth's diplomatic mission. Bertie returned to Copenhagen in 1801, with Sir Hyde Parker's expedition, and was detached to join his old friend Nelson's division for the attack on the city.\n\nBertie and the Ardent were duly engaged in the thick of the fighting, eventually suffering 29 killed and 64 wounded, with another 40 being slightly wounded but able to continue working. During the battle the Ardent forced the surrender of four Danish ships and floating batteries, causing Nelson to come aboard the Ardent the day after the battle to deliver his personal commendations to Ardents officers and men for their actions. On 9 April Parker moved Bertie to the 74-gun , replacing her captain, Thomas Boulden Thompson, who had lost a leg in the battle and was temporarily hors de combat. Bertie spent the next year serving in the Baltic, first under Nelson, and then under his successor, Sir Charles Pole.\n\nCadiz and West Indies\nBertie was sent home in July 1802 with a squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Graves, and went from there to Cadiz, via Cork, in order to blockade the Spanish fleet there. The Peace of Amiens led to his return to England again, but he was soon sent to sea again as part of Charles Tyler's squadron despatched to the West Indies. He returned to Britain in June, where the Bellona was paid off.\n\nResumption of war\nThe resumption of hostilities in 1803 led to Bertie taking command of the 74-gun  on 3 November. The Courageaux became the flagship of Rear-Admiral James Richard Dacres, and in January Bertie attempted to organise a convoy to the West Indies. Soon after leaving Britain a gale blew up, causing considerable damage to the ship and forcing Bertie to return to Britain. Before he could return to sea, a sudden family crisis forced Bertie to resign his command, not returning to active service until December 1805. In that month he was given command of the 98-gun , commanding her in the English Channel. He was promoted to rear-admiral on 28 April 1808, and was requested to serve in the Baltic by Sir James Saumarez.\n\nFlag rank and later life\nHe flew his flag initially from the 74-gun , followed by the 74-gun  and the 64-gun . After a brief return to Britain in January 1809, he returned to the Baltic in March 1809 aboard the 64-gun , where he spent most of the year. He returned to Britain in December, and in February 1810 was obliged to strike his flag owing to his poor health. He was knighted on 24 June 1813 and authorised to accept the award of the Swedish Order of the Sword. He was advanced to a vice-admiral on 4 December 1813. He died at Twyford Lodge, Hampshire, the home of his brother, on 13 June 1825.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n1758 births\n1825 deaths\nRoyal Navy vice admirals\nRoyal Navy personnel of the French Revolutionary Wars\nRoyal Navy personnel of the Napoleonic Wars\nKnights Bachelor\nPeople from Stockton-on-Tees\nPeople educated at Christ's Hospital\nRoyal Navy personnel of the American Revolutionary War\nKnights of the Order of the Sword", "I'm Gone may refer to:\n I'm Off, a 1999 novel by Jean Echenoz, also known as I'm Gone\n \"I'm Gone\" (George Fox song), 1998\n \"I'm Gone\" (Cyndi Thomson song), 2002\n \"I'm Gone\" (Jordan Pruitt song), 2008\n \"I'm Gone\" (Tyga song), 2012\n \"I'm Gone\", a song by Dolly Parton from Halos & Horns\n \"I'm Gone\" (Joyryde song), 2019\n \"I'm Gone\", a song by DJ Kay Slay from The Streetsweeper, Vol. 2\n \"I'm Gone\", a song by Jay Sean from All or Nothing", "\"god MC\" is a hip hop song by Ghanaian artist M.anifest released on June 30, 2016.

According to the 2002 census, the village has a population of 685 people.\n\nName\n\"Ostrovo\" means \"island\" in Serbian. This name originates from the fact that Ostrovo is located on former Danube island (see: Ostrovo (island)) that historically was part of Banat region. In Serbian, the village is known as Ostrovo (\u041e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e), in German as Ostrova, and in Hungarian as Temessziget.\n\nHistory\nVillage was formed during the Great Serb migration, led by Arsenije \u010carnojevi\u0107. Until 1751, Ostrovo was part of the Habsburg Banat of Temeswar and then part of the Habsburg Military Frontier. From 1848 to 1849, it was part of Serbian Vojvodina, but in 1849 it was again included into Military Frontier. After abolishment of the frontier, in 1873, Ostrovo was included into Temes County of the Kingdom of Hungary and Austria-Hungary. It was part of the Kovin municipality within the county. According to 1910 census, ethnic Serbs were in absolute majority in Ostrovo. Other ethnic groups that lived in the village were Germans, Hungarians and Romanians.\n\nIn 1918, Ostrovo first became part of the Kingdom of Serbia and then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (which was renamed to Yugoslavia in 1929). From 1918 to 1922, it was part of the Veliki Be\u010dkerek county, from 1922 to 1929 part of the Podunavlje oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of Danube Banovina. From 1941 to 1944, it was part of Serbia, which was under German occupation. In 1942, Germans built an embankment that transformed island on which Ostrovo was located into an peninsula, connecting it with the southern bank of the Danube. After the war, Ostrovo became part of the new socialist Yugoslavia whose authorities transferred the village from Kovin municipality to Po\u017earevac municipality. Therefore, unlike the most of historical Serbian Banat, Ostrovo was included into Central Serbia and not into Autonomous Province of Vojvodina. Despite this administrative change, the village still belongs to the Banat eparchy of the Serbian Orthodox Church.\n\nIn 2007, municipality of Po\u017earevac was elevated to city status, and in 2009, an urban municipality of Kostolac was formed, as part of the city of Po\u017earevac. Ostrovo was also included into newly formed Kostolac municipality.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2002, population of Ostrovo numbered 685 inhabitants, including 583 Serbs, 95 people of unknown ethnicity, 3 Hungarians, 3 Macedonians, and 1 Montenegrin.\n\nSee also\nPopulated places of Serbia\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nPoreznici u Po\u017earevcu, crkva u Vr\u0161cu\nwww.ostrovo.com\nAbout Ostrovo coat of arms\n\nPopulated places in Brani\u010devo District", "Raffique Shah (born 1946) is a Trinidad and Tobago trade union leader and political commentator.  He is also a former Member of Parliament and mutineer, having led a mutiny of Trinidad and Tobago Regiment in 1970.\n\nBiography\nShah was born the son of a sugarcane worker and housewife in March 1946. His early education was at Presentation College, Chaguanas, where he gained a Grade I Cambridge School Certificate. He later won a cadetship to the prestigious British Royal Military Academy Sandhurst between 1964 and 1966.\n\nAs a lieutenant in the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment, he led an army mutiny in 1970.  In the midst of Black Power riots, the People's National Movement government led by Eric Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency in April 1970 and arrested several Black Power leaders and Trade Unionists.  In a move to prevent Williams from using the military against the masses, a portion of the Regiment stationed at Teteron (on the Chaguaramas Peninsula), led by Lieutenants Shah and Rex Lassalle mutinied.  In response, the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard fired on the mutineers who returned to Teteron Barracks, abandoning their foray into Port of Spain.  After 10 days, the mutineers surrendered.  The leaders were court-martialed and Shah and Lasalle were jailed. They both went on to win their appeals at the local Court of Appeal, and judges at the Privy Council in London, England, ruled against the State's appeal in July 1972. Shah, Lassalle and all the other mutineers were freed within 24 hours of that ruling.\n\nAfter being released from prison Shah joined the Trade Union movement leading the ICFTU, a body of cane farmers who sought to displace the government-recognised organisation, TICFA (Trinidad Islandwide Cane Farmers' Association). Shah, George Weekes and Basdeo Panday went on to found the United Labour Front (ULF) in 1975 as a labour confederation and transformed it into a political party in 1976. During general election later that year, the ULF secured 10 of the 36 seats in Parliament and became the official Opposition.  Basdeo Panday was appointed Leader of the Opposition, but following a bitter row in the party, Shah was able to displace him, and served as Leader of the Opposition between August 9, 1977 and March 31, 1978 when Panday regained control of the party.\n\nShah went on to lead the cane farmers and won an election to head the Trinidad Island-wide Cane Farmers' Association (TICFA), in 1998. He has been chairman of that organisation to date. Shah also served as editor of the Trinidad and Tobago Mirror newspaper for 17 years and went on to serve as an op-ed columnist in the Trinidad and Tobago Express newspaper.

He attended King's College, Lagos and went on to study law. In his book 888 Days in Biafra, Samuel Enadeghe Umweni recollects how Lawyer Akpata twice made the dangerous journey across the front lines to visit him while he was held prisoner by the breakaway Biafran troops during the Nigerian Civil War (1967\u20131970).\nAkpata became a justice of the Supreme court, retiring in 1993 at the age of 65. \nHe was appointed to head the INEC in 1998 when General Abdulsalam Abubakar's Administration established the INEC to organise the transitional elections that ushered in the Nigerian Fourth Republic on 29 May 1999.\n\nFormation of parties\n\nTo avoid splits along ethnic lines, Akpata stipulated that only parties with broad-based national support would be allowed to contest the elections. He ruled that political parties must win local government electoral seats in at least ten states to qualify for the gubernatorial, state assembly, national assembly and presidential elections.\nOf 26 political associations, he gave provisional registration as political parties for the 1998/1999 elections to only nine, with only three parties finally qualifying to compete in the State and National elections.\nThis caused the formation of coalitions of smaller associations, such as the Group of 34 which formed the new People's Democratic Party (PDP).\n\nCoalitions had to become genuine parties. In January 1999 Akpata said that the electoral alliance announced between the Alliance for Democracy (AD) and All People's Party (APP) \"appeared to contravene INEC rules\". He said the two parties wanted to \"derive the benefits of a merger without going through with one\".\nAkpata was critical of the process through which the PDP selected its candidates, saying it fell \"short of the level of transparency expected from a democratic process.\"\n\nElections\n\nThe INEC ran a series of elections. Local Government polls were held in December 1998, with the PDP winning 59%, the APP 25.8% and the AD 13.2% of the seats.\nElections for the Governorships were held in January 1999, with the PDP winning 19 out of 35 states, the APP winning 9 states and the AD winning 6 states. The elections were largely orderly and peaceful, and Akpata said they were free and fair.\nThe elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate were held in February 1999. In the Senate the PDP won 59 seats, the APP 29 and the AD 20. In the House, the PDP won 206 seats, the APP 74 and the AD 68. Elections were delayed due to security reasons in Akwa Ibom, Delta, Nasarawa and Rivers states. Akpata told a news conference that although generally fair, there had been some voting irregularities.\nIn the 27 February 1999 presidential elections, the AD and APP fielded a joint candidate, Chief Olu Falae, who lost to the PDP candidate, former General and military ruler Olusegun Obasanjo. Obasanjo gained 63% of the votes.\n\nAkpata accepted foreign election monitors from the US-based Carter Center and the National Democratic Institute, and supported their request to train thousands of local observers. Reports from these groups on the earlier elections were generally favourable, although they noted low turn out and some irregularities. Reports on later elections were more critical, describing irregularities including inflated vote returns, ballot box stuffing, altered results, and disenfranchisement of voters.\nAfter the elections, former US President Jimmy Carter sent a letter to Akapata that said \"There was a wide disparity between the number of voters observed at\nthe polling stations and the final results that have been reported from several states. Regrettably, therefore, it is not possible for us to make an accurate judgment about the outcome of the presidential election.\"\nOlu Falae later alleged that the election was massively rigged in favour of the PDP.\n\nJustice Ephraim Akpata died on 8 January 2000 at the age of 72.\n\nBibliography\n\nReferences\n\n1927 births\n2000 deaths\nMembers of the Independent National Electoral Commission\n20th-century Nigerian lawyers\nNigerian Civil War prisoners of war\nKing's College, Lagos alumni\nSupreme Court of Nigeria justices", "Frank Fujita (October 20, 1921 \u2013 December 11, 1996) was a Japanese American soldier of the US Army who, during his service in World War II became one of only two Japanese American combat personnel (the other being Richard Sakakida) to be captured by the Japanese. Part of the 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery of the 36th Infantry Division (which was later known as the \"Lost Battalion\"), Texas National Guard, he was captured during the Battle of Java when the Dutch surrendered.\n\nA prisoner held in Japan for three and a half years, Fujita later published a memoir of his experience, Foo: A Japanese-American Prisoner of the Rising Sun. His work, along with those of John David Provoo and W. F. Matthews, fellow \"Lost Battalion\" prisoners of war, has served as a useful historical reference for the experience of American prisoners of war held in Japan.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly years\nFujita's father was born in a village near Nagasaki, Japan, and after learning English while at school he was sent to the United States to learn American methods of agriculture. Arriving in June 1914, he took a Western name and became embroiled in gambling in Los Angeles. He worked for the Salvation Army before training as a chef on the Rock Island Rail Road. He met his future wife, Isa Pearl Elliott, in a hotel within Rock Island, Illinois, and the two were married in 1919.\n\nFujita was the second of five children, born on October 20, 1921, in Lawton while his father worked in the food industry in Oklahoma, enhancing his income further with gambling wins and moonlighting in artistry and sign painting. Fujita and his siblings were encouraged to absorb the culture of the United States and become \"one hundred percent American\". Fujita joined the American Boy Scouts upon moving to El Reno, and survived well under his father's healthy income during the Great Depression. It was at this time that he earned the nickname \"Foo\", based on a childhood pet. His drawings of this cat attracted local media interest from The Abilene Reporter News in 1937, a local newspaper from Abilene, Texas. He obtained work as a cartoonist for a local school newspaper and as a stage hand in various theatre plays.\n\nEnlistment\nFujita became interested in joining the military after hearing of his friend's enjoyment of the Texas National Guard. He enlisted after a lengthy debate between the National Guard and the civics teacher of the local high school debating the legitimacy of his claim to American citizenship, as well as questions over his weight, height and age, all three of which were below the minimum level. Made a PFC and a chauffeur for the battalion officers, Fujita progressed well in the National Guard though struggled at home with his studies. After accepting an ultimatum from his father to work harder or leave, Fujita chose to hitch-hike to Oklahoma and became an artist and illustrator. On the outbreak of war in 1939, he returned to his National Guard unit, taking part in training manoeuvres through 1940.\n\nCome November, with Fujita by now a sergeant, the unit was mobilized and sent to San Francisco and then Louisiana. In 1941, he was shipped overseas aboard the Republic.\n\nBattle of Java\n\nJapanese landings\nDuring the Battle of the Java Sea on 27 February 1942, the Allied navies suffered a disastrous defeat at the hand of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDA) Strike Force commander\u2014Admiral Karel Doorman\u2014was killed. What followed was several landings on the island of Java on March 1. The Allied forces were commanded by the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) commander, General Hein ter Poorten. Although the KNIL forces had, on paper, 25,000 (mostly Indonesian) well-armed troops, many were poorly trained. The Japanese troops landed at three points on Java on 1 March. The West Java invasion convoy landed on Bantam Bay near Merak and Eretan Wetan, having defeated HMAS Perth and USS Houston at the Battle of Sunda Strait, a few hours prior to landing. The East Java invasion convoy landed on Kragan.\n\nLand campaign \n\nJapanese troops, mainly from the 48th Division, landed at three points on Java on March 1.\n\nThe Dutch and other Allied forces were organized in four sub-commands: Batavia (Jakarta); North Central Java; South Java and East Java.\n\nAs the only US ground forces in Java, the main body of the 2nd Battalion, 131st Field Artillery was attached to an Australian Army formation named Blackforce after its commander, Brigadier Arthur Blackburn. The Australians lacked infantry units, but included a heavy machine gun battalion, a pioneer battalion, several smaller units, some reinforcements diverted en route to Singapore after the  Allied surrender there, a handful of Australian soldiers who had escaped from Singapore, two transport companies, and a casualty clearing station. From these units, Blackburn organized three makeshift infantry battalions.\n\nHowever, \"E\" Battery, 2/131st Field Artillery, including Frank Fujita, were attached to Dutch infantry in Central and East Java.\n\nOn March 2, at Leuwiliang, 15 miles (24\u00a0km) west of Buitenzorg, \"D\" Battery, 2/131st Field Artillery, supported the makeshift Australian infantry, positioned along a riverbank. The Allies put up a vigorous defence. Volleys from \"D\" Battery reportedly destroyed many Japanese tanks and trucks. Blackforce managed to hold up the Japanese advance for two full days before being forced to withdraw to Soekabumi, lest it become trapped by Japanese flanking manoeuvres, and was ordered to retreat to Soekabumi.\n\nThe Japanese quickly overwhelmed the Allied defences in most other areas. However, at Porong, near Surabaya, the Texans of \"E\" Battery, including Frank Fujita, supported the Dutch 8th and 13th Infantry Battalions, as well as the Dutch 3rd Cavalry Unit, in giving fierce resistance to the incoming Japanese.\n\nAllied surrender \nBy 7 March, defeat was inevitable, with Tjilatjap already in Japanese hands. Soerabaja was being evacuated while Japanese troops were rapidly converging on Bandoeng from both the north and the west. At 09:00 on 8 March, the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces \u2014 Ter Poorten \u2014 announced the surrender of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army in Java. At 23:00, the Dutch radio station NIROM (Nederlandsch Indische Radio Omroep Maatschappij) broadcast the last news from a temporary transmitter at Ciumbuleuit. The announcer Bert Garthoff ended the broadcast with the words \"Wij sluiten nu. Vaarwel tot betere tijden. Leve de Koningin!\" (We are closing now. Farewell till better times. Long live the Queen!) The Dutch Governor, Jonkheer Dr. A.W.L. Tjarda Van Starkenborgh Stachouwer and Lieutenant-General Ter Poorten, together with Major-General Jacob J. Pesman, the commander of the Bandoeng District, met the Japanese Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant-General Hitoshi Imamura at Kalidjati that afternoon and agreed to the capitulation of all the troops. Fujita was captured along 550 other members of what became known as the \"Lost Battalion\".\n\nInternment\nFujita was a prisoner of war for three and a half years. He spent the majority of his internment in Omori Prison Island in Tokyo Bay, but was also imprisoned in Surabaja and Changi Prison in Singapore after initial capture. He was for a time in the company of fellow prisoner John David Provoo.\n\nDue to his ethnicity, Fujita was separated from other American prisoners and forced to produce  propaganda broadcasts for the Japanese.\n\nLiberation\nOn August 29, 1945, Fujita and 300 other survivors from his battalion were among the first American prisoners to be liberated.\n\nLike most of his fellow inmates, Fujita was returned to the United States over a period of several weeks in late 1945. Fujita travelled via train to Texas, and via bus to Abilene, arriving in October. He recorded later that \"I walked past my mother and baby sister without recognizing them. My mom must have been drowsy, or the sight of me froze her to immobility, for I was two or three people past her before she came into action.\"\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1921 births\n1996 deaths\nJapanese-American internees\nPeople from Lawton, Oklahoma\nUnited States Army personnel of World War II\nAmerican military personnel of Japanese descent\n20th-century American writers\n20th-century American male writers\nUnited States Army soldiers", "Caleb Darrell Holman (born January 7, 1984) is an American former professional stock car racing driver. He last competed part-time in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, driving the No. 75 Toyota Tundra and Chevrolet Silverado for Henderson Motorsports.\n\nRacing career\n\nEarly years \nThe son of an amateur racer, Holman started racing by running go-karts and late models during his teenage years, culminating with two ARCA Racing Series starts at age nineteen.\n\nX-1R Pro Cup \nStarting in 2007, Holman raced mainly in the Pro Cup Series. He collected his first win in 2008 on his way to a sixth-place points finish. In 2009, Holman secured three poles in twelve races but could not close the deal in any of them. A dominant 2010 season ensued in which he won four races and finished runner-up, the closest finish yet to a championship. Holman backed up those results in 2011 when he led all but five races and recorded top tens in all but three. The efforts were scaled back in 2012 as Holman started to move up to the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. In 2013, he won two races while running half the fourteen-race schedule. Returning to the series full-time in 2014, Holman won half the races, including the final four to win the championship. He earned almost $70,000 for that championship.\n\nNASCAR \nHolman started racing in the NASCAR Busch Grand National (now Xfinity) series in 2003. He attempted five races, qualified for two and finished one, at the Milwaukee Mile. He then made one race for Ortec Racing in 2004. He then teamed up with Henderson Motorsports for the first time two years later, attempting five races and qualifying for one. His one attempt with the team in 2007 ended in a crash.\n\nStarting in 2012, Holman rekindled his relationship with Henderson to run a partial Camping World Truck Series schedule, mostly on short tracks. In 2013, Holman branched out to superspeedways, running for Henderson in the race at Talladega Superspeedway, but he crashed out, though he ran well on short tracks. Once again entering a restrictor plate race and short track races, Holman almost made the top ten at Martinsville Speedway in 2014.  He was running in the top ten, but contact with David Starr resulted in a flat tire. Continuing his partial schedule in 2015, Holman recorded his first top ten at Martinsville with sponsorship from Tide Pods. He recorded his first intermediate track top ten in 2015, and won time trials at Eldora, but was wrecked by Stewart Friesen.  Holman announced his retirement from NASCAR events via Facebook on September 19, 2017 to become a leader at his church.\n\nMotorsports career results\n\nNASCAR\n(key) (Bold\u00a0\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

Though not a founding member, Grill was the longest-serving member of the band prior to his death in 2011.\n\nCareer\nGrill was a native of Hollywood, California, where he attended Hollywood High School. Soon after graduation, he began working at American Recording Studios with musician friends Cory Wells and John Kay (who later formed Three Dog Night and Steppenwolf, respectively).\n\nGrill was asked to join The Grass Roots, which grew out of a project originating from Dunhill Records owned by Lou Adler. Writers/producers P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri (The Mamas & the Papas, Tommy Roe, Four Tops and Dusty Springfield) were asked by Dunhill to write songs that would capitalize on the growing interest in the folk-rock movement. After their song \u201cWhere Were You When I Needed You\u201d \u2014 recorded as a demo with P.F. Sloan as lead singer \u2014 was released under the name \u201cThe Grass Roots\u201d and received airplay in the San Francisco Bay Area, Dunhill searched for a band to become The Grass Roots. After the first group they chose departed, a Los Angeles band composed of Creed Bratton, Rick Coonce, Warren Entner, and Kenny Fukomoto was recruited to become The Grass Roots.\n\nWhen Fukumoto was drafted into the army, Grill was brought in as his replacement. With Grill as lead singer, they recorded another version of \"Where Were You When I Needed You\" and he became the band\u2019s longest serving member, appearing with them for more than four decades. Grill went on to produce and manage the band and became owner of The Grass Roots name.\n\nClassic rock festivals\n\nThe Grass Roots played at the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival on Sunday, June 11, 1967, in the \"summer of love\" as their top ten hit \"Let's Live For Today\" was hitting the airwaves. This music festival is important because it occurred before the Monterey Pop Festival but did not have a movie to document it for the ages (see List of electronic music festivals).  On Sunday, October 27, 1968, they played at the San Francisco Pop Festival and then played at the Los Angeles Pop Festival and Miami Pop Festival in December of that year as their top 10 hit \"Midnight Confessions\" was hitting the airwaves.\n\nThe Grass Roots played at Newport Pop Festival 1969 at Devonshire Downs which was a racetrack at the time but now is part of the North Campus for California State University at Northridge. They played on Sunday June 22 which was the final day of the festival as their top twenty hit \"Wait A Million Years\" was hitting the airwaves. In Canada, they played at the Vancouver Pop Festival at the Paradise Valley Resort in British Columbia in August 1969 (see List of electronic music festivals).\n\nSolo career & 60's nostalgia\n\nGrill launched a solo career in 1979, assisted on his solo album by several members of Fleetwood Mac. Responding to '60s nostalgia, Grill then led The Grass Roots (billed \"The Grass Roots Starring Rob Grill\") and toured the United States until his death in 2011.\n\nCompositions and musical release performance\n\nGrill composed sixteen songs for The Grass Roots and his solo album. One of these,  \"Come On and Say It\", appeared as a single \"A\" side. His other 15 compositions appeared on single \"B\" sides and albums. He wrote frequently with Warren Entner and they were considered a songwriting team. Grill played with The Grass Roots on 16 albums, seven of which charted. He took part in 32 Grass Roots singles released, 21 of which charted.\n\nDeath\nGrill died from complications of a head injury sustained in a fall in June 2011. After suffering two strokes following the fall, each located in different parts of his brain, he fell into a coma. With his wife Nancy by his side, Grill died July 11, 2011 in an Orlando, Florida hospital from complications after a stroke.\n\nDiscography\n\nSingles\n\n+ - Gold Record - RIAA Certification\n\nAlbums\n\n(All albums are with the Grass Roots, unless otherwise noted)\n\n+ - Gold Record - RIAA Certification\n\nReferences \n\nAmerican male singer-songwriters\nAmerican rock songwriters\nAmerican rock singers\nAmerican rock bass guitarists\nAmerican male bass guitarists\n20th-century American singers\nSingers from Los Angeles\n1943 births\n2011 deaths\nGuitarists from Los Angeles\n20th-century American bass guitarists\n20th-century American male singers\nSinger-songwriters from California", "Fade \u00e8 il quarto album dei Vain, uscito nel 1995 per l'Etichetta discografica Polystar Records.\n\nTracce\nHoldin' On (Vain)\nShooting Star (Vain)\nQuick Step to Love (Vain)\nPowder Blue (Vain)\nDee Dee (Vain)\nLanguish (Vain)\nHollow and Spun (Vain)\nVoyeurism (Vain)\nLayin' Low (Vain)\nCan't Get Back (Vain)\n\nFormazione\n Davy Vain - voce\n Danny West - chitarra\n James Scott - chitarra\n Ashley Mitchell - basso\n Louie Senor - batteria\n\nAltri musicisti\n Shawn Rorie - chitarra\n Tom Rickard - batteria\n Steven Adler - batteria", "The MEGAL pipeline () is a major natural gas pipeline system in southern Germany. It transports natural gas from the Czech\u2013German and Austrian\u2013German borders to the German\u2013French border.\n\nHistory\nConstruction started in 1975 when Ruhrgas and Gaz de France formed a partnership (Mittel-Europ\u00e4ische-Gasleitungsgesellschaft) for transportation of Russian natural gas to France and southern Germany. The pipeline was commissioned in 1980.  The pipeline cost \u20ac634\u00a0million.\n\nIn July 2009, the European Commission fined GDF Suez, now Engie and E.ON \u20ac553\u00a0million each due to collusion on the MEGAL pipeline. Commission officials claimed there was a deal between the two groups\u2019 predecessor companies \u2013 Gaz de France and Ruhrgas \u2013 not to sell gas sent via MEGAL into each other's home markets dating from the mid-1970s. The Commission alleged that the companies maintained these arrangements after European gas markets were liberalised despite knowing that the 1975 deal violated competition rules.  They are the second largest fines imposed by the European Commission and the first on the energy sector.  The decision is contested by both companies, who argue that the business rules in 1975 differed from those of today.  In 1975, Ruhrgas and Gaz de France concluded arrangements according to which they agreed not to sell gas in each other's home market. The deal was abandoned in 2005.\n\nTechnical description\nThe pipeline system is  long.  It comprises two interconnected pipelines\u2014MEGAL Nord and MEGAL S\u00fcd.  The MEGAL Nord pipeline consists of two parallel pipelines with a length of  and  from Waidhaus to Medelsheim. It is operated at a pressure of 80\u00a0bar (1,160 psi), which is secured by three compressor stations.  The capacity of the pipeline is 22\u00a0billion cubic metres (777\u00a0billion cubic feet) of natural gas per year, or a little more than 60\u00a0million cubic metres (2\u00a0billion cubic feet) per day.\n\nThe -long MEGAL S\u00fcd pipeline between Oberkappel and Schwandorf is operated at a pressure of 67.5\u00a0bar (979 psi), which is secured by two compressor stations. The connecting pipeline between MEGAL Nord and MEGAL S\u00fcd is  long and it is connected in Rothenstadt and Schwandorf.\n\nThe MEGAL pipeline crosses the Trans Europa Naturgas Pipeline and the Remich pipeline at Mittelbrunn, the METG (pipeline from the German-Dutch border) at Gernsheim, and the pipeline going to the Ruhr Industrial Area at Rimpar.\n\nOwnership\nThe pipeline is owned by Open Grid Europe (51%) and GRTgaz Deutschland (subsidiary of GRTgaz \u2013 49%).

Soap Co.\"\n\nSynopsis\nThe album consists of two 28-minute pieces, each taking up one side of the original vinyl release.\n\n\"How Can You Be in Two Places at Once When You're Not Anywhere at All\" \nThis opens with a late-night TV commercial by car salesman Ralph Spoilsport (Philip Proctor), a spoof of Southern California Ford dealer Ralph Williams. As he extols the virtues of a featured new car, the main character Babe (Peter Bergman), runs across traffic onto the lot and interrupts Ralph's spiel with an immediate desire to buy the car in question. Ralph enthusiastically invites Babe to take a look inside his \"beautiful new home\". The impossibly luxurious car contains a \"home entertainment system\", with AM and FM radio and television. Spoilsport turns on each component in turn, creating a cacophonous din.\n\nBabe buys the car and, as he drives it, the text of road signs and billboards along the road is spoken as he passes them. He decides to take the Antelope Freeway, and the distance signs to it progress per Zeno's paradox (one mile, 1/2 mile, 1/4 mile, etc.) The infinite series is broken only when he decides to try the \"all-weather climate control\", and selects \"tropical paradise\" from a list of options. At the push of a button, this transforms the interior of his car into a tropical rainforest, complete with sounds of exotic birds, thunder, and rainfall.\n\nA troupe of wise-cracking explorers emerge from the trees, including someone who sounds like W. C. Fields, on a half-hearted expedition. Babe tries to escape the interlopers by changing the climate control to \"Land of the Pharaohs\" and is transported to ancient Egypt, but to no avail; the explorers have come with him. Increasingly annoyed, he complains that the sun is setting and it will be night soon. They reply he's confused, the horizon is moving up; so they stand him on his head to convince him that it is morning. Babe loses his balance and falls to the ground, causing one to remark, \"He's no fun! He fell right over!\". A loud rumbling is heard, and the group realizes that a pyramid is opening.\n\nThe pyramid is actually a motel, with a vacancy. Babe enters the lobby and encounters a pair of partiers. They  gradually morph into panoply of characters who launch a satirical celebration of America which parodies Norman Corwin's 1941 patriotic radio pageant We Hold These Truths. This includes sardonic references to slavery and the conquest of the American Indians. At one point, each member of the group rhythmically repeats the names of the candidates in the 1968 presidential election mimicking a steam locomotive: \"Rockefeller, Nixon, Humphrey, and Kennedy.\"\n\nEventually, Babe is drafted into the army, and the play morphs again into the closing scene of a World War II musical film \"Babes In Khaki\", starring Lillie Lamont (Proctor). The movie is broadcast on  television, and after it ends, channel surfing reveals snippets of random commercials and program segments. At one point we hear a crime drama, with tough guys saying they hate cops. One named Nick declares he's \"gonna get even with every rotten cop in this city\", by turning in his badge and burning his uniform.\n\nFinally, Spoilsport returns as \"Ralph Icebag\", selling marijuana instead of cars. His spiel morphs into a close paraphrase of Molly Bloom's Soliloquy which closes James Joyce's novel Ulysses.\n\n\"The Further Adventures of Nick Danger\" \nThis is presented as an episode (titled \"Cut 'Em Off at the Past\") of a fictional 1940s radio drama, Nick Danger, Third Eye, broadcast on December 7, 1941. Nick Danger (Phil Austin) is a '40s-style hardboiled private investigator in the Raymond Chandler mold. In live performances and photographs, he wears the stereotypical fedora and trench coat. He has the obligatory nemesis on the police force, Lieutenant Bradshaw (Bergman), who questions Danger's every move. His \"mark\" is Rocky Rococo (Proctor), a Peter Lorre parody. True to the clich\u00e9s of the genre, there is a suspicious butler, Catherwood (David Ossman), and a femme fatale: Danger's old college flame Betty Jo Bialosky (Proctor, or Bergman in scenes with Rocky Rococo), with aliases Melanie Haber, Audrey Farber, and Susan Underhill, whom \"everyone knew as Nancy\" (parodying a line from the Beatles' song \"Rocky Raccoon\").\n\nThis sketch is not as surreal or Kafkaesque as most other Firesign Theatre material, though it is intermixed and loaded with references to the Beatles, the I Ching, and other counterculture topics.  The basic plot involves the attempt by Rococo to sell Danger a stolen ring, that belonged to Nancy; Danger is thus drawn into a trap and framed when Nancy and Catherwood kill Rococo because he found out about time travel experiments by Catherwood, leading Danger to a violent confrontation with all of them and forcing a confession from Catherwood at gunpoint.  It also parodies characteristics of old-time radio drama production, e.g. referring to a fireplace fire as \"the cellophane\" and \"coming in out of the cornstarch\" (used to create the sound effects); actors reading the wrong lines, or dropping their scripts; actors stepping out of character to read commercials; and referring to the use of voice fade-outs and organ cues to signal transitions between flashbacks.\n\nAt one point, Nancy faints and falls over, causing Danger to say, \"She's no fun, she fell right over.\" He remembers he (Austin) said this same line on side 1 of the record, and asks, \"Where am I? I'd better check.\" The side 1 track is then heard playing backwards, and Danger says, \"It's OK, they're speaking Chinese\" and continues with the play.\n\nThe climax is reached as Catherwood's return from a flashback is bungled, resulting in the duplication of every character except Lieutenant Bradshaw. Just as Danger is about to try something daring to solve this problem and extricate himself from his trap, the action is abruptly interrupted by a special news bulletin, in which President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Bergman) wearily tells the American people of the attack on Pearl Harbor. He declares our \"rendezvous with destiny\" demands the United States \"unconditionally surrender\" to the Empire of Japan. The bulletin ends, but it is too late to find out what Danger did; Bradshaw is congratulating him for solving the case.\n\nThe closing organ theme chord segues into Austin laughing and singing \"ta-da!\", and the Firesign Theatre talk to the producer, announcing their intent to \"go back to the other side of the record\". The producer then announces, \"Scene 3, take 600\".\n\nIssues and reissues\nThis album was originally released on both LP and 8-track tape, and was later released on cassette.\n\nLP \u2013 Columbia CS-9884\n8 Track \u2013 Columbia 18C-09884\nCassette \u2013 PCT-09884\n\nIt has been reissued on CD at least 5 times:\n\nIn 1988 by Mobile Fidelity \u2013 MFCD-834\nIn 1995 by Sony/Legacy \u2013 CK-9884\nIn 2001 by Sony/Legacy \u2013 CK-85774, purchasable from Laugh.com \u2013 Order #LGH1070\n\nArtwork\nThe front cover of the album features photographs of Groucho Marx and John Lennon framed by faux Cyrillic lettering, \"\u0414LL \u041d\u0414\u0406L \u041c\u0414\u042f\u0416 L\u0404\u0418\u0418\u0424\u0418\".

It has a spherical fruit,  in diameter. The Key lime is usually picked while it is still green, but it becomes yellow when ripe.\n\nThe Key lime has thinner rind and is smaller, seedier, more acidic and more aromatic than the Persian lime (Citrus \u00d7 latifolia). It is valued for its characteristic flavor. The name comes from its association with the Florida Keys, where it is best known as the flavoring ingredient in Key lime pie. It is also known as West Indian lime, bartender's lime, Omani lime, or Mexican lime, the last classified as a distinct race with a thicker skin and darker green colour. Philippine varieties have various names, including dayap and bilolo.\n\nEtymology \nThe English word lime was derived, via Spanish then French, from the Arabic word  l\u012bma, which is, in turn, a derivation of the Persian word limu . Key is from Florida Keys, where the fruit was naturalised. The earliest known use of the name is from 1905, where the fruit was described as \"the finest on the market. It is aromatic, juicy, and highly superior to the lemon.\"\n\nDescription \n\nC. aurantiifolia is a shrubby tree, to , with many thorns. Dwarf varieties exist that can be grown indoors during winter months and in colder climates. Its trunk, which rarely grows straight, has many branches, and they often originate quite far down on the trunk. The leaves are ovate,  long, resembling orange leaves (the scientific name aurantiifolia refers to this resemblance to the leaves of the orange, Citrus aurantium). The flowers are  in diameter, are yellowish white with a light purple tinge on the margins. Flowers and fruit appear throughout the year, but are most abundant from May to September in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\nSkin contact can sometimes cause phytophotodermatitis, which makes the skin especially sensitive to ultraviolet light.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Key lime cultivar is a citrus hybrid, Citrus micrantha \u00d7 Citrus medica (a papeda-citron cross).\n\nCitrus aurantiifolia is native to Southeast Asia. Its apparent path of introduction was through the Middle East to North Africa, then to Sicily and Andalucia and then, via Spanish explorers, to the West Indies, including the Florida Keys. Henry Perrine is credited with introducing the Key lime to Florida. From the Caribbean, lime cultivation spread to tropical and subtropical North America, including Mexico, Florida, and later California.\n\nIn California in the late 19th century, \"Mexican\" limes were more highly valued than lemons; however, in Florida, they were generally considered weeds. Then, in 1894\u201395, the Great Freeze destroyed the Florida lemon groves, and farmers replanted Mexican limes instead; they soon became known as the Florida Key Lime, a \"beloved regional crop\". But when the 1926 Miami hurricane ripped them up, they were replanted with the hardier, thornless Persian limes.\n\nSince the North American Free Trade Agreement came into effect, most Key limes on the United States market have been grown in Mexico, Central America and South America. They are also grown in Texas, Florida, and California.\n\nThe Key lime has given rise to several other lime varieties.  The best known, the triploid progeny of a Key lime-lemon cross, is the Persian lime (Citrus \u00d7 latifolia), the most widely produced lime, globally. Others are, like their parent, classed within C. aurantiifolia. Backcrossing with citron has produced a distinct group of triploid limes that are also of commercial value to a limited degree, the seedy Tanepeo, Coppenrath, Ambilobe and Mohtasseb lime varieties as well as the Madagascar lemon. Hybridization with a mandarin-pomelo cross similar to the oranges has produced the Kirk lime. The New Caledonia and Kaghzi limes appear to have resulted from an F2 Key lime self-pollination, while a spontaneous genomic duplication gave us the tetraploid Giant Key lime. The potential to produce a wider variety of lime hybrids from the Key lime due to its tendency to form diploid gametes may reduce the disease risk presented by the limited diversity of the current commercial limes.\n\nAgronomy\n\nCultivation and propagation \n\nThere are various approaches to the cultivation of Key limes. This variety of citrus can be propagated from seed and will grow true to the parent. The seeds must be kept moist until they can be planted, as they will not germinate if allowed to dry out.  If the plants are propagated from seed, the seeds should be stored at least 5\u20136 months before planting. Alternatively, vegetative propagation from cuttings or by air layering may permit fruit production within one year, and from genetically more predictable lines of plants. Another method, digging around a mature tree to sever roots, will encourage new sprouts that can be transplanted to another location.  Clones are often bud grafted into rough lemon or sour orange to obtain strong root stocks (see also fruit tree propagation).\n\nIt is often advisable to graft the plants onto rootstocks with low susceptibility to gummosis because seedlings generally are highly vulnerable to the disease. Useful rootstocks include wild grapefruit, cleopatra mandarin and tahiti limes. C. macrophylla is also sometimes used as a rootstock in Florida to add vigor.\n\nClimatic conditions and fruit maturation are crucial in cultivation of the lime tree. Under consistently warm conditions potted trees can be planted at any season, whereas in cooler temperate regions it is best to wait for the late winter or early spring. The Key lime tree does best in sunny sites, well-drained soils, good air circulation, and protection from cold wind. Because its root system is shallow, the Key lime is planted in trenches or into prepared and broken rocky soil to give the roots a better anchorage and improve the trees' wind resistance. Pruning and topping should be planned to maximise the circulation of air and provide plenty of sunlight. This keeps the crown healthily dry, improves accessibility for harvesting, and discourages the organisms that cause gummosis.\n\nHarvesting \n \n\nThe method of cultivation greatly affects the size and quality of the harvest. Trees cultivated from seedlings take 4\u20138 years before producing a harvest. They attain their maximal yield at about 10 years of age. Trees produced from cuttings and air layering bear fruit much sooner, sometimes producing fruit (though not a serious harvest) a year after planting. It takes approximately 9 months from the blossom to the fruit. When the fruit have grown to harvesting size and begin to turn yellow they are picked and not clipped. To achieve produce of the highest market value, it is important not to pick the fruit too early in the morning; the turgor is high then, and handling turgid fruit releases the peel oils and may cause spoilage.\n\nPostharvest process \n\nShelf life of Key limes is an important consideration in marketing. The lime still ripens for a considerable time after harvesting, and it is usually stored between  at a relative humidity of 75\u201385%. Special procedures are employed to control the shelf life; for example, applications of growth regulators, fruit wax, fungicides, precise cooling, calcium compounds, silver nitrate, and special packing material. The preferred storage conditions are temperatures of  and a humidity over 85%, but even in ideal conditions post-harvesting losses are high.\n\nIn India most Key lime producers are small-scale farmers without access to such post-harvesting facilities, but makeshift expedients can be of value. One successful procedure is a coating of coconut oil that improves shelf life, thereby achieving a constant market supply of Key limes.\n\nKey limes are made into black lime by boiling them in brine and drying them. Black lime is a condiment commonly used in the Middle East.\n\nYield \nThe yield varies depending on the age of the trees. Five- to seven-year-old orchards may yield about 6\u00a0t/ha (2.7 tons/acre), with harvests increasing progressively until they stabilise at about 12\u201318\u00a0t/ha (5.4\u20138 tons/acre).

A different, smaller, lower wing improved its performance for daytime flights. One was built and used by the United States Post Office Department.\n\nDesign and development\n\nThe Mercury Senior was a single bay biplane without stagger and with dihedral only on the lower wing. Both wings were rectangular in plan out to blunted tips and had constant, thick sections; they were built around twin spruce and plywood spars and fabric covered.  The upper wing was held over the fuselage by a pair of N-form cabane struts. The interplane struts were in parallel pairs, assisted by the usual wire cross-bracing.  There were externally interconnected ailerons on both upper and lower wings.\n\nThe novel feature of the Senior was the choice of lower wing: two were available, one with a shorter span than the upper wing and one with a longer span. The latter increased the total wing area by about 27% and decreased the wing loading by 19%. Lower wing loadings decrease aircraft speeds, so the longer span set provided lower night landing speeds at the price of reduced cruising speed.\n\nThe fuselage of the Senior was a welded steel tube frame, its forward part covered with light metal and the rear with plywood. Externally it was flat-sided with rounded upper decking. A  Liberty L-12 water-cooled V12 engine in the nose drove a two-bladed, steel Curtiss propeller. Its honeycomb radiator was ahead of the engine, which had long exhaust pipes on both sides of the fuselage to take the emissions past the pilot. His open cockpit was well behind the trailing edge of the wing. Up to  of mail was stored in the space between engine and cockpit.\n\nThe rear surfaces of the Senior were large, with a rectangular, strut-braced tailplane mounted on top of the fuselage carrying elevators hinged at the end of it. Its wire-braced, tall, broad, rounded fin had a straight-edged unbalanced rudder which, like the elevators, overhung the extreme tail.\n\nThe Senior's landing gear was fixed and conventional with wheels, well apart, on a single axle held on two V-struts; the forward struts of the Vs contained shock absorbers. An angled, flexible tailskid, with another small shock absorber between its ends, projected beyond the extreme tail.  For night landings a pair of searchlights in streamlined housings were attached below the lower wings, under the feet of the interplane struts.\n\nOperational history\nThe sole Senior flew for the first time in 1925 and was used by the Post Office until 1928.\n\nOperators\n\n United States Post Office Department\n\nSpecifications (night flight configuration)\n\nReferences\n\n1920s United States mailplanes\nBiplanes\nSingle-engined tractor aircraft\nAircraft first flown in 1925", "The 2012\u201313 Pro12 League (also known as the RaboDirect Pro12 for sponsorship reasons) was the 12th season of the rugby union competition originally known as the Celtic League, the third with its current 12-team format, and the second with RaboDirect as title sponsor.\n\nOspreys were the defending champions, but they failed to qualify for the end-of-season playoffs.\n\nThe twelve teams that competed were the four Irish teams, Munster, Leinster, Connacht and Ulster; two Scottish teams, Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors; four Welsh teams, Cardiff Blues, Newport Gwent Dragons, Ospreys and Scarlets; and two Italian teams, Benetton Treviso and newly created Zebre.\n\nThe title was won by Leinster, defeating Ulster 24\u201318 in the final.\n\nChanges for the season\n\nItaly\nZebre replaced Aironi Rugby after they had their licence revoked by the Italian Rugby Federation for financial reasons.

Founded by the Sri Lankan Buddhist leader Anagarika Dharmapala and the British journalist and poet Sir Edwin Arnold, its first office was in Bodh Gaya. The organization's efforts began in order to resuscitate Buddhism in India, and to restore the ancient Buddhist shrines at Bodh Gaya, Sarnath and Kushinara. The restoration and revival of the glory and sanctity of Bodh Gaya are also aims of Maha Bodhi Society.\n\nAlthough many Indians had remained culturally Buddhist for centuries after the decline of Buddhism, they did not self-identify as \"Buddhist\".  The Maha Bodhi Society renewed interest in Buddhism, and spawned the Ladakh Buddhist Association, All Assam Buddhist Association, and Himalayan Buddhist Society, as well as laying the grounds for the Dalit Buddhist movement.\n\nOrigins\nIn 1891, while on pilgrimage to the recently restored Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the location where Siddhartha Gautama (the Buddha) attained enlightenment, Anagarika Dharmapala had experienced a shock to find the temple in the hands of a Saivite priest, the Buddha image transformed into a Hindu icon and Buddhists barred from worship. As a result, he began an agitation movement. Prior to that, in 1885 Sir Edwin Arnold visited the site and published several articles drawing the attention of the Buddhists to the deplorable conditions of Bodh Gaya. The Buddhist renaissance inaugurated by Anagarika Dharmapala through his Mahabodhi Movement has also been described as \"conservative\" for it considered Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent responsible for the decay of Buddhism in India, in the then current mood of Hindu-Buddhist brotherhood.\n\nThe Mahabodhi Society at Colombo was founded in 1891 but its offices were moved to Calcutta the following year. One of its primary aims was the restoration of the Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the chief of the four ancient Holy sites to Buddhist control. To accomplish this Dharmapala initiated a lawsuit against the Brahmin priests who had held control of the site for centuries. After a protracted struggle this was successful with the partial restoration of the site to the management of the Maha Bodhi Society in 1949.\n\nMaha Bodhi Society branches have been established in several countries, most significantly in India and Sri Lanka. A United States branch was founded by Dr. Paul Carus in Chicago. There is also a Maha Bodhi Society of Bangalore, founded by Acharya Buddharakkhita in 1956, which is not a part of or tied to the Maha Bodhi Society of India or Sri Lanka.\n\nThe Mahabodhi Temple\n\nAfter the defeat of the Palas by the Hindu Sena dynasty, Buddhism's position again began to erode and was soon followed by the conquest of Magadha by General Ikhtiar Uddin Muhammad Bin Bakhtiyar Khilji. During this period, the Mahabodhi Temple fell into disrepair and was largely abandoned. During the 16th century, a Hindu monastery was established near Bodh Gaya. Over the following centuries, the monastery's abbot or mahant became the area's primary landholder and claimed ownership of the Mahabodhi Temple grounds.\n\nIn the 1880s, the then-British government of India began to restore Mahabodhi Temple under the direction of Sir Alexander Cunningham. In 1885, Sir Edwin Arnold visited the site and published several articles drawing the attention of the Buddhists to the deplorable conditions of Buddhagaya. He was guided in this undertaking by Ven. Weligama Sri Sumangala. In 1891, Anagarika Dharmapala started a campaign to return control of the temple to Buddhists, over the objections of the mahant. The campaign was partially successful in 1949, when control passed from the Hindu mahant to the state government of Bihar, which established a temple management committee. The committee has nine members, a majority of whom, including the chairman, must by law be Hindus. Mahabodhi's first head monk under the management committee was Anagarika Munindra, a Bengali man who had been an active member of the Maha Bodhi Society.\n\nMulagandha Kuty Vihara in Sarnath\n\nMulagandha Kuty Vihara in Sarnath is a fitting reminder of Sarnath's past glory. It is also the crowning and most glorious achievement of Anagarika Dharmapala's lifelong dedication.\nThe construction of the Mulagandha Kuty Vihara was taken up by Anagarika Dharmapala in 1926, towards the end of his pious life. When he decided to construct a temple at Sarnath and after making the architectural plans, it was the generous Hawaiian Lady, Mary Foster who gave the first financial assistance that came from her parents, brother and well-wishers. Anagarika Dharmapala personally supervised the constructional works. The 200 feet high magnificent temple was opened to public in 1931. Later a reputed Japanese artist Kosetsu Nosu (1885- 1973) and his assistant undertook the task to decorate the temple walls with fresco paintings famously as the Mural paintings of Mulagandha Kuty Vihara, depicting the life events of Sakyamuni Buddha. On the opening day of the Vihara, the Buddha's relics donated to Anagarika Dharmapala by Govt. of India under the British Raj was enshrined in the temple. The Vihara, an attractive place of Buddhist worship was visited by numerous Indian and foreign dignitaries and millions of pilgrims and tourists over the past decades.  At the Mulagandha Kuty Vihara annual function in November, the most attractive item among the programs is the exposition of the Buddha's sacred relic. People from different countries and from the homeland visit the Vihara to homage to the sacred relic considering it as a rare and an opportune moment in their lifetime.\n\nPublications \nThe Maha Bodhi Society has a robust tradition of publications, spanning from Pali translations into modern Indian vernacular languages (such as Hindi) to scholarly texts and new editions of Pali works typeset in Devanagari to appeal to a Hindi-educated Indian audience. They have also published books and pamphlets in local/regional languages and dialects, sometimes in partnership with other presses.\n\nLeadership\n\nMost Venerable P Seewalee Thero is serving as the 12th and current General Secretary of the Maha Bodhi Society of India since 2016 and the Joint Secretaries are Venerable Kahatagollawe Medhankara Thero and Ven. Rathmalwa Sumithananda Thero.\n\nAt a meeting in September 2008, the Maha Bodhi Society passed a rule that only persons born into Buddhist families will be eligible to serve as president or as one of the vice-presidents of the Society. The outgoing president, B. K. Modi, a Hindu, assumed the position of patron. At the same meeting, the 14th Dalai Lama was given the new title of chief patron.\n\nSee also\n Acharya Buddharakkhita\n Anagarika Munindra\n Hammalawa Saddhatissa\n London Buddhist Vihara\n Sri Lanka Maha Bodhi Centre, Chennai\n Buddhism in India\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Mahabodhi Society\n Mahabodhi Society, Bangalore\n\nBuddhism in India\nBuddhist organisations based in India\nReligious organizations established in 1891\n1891 establishments in Ceylon", "End in Tears (2005) is a novel by English crime writer Ruth Rendell, the twentieth in her acclaimed Inspector Wexford series.\n\nSynopsis\nWhen a lump of concrete is thrown from a bridge and into passing traffic one dark night, the wrong motorist dies.

During his stay at the University of Bern, he spent three years studying philosophy, then theology.\n\nIn 1816, according to the Swiss custom of ordination, he was accepted as a candidate for church duties, after which he studied theology in T\u00fcbingen for another year, and from 1817 to 1818 studied the history in G\u00f6ttingen. Upon his return, he was appointed vicar in Unterseen, but in the fall of 1818 he resigned his post and, wishing to fill his knowledge of the Eastern languages, went to Paris, where he studied Arabic, Persian and Sanskrit languages under Sylvestre de Sacy.\n\nAfter spending some time in Great Britain, Henzi returned to his homeland in the summer of 1819, wishing to devote himself to academic activity. At this time, the Department of Exegesis and Oriental Languages was inaugurated at the University of Tartu, where he was elected to the University Council, and on 5 March 1820, he was appointed Ordinary Professor. Even before his departure, Henzi received a degree as a Doctor of Theology at University of T\u00fcbingen for processing part of the still unreleased Arabic commentary of Al-Baydawi on the Quran.\n\nOn 30 August 1820, he delivered an introductory lecture: \"\u00dcber Verh\u00e4ltniss der Schriften des Alten und Neuen Testaments zu einander nach Inhalt und Form\". In addition to lectures on Exegesis, he also gave lectures on Eastern languages, led practical exercises on Exegesis in the theological seminary, and during the 1822\u20131823 academic year Henzi temporarily supervised practical classes \"on the Gospel pericopam\".\n\nIn 1821, he became director of the Tartu Branch of the Russian Bible Society, and in 1822, a member of the school commission. He was elected dean of the theological faculty four times.\n\nHenzi died on 1 February 1829 in Tartu.\n\nFor the funeral, Gottlieb Eduard Lenz wrote an Oratio Funebris in German and Latin, which is held at the National Library of Estonia.\n\nFamily \n\nHenzi was the son of a very rich commerciant, Rudolph Jakob Henzi, of Bern.\n\nHenzi married Margaretha Adriana Rosamunde Furer on 31 July 1821 in Tartu. Their son, Samuel Rudolf Henzi, was born on 8 December 1822 in Tartu (or 26 November 1822 in Bern), and studied Medicine in St. Petersburg, Tartu and Bern.\n\nHenzi was buried on 4 February 1829 in Tartu Vana-Jaani cemetery in plot XXXIII, field 1527, grave 5. The gravestone has since gotten removed, presumably by the Soviets, who did not like this \"German graveyard\", and cleared the whole plot XXXIII.\n\nSelected bibliography\n\nBooks\n D. R.

The organization is part of the Islamic reformist Mujahid Movement and follows the principles of Salafism. The Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen was formed as a result of renaissance activities among Keralite Muslims led by  scholars and clerics such as Sheikh Hamadani Thangal, K.M. Moulavi and Vakkom Moulavi and E. Moidu Moulavi and Ummer Moulavi. Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen is considered as the successor of Kerala Muslim Aikya Sangam, the first Muslim organization in the state of Kerala, founded in 1924. The Mujahid movement laid the foundations of Islamic renaissance in Kerala by campaigning against corrupted practices of the Sufi orders, superstitions, false beliefs, polytheism etc, and called for the revival of true Islamic practices to the Muslim community in Kerala which had until then been severely lacking in crucial aspects of religious and socio-civic knowledge. The Mujahids consider themselves as proponents of authentic Islamic reform, pursuing a purified concept of Tawhid.\n\nThe social, cultural, educational, and religious activities of Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen enhanced the Islamic renaissance, and enabled the state's Muslims to create their own characteristics and peculiarities that distinguished them from other Muslim communities in India by achieving high rates of literacy and a prestigious status in Kerala society. The Mujahid movement continues the Islamic reform traditions of the scholars Taqi al-Din ibn Taymiyya (1263-1328 C.E/661-728 A.H), Ahmad Sirhindi (1564-1624 C.E/ 971-1034 A.H), Shah Waliullah ad-Dehlawi (1703-1762 C.E/  1114-1176 A.H), Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1792 C.E/ 1115-1207 A.H) and Muhammad Rashid Rida (1865-1935 C.E/ 1281 A.H-1353 A.H).\n\nThe theological reformation initiated by Vakkom Abdul Qadir Moulavi and his disciples was a conservative reform movement directly influenced by the Arab Salafiyya scholarly circles and trends popular in Syria, Egypt, etc. Although the Mujahids often visited the Wahhabi scholars of Saudi Arabia, the movement differed from both the militant Puritanism of the Arabian Wahhabi reformation as well as the \"Neo-Mu'tazilism\" of the culture-oriented North Indian Muslim modernists like Sir Sayyid Ahmad Khan. Instead, it was closer in spirit to the Arab Salafiyya movement, advancing a Keralite adaptation of reformist doctrines that focused on awakening Pan-Islamic consciousness; which became a major reason for its popularity.\n\nHistory \nThe consensus among historians is that Islam arrived in Kerala through Arab traders either during the time of Muhammed himself (AD 609 - AD 632) or in the following few decades. Kerala has an ancient relation with the Middle East even during the Pre-Islamic period. Muslim merchants (Malik, son of Dinar) settled in Kerala by the 8th century AD and introduced Islam. For a long time they kept the Islamic beliefs based on the message of Quran and the teachings of Muhammed. Later the Muslim community divided into different groups because of religious and political reasons. By the 16th century AD, with the arrival of colonization led by the Postugese and the colonial modernity they gradually declined to a culturally, economically, and educationally deprived condition.\n\nKerala Muslim Aikhya Sangam \n\nThe history of Kerala Mappila renaissance began in the 19th century AD with Sayyid Sanaulla Makti Thangal. He encouraged Muslims to settle their differences by returning to the message of the Quran and the teachings of Muhammed. Sayyid Sanaulla Makti Thangal died in 1912, but he inspired scholars such as Sheikh Hamadani Thangal, K.M. Moulavi and Vakkom Moulavi. Apart from Sayy\u012bd S\u0101n\u0101ullah, the works of other scholars such as Chalilakath Kunjahamed Hajji (d. 1920), Shaikh Muhammad Ham\u0101d\u0101ni Th\u0103ng\u00e2l (d. 1922) provided the impetus for theological reformation amongst the Mappila Muslim Ulema. They formed the first Muslim movement in Kerala, known as the Kerala Muslim Aikhya Sangam, in Kodungallur in 1922, founded by the freedom fighter and Islamic scholar Vakkom 'Abdul Qadir Moulavi (d. 1873 - 1932 C.E). Beginning his career as an orthodox Maulavi, 'Abdul Qadir would become most influential social, theological and educational reformer of the Mujahids.\n\nWith the help of a Malabar Mappilas, Vakkom Moulavi was introduced to the popular Pan-Islamic journal Al-Manar, published by the influential Salafi scholar M\u00f9h\u0101mm\u00e1d R\u00e1sh\u012bd R\u00eed\u00e2 (1865 - 1935 C.E) from Cairo. Vakkom Moulavi would be its ardent reader, and through Al-Manar, Moulavi became familiar with a wide range of contemporary Islamic reform movements and would be influenced by the doctrines of the 14th century Sunni theologian Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328 C.E / 728 A.H). Impressed by these reformers' staunch commitment to Tawhid, Moulavi began vigorously campaigning against shirk and bid'ah (innovations); and proclaimed the centrality of upholding Tawhid. Advocating the teachings of Rashid Rida and Ibn Taymiyya, Vakkom Moulavi attacked Madhab partisanship, condemned Taqlid, calling upon Muslims to shun un-Islamic customs by directly returning to Qur'an and Hadith; and establish Islamic Unity. Modelled after Al-Manar, Moulavi would publish numerous journals and magazines with the purpose of spreading Islamic message, in a way that would directly reach the common masses, through three languages Malayalam, Arabic and Arabi-Malayalam. Proclaiming the reformers' gratitude to Rashid Rida, Vakkom Moulavi wrote:\"It is through Rashid Rida's Al-Manar that Kerala Muslims were awakened\"Vakkom Moulavi's teachings would be popularised across Malabar by his disciples like Khatib Muhammad Moulavi (1886 - 1964 C.E). Like his teacher, K.M Moulavi was a regular reader of Al-Manar journal and a well-read expert of Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence) and Islamic theology. K.M Moulavi was a fierce opponent of the British administration and played a major role in the Mappila rebellion of 1921, which sought to topple British colonial rule in Malabar. After the uprising was put down, K.M Moulavi fled to Kodungalur, a Muslim region free from British influences. From Kondungalur, Moulavi became known as a reputed scholar and advocated reformist campaigns calling for the eradication of shirk and bid'ah. He was also a founding leader of Kerala Muslim Aikya Sangham in 1921. K.M Moulavi played an important role in the proliferation of various Islamic publications like Al-Irshad, Al-Islah, Al-Murshid, etc and was a regular contributor in Rashid Rida's Al-Manar. At popular request, the British authorities would withdraw all Mappila Rebellion charges in 1932 and the Moulavi would return home. In 1932, K.M Moulavi held a meeting of major Moulavis from all parts of Kerala and announced the establishment of \"Kerala Jam'iyyat al-Ulema\". Thereafter, Moulavi would become the most influential Islamic scholar of the Mappila Muslims of Malabar. His fatwas were widely requested all across Kerala due to his immense knowledge of Qur'an and Hadith; as well as his juristic mastery of Shafi'i and Hanafi madh'habs (legal schools). By force of his charismatic personality and widely accepted scholarly credentials, Moulavi was able to overcome newly developed opposition to the Islahi movement.\n\nThe movement encouraged Muslims to settle their differences by returning to the message of the Quran and the teachings of Muhammed. This message attracted educated people, and the group slowly gained the confidence of the Muslims of Kerala. The efforts of Aikhya Sangam promoted the formation of several formal and informal associations in other areas of Kerala. The Muslim Nishpaksha Sangam and Islam Dharma Sangam were important among them. The common goal of all these organizations was to promote the unity of Muslims based on the message of Quran and the teachings of Muhammed. The annual meetings of Kerala Muslim Aikhya Sangam gained attention by the participation of international Islamic scholars such as Marmaduke Pickthall.\n\nKerala Jamiyyathul Ulama \nMany Muslim scholars in different areas of Kerala attracted by the message of \"Kerala Muslim Aikhya Sangam\" but they could not interact due to the lack of a common forum. Therefore, the leaders of \"Kerala Muslim Aikhya Sangam\" decided to create a forum of Muslim scholars for discussing religious matters. It resulted in the formation of the First Forum of Muslim Scholars Of Kerala at the Annual General Meeting of Kerala Muslim Aikhya Sangam in 1924 at Aluva. This scholars' forum is referred to as \"Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama Ahlussunna wal Jamaath\", also known as Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama (KJU). It acted as the advisory body of the Aikhya Sangam until the latter dissolved in 1934, but is still an active body in providing religious leadership to Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen.\n\nFormation of Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen \n\nThe KJU decided to propagate the Islamic ideologies with the participation of people of all intellectual levels under its guidance. So, on 12 April 1947, in a working committee meeting of KJU, they decided to form a public organization. Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen officially formed on 20 April 1950 in a meeting held at the office off \"Al Manar\" Magazine at Calicut. The organization registered in 1957 under the Society Act.\n\nKNM had been split into two groups from 2002. Both the groups completed discussions at all levels in their respective feeder organizations and a joint sitting was held on 20 December. This division in KNM happened in 2002 when a faction led by Hussain Madavoor split from the parent organization over a number of ideological and organizational issues. In 2012, another organization came into existence from the KNM on the issues related to genie and sorcery, known as Wisdom Global Islamic Mission. The two major groups decided to merge into one platform in 2016. This was announced on 20 December 2016 in front of a huge audience at Calicut. However, soon after in 2018, another split occurred on the same ideological and organizational issues and currently they both are known as KNM (Official) and KNM (Markazudda'wa) respectively.\n\nOrganization \nKNM have a number of feeder organizations under the religious leadership of Kerala Jamiyyathul Ulama (KJU) to achieve its objectives at all levels of society.\n\nIthihadu Shubbanil Mujahideen \nThe youth wing is referred to as Ithihadu Shubbanil Mujahideen (ISM). It was organized in 1967, and its main objective is to teach youth about the messages of the Quran and of Muhammed. Since its formation, it conducts youth oriented campaigns, seminars and symposiums on social issues. In December 2006 ISM conducted an international exhibition on Islam named \"Salvation\" at Calicut, which gained international attention and helped clear misconceptions about Islam. Its second and third editions were conducted at Eranakulam and Dubai.\n\nMujahid Students Movement \nThe student wing is known as Mujahid Students Movement (MSM). It was formed in 1971 to organize all Muslim students under the renaissance activities and to promote quality education and Islamic values.\nMSM conducts annual meetings for students of various fields of study, such as:\n\n Profcon: The largest gathering of professional students in India. Students from hundreds of professional colleges and universities participate in these 3-day moral classes. The first edition was held at JDT Islam Campus, Calicut in 1995 and the last edition was held at Kodungallur in 2018 November.\n NASCO: National Arabic Students Conference\n Signs: Arts and Science students.\n ILLUMINA: Exclusive conference of medical students\n\nMuslim Girls & Women's Movement \nThe female wing is known as Muslim Girls & Women's Movement (MGM), which was formed in 1988. The organization's main objectives are to promote women's education and spread awareness about women's rights in Islam. MGM conducts study classes and conferences exclusively for women.\n\nBesides its feeder organizations, KNM has formed a number of specialized forums to attend to the particular needs of the society. They include:\n\n Integrated Medical Brotherhood (IMB), medical wing of KNM\n BISMI:\n ECGC: Education and Career Guidance Centre. \n Education Board \n Zakath Cells: Centralized collection and distribution of Zakat\n Hilal Committee \n KNM Publishing Wing\n Gulf Islahi Centre (GIC)\n\nConferences \n\nKerala Nadvathul Mujahideen is noted for its annual conferences held during the initial stages of its formation. Great public attention began to be drawn when it decided to hold quinquennial conferences. The enthusiasm with which people have responded to the call of Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen has been highly encouraging. After every conference the fame and name of Kerala Nadvathul Mujahideen spread far and wide. Many people have participated in these conferences. The flow of people, not only from Kerala, but from other areas of India and from foreign countries, made the conference into a large event.

It is located  north west of Swanley,  south east of Bexleyheath and  south west of Dartford. It is one of over 1,000 woodlands in the United Kingdom looked after by the Woodland Trust. The first records of a wood on this site go back to the year 1600. It is also the name of a housing estate to the east of the woodland itself.\n\nWildlife\nThere are nine ponds in the wood, each of which is a habitat for the three British newt species, the great crested newt, the smooth newt and the palmate newt.\n\nBritish birds of prey have been noted in the area including buzzards, sparrowhawks, and kestrels.\n\nIn spring, various flowers grow on the woodland floor such as bluebells, sunny yellow celandines and lily of the valley. Autumn sees a range of fungi grow from deadwood and the floor. Amethyst deceiver and lilac bonnet, and the fly agaric. In the winter months, conifer trees grow in abundance.\n\nArchaeology\nThere are traces of settlements in the forest that are over 2,000 years old, and deneholes have been found. Faesten Dic, \u2018the strong dike\u2019, is a boundary feature built around 1,500 years ago by Saxon settlers; it runs for over a kilometre through the forest.\n\nArchaeological investigation during the 1950s has also revealed that a medieval hall flanked by two smaller buildings was present in the area, now underneath an area of housing that is east of Summerhouse Drive and south of Joyden's Wood Road. The hall was likely constructed out of timber with a tiled roof, and the period of occupation has been dated to between circa 1280 and 1320 through an analysis of the pottery found at the site. This reflects the likelihood that the site was inhabited for about two generations, but no longer. It is possible that this building was the Manor of Ocholt, which is known from historical records to have been located nearby and which was owned by Lesnes Abbey. Some of the pottery sherds found were identified as belonging to grey ware produced in the Limpsfield area of Surrey; such Limpsfield ware was supplied to London and northern Kent, having also been found at nearby sites Cray House and Eynsford Castle.\n\nThe likely source of fresh water for the hall's inhabitants was a nearby well. A number of earthworks surrounded the hall, although the exact date of these has not been ascertained. Why the hall was abandoned is not clear, but possibilities include a failure in the water supply, a rapid impoverishment of the sandy soil found in the surrounding fields, or the impact of the Black Death. There was no archaeological evidence suggesting that the house might have been devastated by fire.\n\nDuring the Second World War, two RAF Hawker Hurricane fighters crashed in the wood and some hollows visible in the wood are bomb craters. A wooden sculpture of a crashed Hurricane lies just west of Faesten Dic, carved by local sculptor Peter Leadbeater.\n\nJoyden's Wood Estate\nJoydens Wood Estate is home to several thousand people. Amenities include a post office, butcher, pharmacy, library, petrol station as well as local infant and junior schools. Community groups that meet at the Joydens Wood Community Centre in Birchwood Drive include a pre-school, a Women's Institute and a table tennis club. St Barnabas' Church in Tile Kiln Lane has a multi-purpose building used both by the church and community groups. The scouts and guides have a hall; there is also a Freeholders' Association.\nLocal authority administration of the estate is split between the London Borough of Bexley within Greater London and the Borough of Dartford within Kent.\n\nDemography \nAccording to the 2011 census, 86% of the population is White British.\n\nTransport\n\nRail\nThe nearest National Rail station to Joyden's Wood is Bexley, located 1.8 miles away.\n\nBuses\nJoyden's Wood is served by Go-Coach route 429 (Monday to Saturday) to Dartford and Swanley and London Buses route B12 to Erith via Bexleyheath.\n\nNearby areas\nJoyden's Wood borders Dartford to the north, Wilmington to the north east and east, Hextable to the south east, Swanley to the south, Ruxley to the south west, North Cray to the west and Bexley to the north west.\n\nReferences\n\nFootnotes\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n\nJoyden's Wood Section of the Woodland Trust Website\nWilmington Parish Council\nJoyden's Wood Junior School\nArriva Buses\nGo-Coach 429 PDF Timetable\nSt Barnabas Church, Joydens Wood\n\nWoodland Trust\nForests and woodlands of Kent\nParks and open spaces in the London Borough of Bexley\nBorough of Dartford", "The Saab 92 was the first production car from Saab. The design was very aerodynamic for its time, with a drag coefficient (cx or cw) of 0.30. The entire body was stamped out of one piece of sheet metal and then cut to accommodate doors and windows. Full-scale production started December 12, 1949, based on the prototype Ursaab. All of them were of the Deluxe version. A standard version was advertised, but nobody was interested in buying it so no standard versions were produced.\n\nThe engine was a transversely-mounted, water-cooled two-cylinder, two-stroke 764\u00a0cc displacement, 25\u00a0hp (19\u00a0kW) engine based on a DKW design, giving a top speed of . The transmission had three gears, the first unsynchronised. In order to overcome the problems of oil starvation during overrun (engine braking) for the two-stroke engine, a freewheel device was fitted. The suspension was by torsion bars.\n\nAll early Saab 92s were painted in a dark green colour similar to British racing green. According to some sources, Saab had a surplus of green paint from wartime production of airplanes; \"All the cars were painted bottle green, a colour that became something of a trade mark for Saab cars. The underlying reason was that the armed forces had bought large quantities of a green cellulose paint for camouflage painting. However, the paint did not suit the terrain and the entire consignment of paint was sold off. Saab bought it and that was why both the aircraft and cars ended up green.\"\n\nSaab's rally history already started two weeks after the 92 was released, when Saab's head engineer Rolf Mellde entered the Swedish Rally and came second in his class.\n\nOnly 700 1950 models were made. In 1951, the German VDO instruments were replaced by American Stewart-Warner components.\n\nIn 1952 Greta Molander won the 'Coupe des Dames' of the 0 in a 92, tuned to 35\u00a0hp (26\u00a0kW). In 1953, the 92B arrived with a much larger rear window and larger luggage space (with an opening lid). It was now available in grey, blue-grey, black and green. In 1954 the Saab 92 got the new Solex 32BI carburetor and a new ignition coil giving 28\u00a0hp (21\u00a0kW). The US headlights were replaced with Hella units. Another novelty was that a textile roof (semi-cab or cabrio coach) was offered as an option. The colour maroon was also introduced this year. In 1955, it acquired an electric fuel pump and square tail lights installed in the rear fenders. The colours were grey, maroon and a new color, moss green.\n\nThe English aviation test pilot 'Bob' Moore, who had helped to develop the Saab Tunnan (J29) jet aircraft, brought a 1955 Saab 92B back to England, when he returned, later to become the first managing director of Saab GB Ltd. This was reputedly the first-ever Saab car imported to the UK.\n\nThe Saab 93 was introduced in December 1955, but both the 92B and 93 were produced at the same time, for a while. The last 92 was assembled in late 1956\u2013early 1957. Two new colours, grey-green and beige, were available. A total of 20,128 Saab 92s were made.\n\nThe Saab 92 appears on a Swedish postage stamp.\n\nWhen General Motors in 2008 made a list of their top ten cars, the Saab 92 came in first followed by the Pontiac GTO (1964), the Chevrolet Corvette (1953), the EV1 (1996), the Opel Olympia (1936), the LaSalle (1927), the Chevrolet Bel Air (1955), the Cadillac V16 (1930), the Cadillac Model 30 (1910) and the Cadillac (1912)  This is quite surprising because GM did not own  SAAB until 1989.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Saabmuseum.com\n\nFront-wheel-drive vehicles\n92\nCompact cars\n1950s cars\nCars introduced in 1949\nCoup\u00e9s\nStreamliner cars", "Pennsylvania Railroad 5550 (PRR 5550) is a mainline duplex drive steam locomotive under construction in the United States. With an estimated completion by 2030, the locomotive will become the 53rd example of the Pennsylvania Railroad's T1 steam locomotive class and the only operational locomotive of its type. The estimated cost of PRR 5550 was originally $10 million, but an updated projected cost of $7 million was released with the acquisition of an existing long-haul tender from the Western New York Railway Historical Society in August 2017. Construction began in 2014 with the casting of the locomotive's keystone-shaped number plate. Major components, including two Boxpok drivers, the prow, the cab, third-course boiler, and fire door have been completed.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe original T1 Class\n\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad class T1 class steam locomotive was one of the most unique and controversial classes of locomotives ever constructed. This was due to its unusual duplex drive 4-4-4-4 wheel arrangement, its use of the Franklin Type A oscillating-cam poppet valve, and its characteristic streamlining conceived by renowned industrial designer Raymond Loewy. The T1 was also the only class of Pennsylvania duplex able to travel the railroad's entire network and the first production series locomotive designed to use the poppet valve. The two prototype T1 locomotives were constructed in 1942 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works, numbered 6110 and 6111 respectively. Of the fifty production units, twenty-five (numbered 5500 to 5524) were constructed at the Pennsylvania Railroad's Altoona Works and twenty-five (numbered 5525 to 5549) at Baldwin, for a total of fifty-two T1 class locomotives. This made the T1 the most-produced of all the Pennsylvania Railroad's duplex-drive locomotives.\n\nThe T1 class suffered from several performance and design issues, including difficulties with the poppet valves. The original materials used to construct the valves were subject to fatigue issues, particularly when the locomotives were operated above 100 miles an hour. In 1947, a higher-strength and fatigue-resistant alloy was used and retrofitted to the T1 class to solve the fatigue problems. Nevertheless, the design of the Franklin Type A poppet valves made several key areas of the valves hard to access during maintenance overhauls. Despite these issues, the poppet valves did improve the T1's high-speed performance, requiring less horsepower and distributing steam flow with greater precision. The T1 locomotives were further burdened by excessive wheel slip on one of the two engine sets at startup or high speed. The Pennsylvania Railroad tried to address the problem by changing the spring bed arrangement on the T1\u2014from a single bed, supporting all eight drivers, to two beds, each of which supported one of the engines and its adjacent truck. However, no complete solution was found to the problem of wheel slip, even though an \"anti-slip\" mechanism had been previously installed on the PRR Q2-class duplex. One possible reason is that the engineers, familiar with the slower throttle action of the K4 class, were unprepared for the T1's more immediate throttle response.\n\nBefore many of the problems that plagued the T1 class could be solved, the Pennsylvania Railroad decided to begin the transition from steam power to diesel. Moreover, these problems ensured that the T1 class would be retired before more reliable steam engine classes such as the K4s. The T1 locomotives were retired between 1952 and 1953. Scrapping began in 1953, and the last surviving T1 was scrapped in 1956. The hasty retirement of the T1 left several performance-related and technical questions unanswered.\n\nThe T1 Trust\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad T1 Steam Locomotive Trust, also referred to as the T1 Trust, is a non-profit public charity founded in 2013. The T1 Trust is composed of railroading experts who intend to build the 53rd member of the T1 class and put it into mainline steam excursion service within the United States. The last production T1 bore the number 5549, making 5550 the logical choice for the new locomotive's number. The T1 Trust's goal was to construct the locomotive within 17 years (by 2030) at an estimated cost of $10 million. The price is based on calculated costs for inflation, labor, material, fabrication, retooling, and design. Lessons learned during Tornado's construction in the U.K. were also taken into account. The T1 Trust chose to build a T1, rather than a proven design such as the New York Central Railroad's \"J\" class Hudsons, to test the T1 class's long-rumored performance and to avoid conflicts of interest with other locomotive replication projects.\n\nWorld Steam Speed Record\nThe builders of PRR 5550 hope to break the world steam speed record, which is held by the LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard at . The 5550 will operate under its original design with no major modifications in its attempt to break the record. It has been unofficially reported that PRR T1 locomotives were capable of achieving speeds in excess of  with fully loaded trains, and the T1 Trust believes the original T1 design is capable of achieving this feat.\n\nDesign and construction\n\nProject leadership, techniques and organization\nThe chairman of the T1 Trust is Bradford Noble, with Scott McGill the Chief Mechanical Officer, Wes Camp the Director of Operations, and Jason Johnson the General Manager. The project structure is similar to that used by the A1 Trust to accomplish the funding and construction of Tornado. To do this, the T1 Trust reached out to the UK-based A1 Trust and its engineering director, David Elliot, who gave important advice on organizational structure and engineering techniques to be used when critical information or blueprints regarding specific locomotive parts or needed materials are absent. Other UK-based organizations that are helping or working with the T1 Trust include the BR Class 8 Steam Locomotive Trust, the Caprotti Black 5 Limited and the P2 Steam Locomotive Company. The T1 Trust has sponsorship programs, where donors can choose to sponsor driving wheels or other parts of the locomotive as well as sponsoring blueprints. This along with occasional Kickstarter campaigns, regular monthly donations, one-time donations and membership for the Trust's \"Founders Club\" help raise the money necessary to construct the locomotive. The CMO of the Trust, Scott McGill, visited the Pennsylvania State Archives in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania where he scanned hundreds of original drawings and blueprints of the Pennsylvania Railroad class T1 from the Pennsylvania Railroad collection into digital formats. By November 2016, most of the scanning work had been completed with 1,638 of the 1,798 needed drawings and blueprints having been scanned and acquired by the T1 Trust. Only 150 of the drawings are missing from the collection, and these are composed mainly of simple fasteners and other readily-available, commercial components. The digitally-scanned drawings collected by the T1 Trust are used to create detailed and intricate 3D Models using the Dassault Syst\u00e8mes Solidworks Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) program. For construction of the locomotive's many pieces and components, the T1 Trust contracts with different manufacturers and organizations such as the Strasburg Rail Road or Diversified Rail Services. The T1 Trust also prints a quarterly newsletter called the T1 Trail Blazer, which is received by members of the Trust's \"Keystone Society\": a group of donors that either pledge life income gifts to the Trust or pledge to list the Trust as an estate beneficiary. In September 2016, Doyle McCormack, a locomotive engineer best known for restoring and operating the 4-8-4 GS-4 class steam locomotive Southern Pacific 4449, joined the T1 Trust as a member of the organization's advisory board.\n\nFirst signs of progress\nConstruction of PRR 5550 was officially started on May 31, 2014, with the completion of the locomotive's bronze keystone-shaped number plate, following a successful conclusion to the initial Kickstarter campaign launched by the Trust. The number plate was forged by traditional methods by a member of the T1 Trust, Chuck Blardone, at an Amish forge within Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. This was followed by the construction of the first driving link pin, in October 2014. On May 2, 2014, the T1 Trust began meetings and discussions with the Federal Railroad Administration to help ensure that PRR 5550 is constructed to FRA standards. The T1 Trust's application to the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to operate as a federally approved tax-exempt 501(3)(c) charity was approved in July 2014. By March 2015, Steamtown National Historic Site, the Steam Railroading Institute and the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad expressed interest to the T1 Trust to have the locomotive run on their premises. A part sponsor named Gary Bensman constructed the headlight of PRR 5550 in May 2015 and donated it to the T1 Trust. As a sign of gratitude, Bensman's name was engraved into the headlight by the Trust.\n\nWheelset and engine assembly\n\n5550 is slated to use the Franklin Type B2 rotary-cam poppet valves in place of the Type A oscillating-cam poppets due to an increased ease of maintenance and superior performance. Although an unusual arrangement, it is not the first time the Type B poppets were used on a Pennsylvania Railroad class T1. In 1948, T1 number 5500 was rebuilt to use the Type B2 poppets following a damaging collision with a K4s in St. Louis, Missouri. 5500 was soon noted for its superior performance over the other engines of its class. The Pennsylvania Railroad at one point even considered retrofitting the Type B2 poppets to other T1's, but this action was never taken. It is worth noting the Pennsylvania Railroad also experimented with the idea of fitting the conventional Walschaerts valve gear to the T1 and retrofitted number 5547 to such a configuration. To aid in the reconstruction of the Type B2 poppets, the T1 Trust was generously given full access to the USATC S160 Class 2-8-0 USATC No. 611 by Bill Miller Equipment Sales. USATC 611 is located along with its owner in Eckhart Mines, Maryland. USATC 611 was fitted with Franklin Type D rotary-cam poppet valves during the 1950s during its career at Fort Eustis, Virginia. The T1 Trust hopes to do a full inspection and documentation of key features within the Type D poppets to use as a basis for reconstructing the Type B2 poppets proposed for use on 5550. It is also hoped that the investigative work and documentation can aid a future restoration of USATC 611. The P2 Steam Locomotive Company is also planning on using the Franklin Type B Rotary Cam poppet valve (albeit the earlier B1 model) for the proposed new build LNER Class P2 steam locomotive, No. 2007 Prince of Wales, and has shared valuable design documents with the T1 Trust needed to reproduce the valve. Components of the Caprotti valve gear will be examined to help recreate the gear box of the Type B2 poppet valve, as some of the original blueprints of the Type B2 gearbox have been lost. The copies of design documents and blueprints of the Caprotti gearbox were provided by the BR Class 8 Steam Locomotive Trust and Caprotti Black 5 Limited.\n\nThe eight Boxpok driving wheels of the original T1's were  in diameter. This design is of a higher strength than conventional spoked driving wheels and is ideal for high-speed operations. On July 8, 2015, the T1 Trust launched a Kickstarter campaign titled \"Let's Get Rolling\" to raise $20,000, to be used in the design and building of a casting pattern for the new Boxpok drivers. The campaign reached over its goal and construction began on the casting patterns, which were finished in October 2015. Construction of the casting patterns was undertaken by Liberty Pattern in Youngstown, Ohio using a complex CAD model made of PRR 5550's proposed number-four wheelset. Casting of the drivers was awarded to Beaver Valley Alloy in Monaca, Pennsylvania On February 26, 2016, Beaver Valley Alloy cast the first of eight driving wheels at its foundry successfully. This historic event marked the first time a steam locomotive driving wheel had been cast in the United States since the 1940s. A second driver was ordered on December 9, 2016, and was cast by Beaver Valley Alloy on March 6, 2017. The second Boxpok driver was delivered to the T1 Trust on March 15, 2017, and placed next to the first completed driver. Both drivers represent the number four wheelset.\n\nAluminum components\nThe cab of the locomotive is of aluminum construction. This is not a new feature, as the cabs of the previous T1s were also made of aluminum, which was done to reduce weight. The streamlining of the locomotive, like the cab, also consists of aluminum construction. Digitization of the original cab blueprints was undertaken by JAKTOOL in Cranbury, New Jersey. On January 18, 2017, the frames and main components of the cab were cut by Gemini Industrial Machine in Dover, Ohio, beginning construction of the cab.  Construction of the cab was contracted to Curry Rail Services in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. By coincidence, the facility currently housing Curry Rail Services was previously the Pennsylvania Railroad's Samuel Rea Car Shops. The cab was completed on July 10, 2017, albeit unpainted.\n\nConstruction on the \"prow\" portion of the locomotive's streamlining, also made of aluminum, began on November 10, 2016, by Gemini Industrial Machine. This part of the structure houses the headlight and keystone number plate. Using existing CAD models, a water jet cutter, bodywork, fabrication and paint, the prow was completed on May 16, 2017, with the headlight and keystone number plate attached.\n\nLocomotive frame\nAs of fall 2017, the frame of PRR 5550 was being transferred from original Pennsylvania Railroad blueprints to CAD software by JAKTOOL. The model is reported to be around 30 percent complete, with all work hours being donated. Both the left and right sides of the frame structure are expected to be symmetrical.\n\nBoiler\nOn January 26, 2018, the T1 Trust announced it had ordered the first and second courses of the massive boiler. The courses are the largest parts of PRR 5550 ordered to date. The first two sections of the boiler will be constructed from  thick boiler code steel and will each be  in diameter and  in length. The sections will be welded and will include openings for water refilling along with washout plugs. Once finished, the welds made will be x-rayed to detect and prevent any possible defects or flaws. The order was placed with Continental Fabricators in St. Louis, Missouri, which as of February 2018 is involved in at least 3 other steam engine boiler construction projects and has been involved in steam locomotive projects since the 1980s. On March 6, 2018, the first two boilers courses were completed and welded-together, and, on June 15, 2018, the third boiler course was completed and welded to the first two.\n\nThe design of 5550's boiler was handled by the T1 Trust's boiler engineering team, led by Wolf Fengler. Others working on the design of the boiler included Trust members Gary Bensman, Dave Griner, Scott McGill and Jason Johnson. The team re-engineered the T1 boiler and firebox design to exceed current ASME standards and codes. In December 2019, the Trust officially launched a campaign to raise the necessary $150,000 to build the firebox.\n\nIn 2020, the full boiler was completed and welded together. The smokebox, smokebox streamlining, and combustion chamber have also been completed. These components were joined along with the prow by the end of 2020.\n\nTender\nOn August 7, 2017, the T1 Trust purchased the sole surviving \"Coast to Coast\" 16-wheeled tender from the Western New York Railway Historical Society for eventual use on PRR 5550. According to the Trust, the purchase of said tender reduces the overall cost of the project by at least $3,000,000 US. The tender, No. 6659, is a class 210-F-75A originally built for an M1 class 4-8-2 Mountain type. At some point in its existence, the mechanical stoker and \"doghouse\" structure were removed when the Pennsylvania Railroad converted it into a mobile water tank. Prior to the sale, the Historical Society planned to display the tender behind PRR 4483, an I1sa class 2-10-0 locomotive. Currently, the tender sits in North Collins, New York. The Trust agreed to help restore the tender currently paired with the Historical Society's I1sa as part of the M1 tender purchase agreement. The Trust plans to perform a mandatory test of the tender's brake system, restore the brake systems, replace the oil in the roller bearings and move the tender to Hamburg, New York for repainting and final restoration. To help fund the tender restoration, the Trust has created a separate donation fund for this task and will display the names of all donors who pledge $500 or higher to the fund on a bronze plaque placed upon the tender itself. The total cost of the tender restoration is estimated to be more than $50,000. On October 5, 2017, an automatic coal stoker was donated to the Trust.

The locomotive will burn oil rather than coal and have multiple-unit compatibility with diesel locomotives. It will also have a modern 26-L braking system and a wheel-slip alarm. Though capable of operating on the main line it would not be economical to do so and will likely operate up to  on branch lines.\n\nSee also\nLNER Peppercorn Class A1 60163 Tornado\nLMS-Patriot Project\nGWR 6800 Class 6880 Betton Grange\nSteam locomotives of the 21st century\nDuplex locomotive\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\nStaufer, Alvin (1962).

The company specialises in taking on what they perceive to be 'dormant' texts and bringing them to life, making them accessible to modern theatre audiences. They strive to keep admission costs to their productions low to draw in audiences who would not normally go to the theatre.\n\nMetra Theatre consists of artistic director Tanya Roberts, Jessica Stanley, Josephine Rogers, and Lee-Diep Chu.\n\nMeasure for Measure\nNine graduating students, fresh from London Metropolitan University were chosen to perform William Shakespeare's Measure for Measure at the International Shakespeare festival in Gda\u0144sk, Poland as part of the education program. the performance was directed by lecturers Gian Carlo Rossi and Lucy Richardson with vocal coach acek Ludwig Scarso.  As was to become a staple factor in Metra's work, the development of the production drew heavily from the ideas of philosopher Gilles Deleuze.  Deleuze refers to ideas as being rhizome, meaning a thick underground stem or root system. It stretches out, reaching into all dimensions, rebelling against its own foundations and outgrowing beginnings and endings.\n\nAlthough the production was a modern reworking, it used Shakespeare's original language and attempted to present it in a way that resonates today, not by replacing and resetting it in a parallel era or context, but by drawing on many different ideas, concepts, styles, techniques and quirks, and bring them together to form a unique, explorative and un-unified piece of theatre.  Metra Theatre later described it as tackling Measure for Measure \u2018with feminist foresight, socio-religious thinking and a bit of jive to boot\u2019.\n\nIn early 2006, Metra Theatre showcased a new version of the performance - including an Aerial Dance performed by Francesca Hyde - at The Lion and Unicorn pub theatre in Kentish Town, London.  The production was popular and received a glowing review from Wendy Attwell (of The Shakespeare Revue).  The response to this production contributed heavily to Metra's passion in making theatre more accessible, and drawing in new audiences who wouldn't necessarily go to see a classical play for fear of 'not getting it'.\n\nSimon McPhillips with Lucky Strike Productions and Press On Features went on to use an adapted version of the script in a film version of play.  The film was set in a modern-day army base, with Josephine Rogers continuing on with her role as Isabella.\n\nLysistrata\nMetra Theatre performed their second production, a modern take on Aristophanes' Lysistrata (using the Dudley Fitts' translation) in July 2006, their first production developed without the guidance of their lecturers.  Continuing on with the Deleuzian theory that Measure for Measure was rooted in, they intuitively jetted through a range of different sources and concepts which have a root in the context of the play, without feeling any pressure to be part of unified theme or universal conclusion.  Metra utilised the Essentialist Feminism that is present in the text, drawing on music and dance from the 1920s, evoking a time when women were slowly but firmly rejecting the image of the submissive, dependent housewife. Lysistrata was performed at the Brickhouse on Brick Lane in East London.  The production continued Metra's use of different disciplines by incorporating static trapeze and the 1920s Charleston style of dance.\n\nThe Revenger's Tragedy\nMetra Theatre's third production was a take on Thomas Middleton's The Revenger's Tragedy, directed by Tanya Roberts and performed as part of the Enterprise 08 Festival at the Space Theatre in Isle of Dogs.\n\n3 Sisters\nMetra Theatre's fourth production was an adaptation of Anton Chekhov's Three Sisters performed on a moving canal barge.  The first run took place in November, 2008 along the Regent's Canal in Camden. Over the next three years, Metra Theatre embarked on a sell-out national tour of '3 Sisters', performing in Bath (Bath Fringe Festival), Cardiff (Wales Millennium Centre), Edinburgh Fringe Festival, The Secret Garden Party, Manchester, The Lowry, Oxford. Oxford Playhouse, until finally returning the show to London.\n\nShakin' the Blues Away\nMetra Theatre's latest production explores the lives of Katharine Hepburn, Rita Hayworth, and Ann Miller. Set to tour in late 2014.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nOfficial company website\n Wendy Attwell's review of Measure for Measure\nUkscreen profile\nTeatrum Gedanese Foundation\n The Space\n Maddy Ryle's review of The Revenger's Tragedy\nSkye Crawford's review of 3 Sisters\nArticle in the Independent by Alice Jones\nReview of 3 Sisters by BroadwayBaby.com\nInterview with the director and cast of 3 Sisters from EdFest TV\nReview of 3 Sisters by TimeOut\nReview of 3 Sisters by the Herald\nReview of 3 Sisters by Three Weeks\n\nTheatre companies in London", "European Conference on Radar in Meteorology and Hydrology (ERAD) is an international scientific conference that is organised every two years from 2000.\n\nThe idea of ERAD, which has been perpetuated since its first edition in 2000, is to create an open forum between students, academics, engineers, end users and operational radar operators working with or using weather radars and weather radar data.

He closely resembled his father, and portrayed him in four feature films: Frontier Marshal (1939), Lillian Russell (1940), Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), and Wilson (1944), and again in a 1964 telefilm about the family's early days in vaudeville. Additional film credits include The Farmer Takes a Wife, The Pajama Game, Bells Are Ringing, and Gidget Goes Hawaiian.\n\nFoy found steady work with the advent of television. In addition to a leading role in the first hour-long sitcom, Fair Exchange, he made numerous guest appearances on such programs as The Gisele MacKenzie Show, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Glynis, My Living Doll, Burke's Law, ABC Stage 67, My Three Sons, and Nanny and the Professor.\n\nPersonal life\nIn 1933, Foy married Anna Marie McKenney. They had a son, Eddie Foy III, and she died in 1952.\n\nDeath\nFoy died of pancreatic cancer in Los Angeles on July 15, 1983 at age 78.

Ackerman was a long-time fan, and at the time was the literary agent for science fiction authors Ray Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, A.E. Van Vogt, Curt Siodmak and L. Ron Hubbard. Ackerman pronounced his new term as  or \"sigh figh\". In the 1970s, some members of science fiction fandom began to pronounce the term  or \"skiffy\" for unclear reasons.\n\nPeter Nicholls writes that \"SF\" (or \"sf\") is \"the preferred abbreviation within the community of sf writers and readers.\" David Langford's monthly fanzine Ansible includes a regular section \"As Others See Us\" which offers numerous examples of \"sci-fi\" and \"skiffy\" being used in a pejorative sense by people outside the genre.\n\nSkiffy is the name of the science fiction and fantasy club at the College of William and Mary, and VCU, as well as not always affectionate shorthand for the American cable channel once named The Sci-Fi Channel.\n\nIn 1998, Mike Resnick and Patrick Nielsen Hayden released a book called Alternate Skiffy,.

The premiere was aired at the 2015 South by Southwest (SXSW) Film Festival. El porvenir is an inside look at the world of Mexican cockfighting, where men and roosters meet at the intersection of life, death, and sport.\n\nPlot \nThis short documentary follows Abelardo Olgu\u00edn Cuevas, a third-generation Mexican cockfighter struggling to hold on to his family's traditions in the face of a growing movement to ban the sport across the country. Cockfighting has been Abelardo's passion since he was five years old. Now, with children of his own, he hopes to pass on tradition, but he and his fellow cockfighters see the world changing before their eyes.\n\nThe film explores Abelardo's day-to-day life in Ixmiquilpan, Central Mexico, from his farm, where he trains his roosters, to the cockfighting tournaments. A unique glimpse into the vibrant and controversial culture of cockfighting.\n\nAbout the film \nThe director's goal in dealing with this controversial subject was to remain as objective as possible and not pass any judgment.

The thyroid gland is located on the front of the neck below the laryngeal prominence, and makes hormones that control metabolism.\n\nSigns and symptoms\n\nThere are many different signs and symptoms for thyroiditis, none of which are exclusively limited to this disease. Many of the signs imitate symptoms of other diseases, so thyroiditis can sometimes be difficult to diagnose. Common hypothyroid symptoms manifest when thyroid cell damage is slow and chronic, and may include fatigue, weight gain, feeling \"fuzzy headed\", depression, dry skin, and constipation. Other, rarer symptoms include swelling of the legs, vague aches and pains, decreased concentration and so on. When conditions become more severe, depending on the type of thyroiditis, one may start to see puffiness around the eyes, slowing of the heart rate, a drop in body temperature, or even incipient heart failure. On the other hand, if the thyroid cell damage is acute, the thyroid hormone within the gland leaks out into the bloodstream causing symptoms of thyrotoxicosis, which is similar to those of hyperthyroidism. These symptoms include weight loss, irritability, anxiety, insomnia, fast heart rate, and fatigue. Elevated levels of thyroid hormone in the bloodstream cause both conditions, but thyrotoxicosis is the term used with thyroiditis since the thyroid gland is not overactive, as in the case of hyperthyroidism.\n\nCauses\n\nThyroiditis is generally caused by an immune system attack on the thyroid, resulting in inflammation and damage to the thyroid cells. This disease is often considered a malfunction of the immune system and can be associated with IgG4-related systemic disease, in which symptoms of autoimmune pancreatitis, retroperitoneal fibrosis and noninfectious aortitis also occur. Such is also the case in Riedel thyroiditis, an inflammation in which the thyroid tissue is replaced by fibrous tissue which can extend to neighbouring structures. Antibodies that attack the thyroid are what causes most types of thyroiditis. It can also be caused by an infection, like a virus or bacteria, which works in the same way as antibodies to cause inflammation in the glands, such as in the case of subacute granulomatous thyroiditis (de Quervain). Certain people make thyroid antibodies, and thyroiditis can be considered an autoimmune disease, because the body acts as if the thyroid gland is foreign tissue. Some drugs, such as interferon, lithium, amiodarone and immune check point inhibitors can also cause thyroiditis.\n\nDiagnosis\nThe most common and helpful way to diagnose thyroiditis is first for a physician to palpate the thyroid gland during a physical examination. Laboratory tests allow doctors to evaluate the patient for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rates, elevated thyroglobulin levels, and depressed radioactive iodine uptake (Mather, 2007). Blood tests also help to determine the kind of thyroiditis and to see how much thyroid stimulating hormone the pituitary gland is producing and what antibodies are present in the body. In some cases, a biopsy may be needed to find out what is attacking the thyroid.\n\nClassification\n\nThyroiditis is a group of disorders that all cause thyroidal inflammation. Forms of the disease are Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the US, postpartum thyroiditis, subacute thyroiditis, silent thyroiditis, drug-induced thyroiditis, radiation-induced thyroiditis, acute thyroiditis, and Riedel's thyroiditis.\n\nEach different type of this disease has its own causes, clinical features, diagnoses, durations, resolutions, conditions, and risks.\n\nTreatment\nTreatments for this disease depend on the type of thyroiditis that is diagnosed. For the most common type, which is known as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, the treatment is to immediately start hormone replacement. This prevents or corrects the hypothyroidism, and it also generally keeps the gland from getting bigger. However, Hashimoto's thyroiditis can initially present with excessive thyroid hormone being released from the thyroid gland (hyperthyroid). In this case the patient may only need bed rest and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications; however, some need steroids to reduce inflammation and to control palpitations. Also, doctors may prescribe beta blockers to lower the heart rate and reduce tremors, until the initial hyperthyroid period has resolved.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nMost types of thyroiditis are three to five times more likely to be found in women than in men. The average age of onset is between thirty and fifty years of age. This disease tends to be geographical and seasonal, and is most common in summer and fall.\n\nHistory\nHashimoto's thyroiditis was first described by Japanese physician Hashimoto Hakaru working in Germany in 1912. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is also known as chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, and patients with this disease often complain about difficulty swallowing. This condition may be so mild at first that the disease goes unnoticed for years. The first symptom that shows signs of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a goiter on the front of the neck. Depending on the severity of the disease and how much it has progressed, doctors then decide what steps are taken for treatment.\n\nSee also\n Hypothyroidism\n Hashitoxicosis\n Hyperthyroidism\n Hashimoto's disease\n Thyroid cancer\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n American Thyroid Association, \"What is Thyroiditis\"\n\nThyroid disease\nInflammations", "1958 in professional wrestling describes the year's events in the world of professional wrestling.\n\nList of notable promotions \nOnly one promotion held notable shows in 1958.\n\nCalendar of notable shows\n\nChampionship changes\n\nEMLL\n\nNWA\n\nDebuts\nDebut date uncertain:\nAbdullah the Butcher\n\u00c1ngel Blanco\nDominic DeNucci\nGene Anderson\nKurt Von Steiger\nPat Patterson\nToru Tanaka\nMarch  Don Manoukian\nMay 2  El Matem\u00e1tico\nJune  Johnny Saint\nNovember 11  Pedro Morales\n\nBirths\nJanuary 4  Jim Powers\nJanuary 5  Awesome Kong(died in 2012)\nJanuary 8  Rey Misterio\nJanuary 10  Jerry Estrada\nJanuary 30  Rocky King (died in 2022) \nJanuary 31  Dave Finlay\nFebruary 3  Kerry Brown (wrestler) (died in 2009) \nFebruary 4  Outback Jack (wrestler)\nFebruary 7  Rusty Brooks (died in 2021)\nFebruary 8  Sensational Sherri(died in 2007)\nFebruary 19  Tommy Cairo\nMarch 10: \nM\u00e1scara A\u00f1o 2000\nPierroth Jr.\nMarch 16  Mike McGuirk\nMarch 22  Wayne Bloom\nMarch 24  Dieusel Berto (died in 2018) \nMarch 28  Curt Hennig(died in 2003)\nMarch 30  Mike Rotunda\nApril 17  Nailz\nMay 5  Wally Yamaguchi(died in 2019)\nMay 15  Ron Simmons \nMay 20  Nikolai Zouev (died in 2022)\nMay 28  Barry Orton(died in 2021)\nJune 2  Lex Luger\nJune 8  Dan Severn\nJune 16  Ted Arcidi\nJune 18  Tommy Stewart\nJune 23  George Takano\nJune 24:\nTiny Lister(died in 2020)\nChicky Starr\nJune 25  Damien Demento\nJuly 1  Tom Magee\nJuly 19  Robert Gibson\nJuly 22  David Von Erich(died in 1984)\nJuly 26  Romano Garcia \nAugust 12  Motor City Madman\nAugust 14  Bobby Eaton (died in 2021)\nAugust 22:\nStevie Ray\nBrady Boone(died in 1998)\nAugust 25  Len Denton\nAugust 30  King Kaluha\nSeptember 3  Shiro Koshinaka\nSeptember 20  Arn Anderson\nSeptember 6  The Barbarian\nOctober 15  Jeff Gaylord(died in 2023) \nOctober 20  Scott Hall(died in 2022) \nNovember 21:\nRicky Santana\nJohnny Rich \nNovember 26  El Texano(died in 2006)\nNovember 30  Tom Zenk(died in 2017)\nDecember 5  Dynamite Kid(died in 2018)\nDecember 7  Rick Rude(died in 1998)\nDecember 21  El Tirantes\n\nDeaths\nFebruary 23  Dean Detton, 49  \nApril 25  Herman Hickman, 46\nJune 20  Dan McLeod, 97 \nJuly 17  Americus, 74\n\nReferences\n\n \nprofessional wrestling", "The Calthorpe Clinic, (now Marie Stopes International Birmingham), was an abortion clinic in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England that first opened in 1969. It was the first clinic in the United Kingdom opened exclusively for abortions. It was erected at Arthur Road, in a building that was previously an old people's home and started out with 18 beds. The clinic provided surgical and medical terminations for thousands of women each year. By the 2000s, it also provided sterilisation, and vasectomy services.\n\nIn 1971, the cost of an abortion at the Calthorpe Clinic was \u00a365, including the initial consultations, tests, counselling and overnight accommodation.\n\nBy 2007, the establishment was the single largest abortion clinic in the UK with an annual caseload of around 10,000 clients. Approximately 85% of the caseload was on contract to the NHS. Due to the relative proximity of Birmingham to Ireland, and the fact that abortion was illegal in Ireland, the clinic also had many Irish clients. It was approved by the Secretary of State for Health under the Abortion Act 1967 and regulated by the Healthcare Commission and had to meet the national minimum standards set by the Care Standards Act 2000.\n\nIn February 2012, allegations were made by The Daily Telegraph newspaper that the clinic would provide terminations when the reason given was a desire not to have a child of a particular gender. In January and February 2012, the Care Quality Commission had made unannounced inspections of the clinic, as a result of which the clinic was warned, and a doctor suspended.

The US Bureau of Land Management owns and administers the wilderness area. The semi-arid wilderness includes few natural resources but has a diverse geology, as well as a range of plant and animal species.\n\nThere were multiple failed legislative attempts to establish the Sabinoso Wilderness, both as an individual bill as well as part of more comprehensive legislation, prior to the eventual success in 2009 as part of an omnibus bill. , the wilderness was inaccessible to the public without trespassing, as it and adjoining state-owned property were entirely surrounded by privately owned land. In conjunction with the Wyss Foundation, a plan to allow public access through the donation and purchase of additional adjacent lands was implemented and the wilderness opened to the public on November 10, 2017.\n\nLegislative history\nOn June 7, 2007, Tom Udall introduced H.R. 2632, the Sabinoso Wilderness Act of 2008, which would have set aside a total of 15,995 acres of land for the site. The bill passed the US House of Representatives on June 9, 2008 by a voice vote, but never passed the Senate.\n\nOn March 13, 2008, Ra\u00fal Grijalva introduced H.R. 5610, the Protecting America\u2019s Wild Places Act of 2008. Title III of the act, Sabinoso Wilderness, would have set aside 19,880 acres of land for the site. It was passed by neither the House nor the Senate.\n\nOn February 9, 2009, Ben Luj\u00e1n introduced H.R. 921, the Sabinoso Wilderness Act of 2009, which would have set aside 15,995 acres for the site, and was not passed by either chamber.\n\nSabinoso was finally established as part of the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009, signed into law by Barack Obama on March 30, 2009. Subtitle G Section 1602 reads:\n\nIn furtherance of the purposes of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.), the approximately 16,030 acres of land under the jurisdiction of the Taos Field Office Bureau of Land Management, New Mexico, as generally depicted on the map, is designated as wilderness and as a component of the National Wilderness Preservation System, to be known as the `Sabinoso Wilderness'.\n\nDescription\n\nThe Sabinoso Wilderness area consists of canyons and steep-sided mesas with elevations ranging from  to .  The mesa tops are grassland while the canyon walls support a pinyon pine and juniper woodland with scattered groves of ponderosa pine.  The area is semi-arid receiving  to  precipitation annually.\n\nThe canyon bottoms have periodically flowing streams, as well as deep incisions cut by the Ca\u00f1on Olguin, Ca\u00f1on Largo, and Lagartija Creek. Riparian vegetation such as cottonwood and willow trees is found along the ephemeral streams. Wildlife includes, elk, mule deer, black bear, and wild turkey.\n\nThe northeastern corner of the wilderness area is near the Canadian River and the 1890s settlement of Sabinoso, now mostly abandoned except for a few remaining buildings. No other settlements, except a few ranches, are near the wilderness area. The nearest city is Las Vegas, New Mexico, about 50 miles distant by road.\n\nGeology\nThe Sabino Wilderness contains a sequence of sedimentary rocks, which are close to flat lying or dipping very gently to the southeast. These rocks are almost entirely sandstones, siltstones, and shales, and represent geological time from the Late Triassic to the Early Cretaceous epochs. These rocks record a variety of paleoenvironments, including alluvial streams, floodplains, lakes and ponds, wind-blown eolian dunes, and in the youngest of the rocks, some sandy shallow marine settings.\n\nThe geological formations represented at the surface within the Wilderness include the Santa Rosa, Chinle, Entrada, Morrison, and Mesa Rica Formations. Buried beneath the area are Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and Precambrian crystalline rocks making up the geological basement.\n\nSeveral of the lithologies present in the Wilderness have eroded to form prominent cliffs, including the thick sandstone beds of the Chinle Formation, and the Entrada Sandstone. The former are reddish-brown to maroon; the latter a salmon-orange color.\n\nMineral resources\n\nIn 1987 the United States Geological Survey published a report on the mineral resources of Sabinoso. They concluded that \"no identified mineral resources were found in the study area.\" While they identified some occurrences of uranium associated with the Chinle Formation, the deposits were too small, scattered and low-grade to constitute a viable resources for uranium.\n\nCultural resources\nAs of 2013 the area had not been systematically surveyed for cultural resources. However, the archaeological record of the surrounding territory suggests a high density of prehistoric Paleo-Indian sites, as well as sites related to the period of homesteading and ranching, around the mid-19th century. Many of the artifacts which have been found in the area are centered along the Largo Canyon Road which is thought to be a pre-historic trail, as well as a road used by the United States Army to connect Fort Union and Fort Bascom.\n\nGrazing\nCattle grazing on Sabinoso is rare due to the relative scarcity of water. However, 10 grazing allotments had been granted as of 2013, with grazing taking place mostly in the southern portion of the area.\n\nPublic access\n\nSabinoso Wilderness Area is surrounded by privately owned land and initially had no route for public access. About a dozen state-owned parcels of land adjoin Sabinoso, but they are themselves also \"landlocked,\" entirely surrounded by privately owned property.\n\nIn 2016 the Wilderness Land Trust, financed by the Wyss Foundation, purchased the  Rimrock Rose Ranch for $3,150,000 with the goal of enabling public access to the area. The environmental evaluations needed before visitors would be allowed to enter the park, were estimated to require up to a year to complete, and were made available for public comment as of August 2016.\n\nIn August 2016, The Bureau of Land Management proposed to accept a donation of  of the Rimrock Rose Ranch for addition to the Wilderness Area.  The BLM proposed to purchase the remaining  of the ranch, as well as  of inholdings. They also plan to cancel two allotments for livestock grazing to alleviate the impact on the sparse riparian environments. The transfer of the land was finalized in 2017.\n\nThe Wilderness became open to the public on November 10, 2017, accessible from an improved dirt road along San Miguel County Road C51A. Ryan Zinke, the United States Secretary of the Interior stated \"the Sabinoso Wilderness Area is finally open and accessible to hunters and all members of the public for the first time ever.\"\n\nOn July 17, 2021, Secretary of the Interior Debra Haaland accepted a donation of 9,855 acres, which both increased the size of the designated wilderness area by about 50% and provided for a second public access point.\n\nSee also\n List of U.S. Wilderness Areas\n National Wilderness Preservation System\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nWilderness areas of New Mexico\nProtected areas of San Miguel County, New Mexico\nBureau of Land Management areas in New Mexico\nProtected areas established in 2009\n2009 establishments in New Mexico", "Dianne Sika\u2013Paotonu is a New Zealand immunologist, biomedical scientist and academic in the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine and Associate Dean (Pacific) at the University of Otago Wellington.

The national convention then selected its nominee to run for President of the United States in the 2012 presidential election. There were 2,286 delegates chosen, and a candidate needed to accumulate 1,144 delegate votes at the convention to win the nomination. The caucuses allocated delegates to the respective state delegations to the national convention, but the actual election of the delegates were, many times, at a later date. Delegates were elected in different ways that vary from state to state. They could be elected at local conventions, selected from slates submitted by the candidates, selected at committee meetings, or elected directly at the caucuses and primaries.\n\nThe primary contest began in 2011 with a fairly wide field. Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts and the runner-up in the 2008 primaries, had been preparing to run for president ever since the 2008 election, and was from early on the favorite to win the nomination. However, he lacked support from the party's conservative wing and the media narrative became: \"Who will be the anti-Romney candidate?\" Several candidates rose in the polls throughout the year. However, the field was down to four candidates by February 2012: Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, U.S. Congressman Ron Paul, former Governor Romney and former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum. It was the first presidential primary to be affected by a Supreme Court ruling that allowed unlimited independent expenditures to support or oppose candidates through super PACs.\n\nThree different candidates won the first three contests. Santorum, who had been running a one-state campaign in Iowa, narrowly won in that state's caucuses by a handful of votes over Romney (who was thought to have won the caucuses before a recount). Romney won New Hampshire, but lost South Carolina to Gingrich. From there, Romney regained his momentum by winning the crucial state of Florida, while Santorum took his campaign national and carried three more states before Super Tuesday, while Romney carried seven states.\n\nSuper Tuesday primaries took place on March 6. With ten states voting and 391 delegates being allocated, it had less than half the potential impact of its 2008 predecessor. Romney carried six states and Santorum three, while Gingrich won his home state of Georgia. Twelve more events were held in March, including all of the territorial contests and the first local conventions that allocated delegates (Wyoming's county conventions). Santorum won Kansas and three Southern primaries, but was unable to make any significant gains on Romney, who maintained a solid lead over all other contenders after securing more than half of the delegates allocated in the month of March.\n\nSantorum suspended his campaign on April 10, a week after losing Wisconsin and two other primaries to Romney. Gingrich followed suit on May 2, after the Republican National Committee (RNC) declared Romney the presumptive nominee on April 25 and put its resources behind him. On May 14, Paul announced that he would suspend funding the remaining primary contests and devote his resources to winning delegates at state conventions. He then won majorities in delegations of three states whose non-binding primaries had been in favor of other candidates. On May 29, Romney reached the nominating threshold of 1,144 delegates by most projected counts following his primary win in Texas and was congratulated by RNC Chairman Reince Priebus for \"securing the delegates needed to be our party's official nominee at our convention in Tampa.\" With his subsequent victories in California and several smaller states, Romney surpassed a majority of bound delegates on June 5.\n\nRomney chose congressman Paul Ryan to be his running mate, but they went on to lose the general election to incumbent President Barack Obama. Ryan later went on to serve a term as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives and Romney was elected to the U.S. Senate from Utah in 2018.\n\nCandidates\n\n2012 Republican nominee\n\nDid not withdraw \nMay 14, 2012, Paul announced that he would no longer actively campaign in states that have not held primaries, but rather focus on a strategy to secure delegates before the convention. Leading up to the convention, Ron Paul won bound pluralities of the official delegations from the states of Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Nevada, and Oregon (but not the Virgin Islands, despite winning the popular vote there). Due to disputes these were reduced to Iowa, Minnesota, and Nevada; however, he additionally had nomination-from-the-floor-pluralities in the states of Oregon and Alaska, plus the Virgin Islands. Although he wasn't named the 2012 Republican nominee, he did not officially end his campaign or endorse nominee Mitt Romney for president. At the convention, Ron Paul received second place with 8% of the delegates.\n\nWithdrew after the primaries \nKarger was not invited to any of the televised debates, but participated in the December WePolls.com online debate along with Gary Johnson and Buddy Roemer. He came in 4th place with 1,893 votes in Puerto Rico, 1,180 votes in Michigan, 10 votes in Iowa, 345 votes in New Hampshire, 377 votes in Maryland, 6,481 votes in his home state of California, and 545 votes in Utah, amounting up to a total of 10,831 votes. He withdrew following a 5th-place finish in the Utah primary, which was the final primary of the 2012 cycle. Karger received no delegate votes at the convention.\n\nWithdrew during the primaries \nThe following individuals participated in at least two presidential debates. They withdrew or suspended their campaigns at some point after the Iowa caucuses on January 3, 2012. They are listed in order of exit, starting with the most recent.\n\nDeclined to seek nomination \n\n Delegate Hard Count: This only included bound delegates that had to vote for a candidate even if they supported another candidate.\n Delegate Soft Count: This only included delegates allocated at the primaries and unallocated delegates that were elected at their local conventions or committees. It did not include any projections on future local conventions or the 117 unbound RNC delegates that were not a part of the primary election process. A breakdown of this historical count is found in the Primary Schedule below.\n Plurality: A candidate secured a delegation when he has the highest number of delegates that could vote for him on the first ballot in the nomination at the National Convention. According to RNC rules it took plurality in five delegations to be on the first ballot at the National Convention, and it took 1,144 delegates at the roll call of the ballots to become the Republican nominee.\n\nTimeline of the race\n\nThe primary contests took place from January 3 to July 14 and elected and allocated 2,286 voting delegates to the 2012 Republican National Convention in the week of August 27. To become the Republican Party's nominee for the 2012 presidential election a candidate needed a majority of 1,144 delegates to vote for him and plurality in five state delegations. The 2012 race was significantly different from earlier races. Many states switched from their old winner-take-all allocation to proportional allocation. Many remaining winner-take-all states allocated delegates to both the winner of each congressional district and the winner of the state. The change was made to prolong the race, giving lesser known candidates a chance and making it harder for a frontrunner to secure the majority early. It was also hoped that this change in the election system would energize the base of the party.\n\nMost of the candidates started their campaigns in mid-2011, but after the first two primaries in Iowa and New Hampshire, only four well-funded campaigns (Romney, Gingrich, Santorum, and Paul) remained for the Republican Party nomination; Gary Johnson had withdrawn to run on the Libertarian ticket, and Buddy Roemer sought the American Elect nomination. At the beginning of May, Gingrich and Santorum suspended their campaigns; Romney was widely reported as the presumptive nominee, with Paul the only other major candidate running an active campaign.\n\nBeginning (2011)\n\nThe 2008 Republican National Convention decided that the 2012 primary schedule generally would be subject to the same rules as the 2008 delegate selection contests, but on August 6, 2010, the Republican National Committee (RNC) adopted new rules for the timing of elections, with 103 votes in favor out of 144. Under this plan, allocation of delegates to the national convention were to be divided into three periods:\n February 1 \u2013 March 5, 2012: Contests of traditional early states Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina,\n March 6\u201331, 2012: Contests that proportionally allocate delegates,\n April 1, 2012, and onward: All other contests including winner-take-all elections.\nSeveral states, most notably Florida, scheduled their allocating contests earlier than prescribed, and in response every traditional early state except Nevada pushed their contests back into January. As a result of their violation of RNC rules, these states were penalized with a loss of half their delegates, including voting right for RNC delegates. Despite having early caucuses, Iowa, Maine, Colorado, Minnesota and Missouri were not penalized because their contests did not allocate national delegates.\n\nThe start of the 2012 Republican race for president was shaped by the 13 presidential debates of 2011, which began on May 5. Gary Johnson and Buddy Roemer, both former Governors, were left out of most of the debates, leading to complaints of bias. On December 28, 2011, Johnson withdrew to seek the Libertarian Party nomination and on February 23, 2012, Roemer withdrew to seek the Reform Party and the Americans Elect nomination.\n\nTwo candidates from the 2008 presidential primaries, Mitt Romney and Ron Paul, ran again in the 2012 primary campaign. Mitt Romney was the early frontrunner, and he maintained a careful, strategic campaign that centered on being an establishment candidate. In the summer of 2011, Romney had a lead in polls and the support of much of the Republican leadership and electorate. However, his lead over the Republican field was precarious, and the entry of new candidates drew considerable media attention. Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann started her campaign in June and surged in the polls after winning the Ames, Iowa, straw poll in August, knocking out former Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty and Michigan Congressman Thaddeus McCotter, who both withdrew after their poor showings in the non-binding Straw Poll failed to revive their struggling campaigns. Bachmann's momentum was short-lived. The same day that the Ames Straw Poll was being held, Texas Governor Rick Perry was drafted by strong national Republican support. He performed strongly in polls, immediately becoming a serious contender, and soon displaced Bachmann as Romney's major opponent. Perry in turn lost the momentum following poor performances in the September debates, and the third major opponent to Romney's lead, Herman Cain, surged after the sixth debate on September 22. In November, Cain's viability as a candidate was seriously jeopardized after several allegations of sexual harassment surfaced in the media. Although Cain denied the allegations, the fallout from the controversy forced him to suspend his campaign on December 3, 2011.\n\nIn November, as Herman Cain's campaign was stumbling, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich rose in the polls and asserted himself as the fourth major opponent to Romney. Gingrich had come back from serious staff problems in his campaign just weeks after he had entered the race in May that had seemingly derailed his campaign for the nomination. But in the weeks before the Iowa caucus, Gingrich's new-found lead began to quickly evaporate as super PACs sympathetic to Mitt Romney and others spent over $4.4 million in negative advertising targeting the former Speaker. With Gingrich's support faltering, Ron Paul surged to the lead in Iowa. Rick Santorum, who despite spending months traveling to all 99 counties in Iowa and holding some 381 town hall meetings, was polling in the single digits in Iowa as late as December 18. However, in the final weeks of 2011, Santorum positioned himself as the prime opposition to Romney with his staunch socially conservative views.\n\nOn the eve of the January 3, 2012 Iowa Caucus, the first real contest of the primary season, Paul, Santorum and Romney were all viewed as possible winners.\n\nEarly states (January to March)\n\n Six delegations had primary elections allocating 174 delegates\n Seven delegations had caucuses starting the process of electing 182 unallocated delegates\n\nIn 2012 there were 13 state contests before Super Tuesday, seven caucuses and 5 primaries. Missouri had a nonbinding straw poll in the form of a primary. Santorum spent months in Iowa, traveling to all 99 counties and holding some 381 town hall meetings. This one state campaign succeeded when he tied with Romney in the Iowa Caucuses on January 3. This first in the nation caucus propelled him into a national campaign while it ended Michele Bachmann's campaign. On the night of the caucuses, Romney was reported the winner of Iowa by only eight votes over Santorum, but after the results were certified, Santorum was declared the winner, beating Romney by 34 votes, despite the results from 8 districts being lost. Newt Gingrich said after Iowa that his positive campaign had been a weakness, and had allowed his rivals to gain the upper hand through negative attacks paid by super PACs supporting them.\n\nMitt Romney easily won the next contest, New Hampshire, his win seen as a given. Romney had persistently shown popularity in that state, but rivals were intensely fighting for a second-place finish there. Jon Huntsman, Jr., a moderate, had staked his candidacy on New Hampshire and invested heavily in at least a strong second place showing, but after 150 campaign events in the state he ended third after Paul. Both he and Rick Perry dropped out of the race shortly before voting day in South Carolina and the two delegates allocated to Huntsman became unbound.\n\nRomney was expected to virtually clinch the nomination with a win in South Carolina, but Gingrich, from neighboring Georgia, waged an aggressive and successful campaign winning all but one of the state's congressional districts. The Gingrich victory in South Carolina, together with two strong debate performances, gave him a second surge, opening the race to a longer and more unpredictable campaign.\n\nRomney did regain some of his momentum in the next two weeks and won the Florida primary and the Nevada caucuses. However, the race shifted again on February 7, when Santorum swept all three Midwestern states voting that day. By doing so he made a case for himself as the 'Not-Romney' candidate and disrupted Romney's narrative as the unstoppable frontrunner.\n\nFollowing his victories on February 7, Santorum received a huge boost in momentum as conservatives seeking an alternative to Romney began leaving Gingrich for Santorum. Numerous polls taken after Santorum's victories showed him either leading Romney nationally or close behind. To regain momentum Romney shelved his \"no straw polls\" policy and actively campaigned to win the CPAC straw poll, which he won with 38 percent to Santorum's 31 percent. He also campaigned in Maine, beating Ron Paul by only three percentage points.\n\nRegaining momentum Romney won the remaining four states. The candidates campaigned heavily in Michigan, and even though Romney won the state vote, he won only 7 out of 14 congressional districts, the rest going to Santorum. The allocation of two at-large delegates in the state was before the election was reported to be given proportionally. After the election Michigan GOP officials announced there had been an error in the memo published and that the two delegates would be given to the winner, sparking accusations of Romney rigging the results from Santorum's team. After thirteen contests the GOP field for the presidential nomination was still wide open.\n\n The numbers for delegates, states, and districts won in these tables include results from local conventions held in states which did not allocate their delegates at the precinct caucuses or primary election. These conventions were generally held on dates later than the table indicates.\n\n\u2020 The state did not allocate any delegates at its primary election, they were elected later.\n\nSuper Tuesday (March 6)\n\n Nine delegations had primary elections allocating 391 delegates\n North Dakota's delegation had caucuses starting the process of electing 25 unallocated delegates\n\nSuper Tuesday 2012 took place March 6 when the most simultaneous state presidential primary elections was held in the United States. This election cycle's edition of Super Tuesday, where 17.1 percent of all delegates was allocated, was considerably smaller than the 2008 edition, where 41.5 percent of all delegates was allocated (twenty-one states with 901 delegates). In 2012 delegates were allocated in primaries in seven states and their sixty five congressional districts together with binding caucuses in two states.\n\nNorth Dakota did not allocate any delegates at their caucuses, but had a consultative straw poll that the NDGOP leadership was required to use as a basic for making a party recommended slate of delegates. The persons on this slate was elected delegates at the April 1 state convention. According to Santorum and Paul supporters the slate was not as required based on the straw poll, but gave Romney a large majority of the delegates. The elected delegates have stated that they will divide up in such a way they reflect the caucus result, even if that means to vote for a candidate other than the one they support.\n\nRomney secured more than half of the delegates available on Super Tuesday but did not secure his status as the inevitable nominee. Gingrich pursued a \"southern strategy\", winning his home state of Georgia, and even though Santorum carried 3 states, he did not win them with a large enough margin to secure his status as the Not-Romney candidate. In the weeks leading up to March 6, both Gingrich and Santorum experienced ballot problems. The biggest issue was failing to appear on the Virginia primary ballot, leaving that race to Romney and Paul. With only two candidates on the ballot, Paul won 40 percent of the votes and carried one of Virginia's eleven congressional districts.\n\nSantorum had also failed to submit full or any delegate slates in nine of Ohio's congressional districts making him unable to win all delegates in those districts. The state became the big battleground of Super Tuesday and its delegates were split between Romney and Santorum, who won three congressional districts where he didn't have a full slate. This created four unallocated delegates, whose status was to be determined later. But Santorum suspended his campaign before the meeting in the Ohio GOP central committee deciding on the delegates took place and Romney dropped the dispute on May 4 in the interest of party unity.\n\nMid-March\n\n Seven delegations had primary election allocating 230 delegates\n Four smaller territories elected 24 delegates directly at their caucuses\n Two delegation had caucuses starting the process of electing 61 unallocated delegates\n\nAfter Super Tuesday all five territories had their contests. Puerto Rico held a primary and the four smaller insular areas (Guam, Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and U.S. Virgin Islands) had convention style caucuses where no straw polls were taken, therefore our table does not show popular vote percentages in these rows but the number of delegates committed to each candidate. Romney secured all but two delegates from the territories. Of the six selected delegates from the Virgin Islands, one was elected as uncommitted, and another bound to Paul. On the Virgin Islands every caucus goer had six votes that he or her could cast for six different delegates. Every person wanting to be a delegate needed to pledge to a candidate or declare to be 'uncommitted' before the voting started. The six persons with the most votes became National Convention delegates. Only four persons ran as delegates pledge to Romney and they all got elected. The persons that ran as delegates pledge to Paul got a plurality of the votes, but only one of them was elected.\n\nMissouri began its process of selecting national delegates with its caucuses from March 17 to April 10. The February primary was non-binding and as such nothing more than a non-binding strawpoll. Santorum won The Louisiana delegation securing 10 delegates for himself, but the election process for the major part of the delegates started at the caucuses on April 28.\n\nAs the first state with non-binding caucuses Wyoming elected delegates in the week of March 5. At the county conventions one delegate was elected as uncommitted, while eight delegates was committed to Romney, two to Santorum and one to Paul.\n\nBy winning three primaries in the South, Santorum disrupted Gingrich's \"Southern Strategy\" and took the lead as the 'Not-Romney' candidate. Gingrich won one congressional district and secured only 25 delegates in March. Three days after the Louisiana primary he announced a new \"National Convention strategy\", which includes laying off one-third of the campaign staff and spending less time on the road campaigning. He was at this point running out of money, having more campaign debt than cash on hand.\n\nRomney maintained a solid lead over all other contenders by securing more than half of the delegates allocated or elected in the month of March. He carried all five territories and two states. And even though he did not secure the nomination in March he continued to be the clear and strong front-runner.\n\nSantorum cruised to victory in Louisiana on March 24, reinforcing the narrative of the race thus far that the underdog Santorum could take the fight to the much more deep-pocketed and organized Romney.\n\n\u2020 The state did not allocate any delegates at its primary election, they were elected later.\n\nApril\n\n Eight state delegations had primary elections allocating 314 delegates\n Louisiana's delegation had caucuses starting the process of electing 28 unallocated delegates\n\nIn the last days of March, Romney received many endorsements as party leaders and establishment Republicans started to unite behind him. Most notable were the endorsement of former president George H. W. Bush and the endorsement of Paul Ryan, U.S. representative from Wisconsin and Chairman of the House Committee on the Budget.\n\nRyan, and U.S. Senator from Wisconsin Ron Johnson, campaigned with Romney before the April 3 primaries. The Super PACs supporting Romney also helped him to win the state using more than US$3 million, almost four times more than spend by the Super PAC supporting Santorum in Wisconsin. Santorum only won three districts in Wisconsin with Romney winning the other five and all eight districts in Maryland along with the federal District of Columbia where Santorum was not even on the ballot.\n\nWith momentum building for Romney, Santorum interrupted campaigning (as did Romney) for the Easter holiday to give his campaign staff a chance to be with their families. He used the opportunity to meet with \"movement conservatives\" to strategize. Four days later, on April 10, 2012, Rick Santorum suspended his campaign without endorsing any other candidate. He was at this point running out of money, having more campaign debt than cash on hand. Santorum won eleven contests (six states that allocated delegates and five non-binding caucus states) and forty-two delegate allocating congressional districts. More than 3.2 million people voted for him and he secured a total of 202 delegates before suspending his campaign. He can show a plurality in six states and that secures him the opportunity of a place on the first ballot nominating the Republican candidate for president at the National Convention.\n\nWith Santorum suspending his campaign, Gingrich saw a new hope of reasserting himself as the conservative alternative to Romney. His campaign had been scaling down since his March 24 defeat in the Louisiana primary and was $4.3 million in debt by the end of March. But now it began concentrating on the Delaware primary hoping a win there would be a game changer. The Adelson family that had already supported Gingrich heavily through the \"Winning Our Future\" super PAC gave another $5 million in late March bringing the PAC's cash on hand up to $5.8 million. But even with all the resources of the Gingrich campaign concentrated in Delaware he still lost the state with 29.4 percent to Romney. On May 2 he officially suspended his campaign. Gingrich won two contest (South Carolina and Georgia) nineteen delegate allocating congressional districts. More than 2.4 million people voted for him and he secured a total of 131 delegates before suspending his campaign. He could only show plurality in two states and was therefore not going to appear on the first ballot nominating the Republican candidate for president at the National Convention.\n\nFour states that didn't allocate delegates at their earlier caucuses had conventions in April. At the Wyoming state convention (April 12\u201314), just after Santorum had suspended his campaign, the state delegates united behind Romney and all 14 at-large delegates pledged to him. The same did not happen the same weekend at Colorado's state and district conventions. Santorum and Paul supporters came together to form the \"Conservative Unity Slate\" in an attempt to stop all the National Convention delegates from Colorado from supporting Romney. However, Romney won a narrow plurality in the state delegation despite this opposing slate. Missouri had its district conventions a week after (April 21). Santorum had carried every county at the nonbinding primary in February and many of his supporters threw their support to Romney who got half of the delegates. Paul won one out of the eight district conventions. Minnesota's district conventions were spread out over most of April and they were all but one won by Paul who secured a plurality in the state delegation even before the state convention in May.\n\nRomney won all eight primaries of the month and on April 25 the RNC declared Romney the presumptive nominee, putting resources behind him.\n\nMay\n\n Twelve delegations had primary elections allocating 679 delegates\n Two delegations had caucuses starting the process of electing 55 unallocated delegates\n\nOn May 2, 2012, Newt Gingrich \"mothballed\" his campaign saying that a second term of president Obama would be disastrous. Gingrich mentioned Republican front-runner Mitt Romney during his press speech, but did not endorse him. He intended to officially endorse Mr. Romney at a \"to-be-scheduled event\" featuring both Republican leaders. \"Today I am suspending the campaign, but suspending the campaign does not mean suspending citizenship,\" Gingrich said, with his wife Callista at his side.\n\nOn May 7, 2012, after Romney visited him, Santorum urged his supporters to back Romney's campaign and said, \"You can be sure that I will work with the governor to help him in this task to ensure he has a strong team that will support him in his conservative policy initiatives.\" \"We both agree that President Obama must be defeated,\" Santorum, 53, said in an e-mailed statement last night, \"[Romney] clearly understands that having pro-family initiatives are not only the morally and economically right thing to do, but that the family is the basic building block of our society.\"\n\nOn May 14, Paul announced that he would halt campaigning in states that had not yet at that point held their primaries, citing a lack of money needed to do so. Instead, the Paul campaign sought more delegates in state conventions in states that already held primaries.\n\nContinuing on May 15, Romney won the primaries in Oregon and Nebraska with Paul second in Oregon and Santorum second in Nebraska. On May 22, Romney swept Kentucky and Arkansas primaries. He claimed to have exceeded the nominating threshold in Texas, May 29. In fourth, Ron Paul worked behind the scenes to secure delegates in local caucuses following state primary elections. He later surpassed Gingrich, but not Santorum, behind front-runner Romney.\n\nJune\n\n Seven state delegations held primary elections or caucuses and allocated 586 delegates\n\nOn June 5, California, New Jersey, South Dakota, and New Mexico added 264 delegates to the Romney count, bringing his total to 1,480 pledged delegates, exceeding the requisite 1,144 delegates for nomination at the Republican National Convention. Despite this, the following week 123 mostly Paul-aligned delegates, currently legally bound to support Romney at the convention, brought an ongoing federal lawsuit against the RNC and its chairman to instead be able to vote \"in accordance with the free exercise of their conscience.\" Paul adviser Jesse Benton commented, \"We have nothing to do with it and do not support it.\"\n\nAlso in June, the three remaining states voting in primaries, Utah, Nebraska, and Montana, added the final 101 delegates to attend the Republican National Convention.\n\nJuly\nOn Saturday, July 14, the Nebraska State Republican Convention selected 32 at-large delegates to the Republican National Convention. In addition, three party leaders attend: Nebraska's National Committeeman, Nebraska's National Committeewoman, and chairman of the Nebraska Republican Party, who are unpledged delegates by virtue of their position. The prospective delegates indicated their presidential preference (and were bound to vote for that candidate for the first two ballots at the Republican National Convention). This was the last state Republican convention and Romney garnered support of 30 Nebraska delegates; and Ron Paul, the support of two Nebraska delegates.\n\nAll 2,286 delegates were to be finalized before the vote at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, August 27\u201331.\n\nAugust\n\n 50 states, the District of Columbia, two commonwealths and three territories sent 2,286 delegates to convention.\n The US commonwealths attending were Puerto Rico and Northern Mariana Islands.\n The US territories attending were American Samoa, Guam, and US Virgin Islands.\n\nOn August 11, 2012, Romney announced the selection of Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his vice-presidential running mate. In front of the battleship USS Wisconsin in Virginia, Governor of Virginia Bob McDonnell introduced Romney to make his announcement to a cheering and supportive crowd. The announcement came two weeks before the Republican National Convention and led immediately into a bus tour to battleground states.\n\nRon Paul led a rally in Tampa Bay, Florida, on Sunday, the day before the Republican National Convention was to begin. \"No matter the outcome of the national convention, Constitutional Conservatism will benefit the nation\", a Paul spokesperson said.\n\nLeading into the national convention, preliminary delegate counts {soft, firm} were: Romney{1,545, 1,399}; Paul{173,100}; Santorum{248,251}; Gingrich{142,143}; Others{1,3}; Available{147,63}; and Uncommitted{30,327}. These totals changed as delegates switched their support to Romney or Paul at the convention. A simple majority of 1,144 delegate votes were needed to win nomination.\n\nWithin the first hours of convention, each state declared their delegation vote to the nation\u2014Romney won the nomination with 2,061 delegate votes. Other candidates, including Bachmann, Santorum, and mainly Ron Paul, garnered 202 votes, with 23 delegates abstaining. The Romney-Ryan ticket was formalized.\n\nThe final official votes for the Republican nominees for president and vice president took place at the Republican National Convention in Tampa Bay, Florida\u2014the three-day convention from Tuesday, August 28, to Thursday, August 30. The 2012 Democratic National Convention followed in the first week of September in Charlotte, North Carolina.\n\nSchedule and process\nThe primary elections took place from January 3 to July 14 and allocated and elected 2,286 voting delegates and 2,125 alternate delegates in 56 delegations to the 2012 Republican National Convention in the week of August 27.\n\nThe total base number of delegates allocated to each of the 50 U.S. states is 10 at-large delegates, plus 3 delegates per congressional district. In addition, fixed numbers of at-large delegates are allocated to Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands under the party's delegate selection rules. States are awarded bonus delegates based on the following factors:\n Bonus delegates to each state that cast a majority of their Electoral College votes for the Grand Old Party (GOP) candidate in the 2008 presidential election\n One bonus delegate for each GOP senator\n One bonus delegate to each state that has a GOP majority in their delegation to the House of Representatives\n One bonus delegate for each state that has a GOP governor\n Bonus delegates for majorities in one or all of the chambers in their state legislature.\n\nThe two Republican National Committee members from each state and territory and the chairperson of the state's Republican Party are delegates unless the state is penalized for violating the RNC's scheduling rules. The individual states decide whether these delegates are bound or unbound.\n\nA candidate must have a plurality in five state delegations in order to be on the first ballot at national convention. For the purposes of these primaries, the five territories and D.C. are counted as states (Rule 27). This five-state rule is Rule No. 40 of the rules of the Republican Party as adopted by the 2008 Republican National Convention and amended by the Republican National Committee on August 6, 2010. It is the rule outlining the way the convention will nominate the Republican candidate for president.\n\nThe primary election table below shows how and when the National Convention delegates are allocated and elected. This means it does not include straw polls, primary or other kinds. And it do not include the dates for different local conventions where delegates are already allocated are elected.\n Dates: The first date column is the date of primary or caucuses where the election process for the delegation starts. This event can allocated delegate or let them stay unallocated. But two more dates are important in the process, the date when congressional district delegates are (s)elected and the date when state delegates are (s)elected. Some event stretches for more than one day, if so the date stated in the table is the end day of the event. This is done for technical reasons.\n State Delegation Each delegation are made up of up to three kinds of delegates. Party members, delegates from the congressional districts and delegates from the state at-large. They can either be bound, meaning that they are legally or morally bound to vote for a candidate for at least the first ballot at the National Convention, or they can be unbound, meaning that they are free to vote for any candidate at the National Convention. Some delegates are only morally bound, meaning that they are allocated to a candidate or elected on his ticket but are not legally bound to vote for him. Some delegates are unbound but are elected at their local conventions because they are strong supporters of a candidate. This means that the binding status of a delegate only become of importance if no candidate have reached a majority of delegates before the National Convention. If a candidate suspends his campaign the delegates allocated and/or elected to him may become unbound depending on state rules. Five delegations (#) have been penalized for breaking RNC election guidelines, meaning that their number of delegates have been cut in half and their party leaders have been banned from voting. Ten delegations (\u2020) have chosen to bind their party leaders to the result of the allocating event instead of leaving them unbound.\n\n Allocation: Delegates can either be allocated or unallocated at the starting primary or caucuses. The contests that allocated delegates on state and district levels uses following allocating systems:\n Winner-take-all. The candidate receiving the most votes are allocated all the delegates.\n Proportional. Most states that allocated proportionally have thresholds ranging from 10 to 25 percent of the vote.\n Election All delegates allocated as unallocated are (s)elected. In the race to get a majority of the delegates the events electing unallocated delegates naturally receive most attention. The methods are:\n Convention. Except from Wyoming county conventions all these conventions are at the state and district level.\n Direct election. Instead of voting for a candidate at the primary or caucuses the voters elect the delegates directly. The delegates can state their presidential preference and in that way be elected on a candidates \"ticket\"\n Slate. Before the primary or caucuses each candidate submits a slate with prospective delegates. The allocated delegates are then selected from these slates.\n Committee. The state GOP executive committee or its chairman selects the delegates.\n Secured delegates: These columns do not list the 117 unbound RNC delegates that are not a part of the primary election process. Five candidates secured delegates, they are listed in a candidates' column when they are allocated to him or when they after or at their election have pledge to him. Huntsman's (the fifth candidate) two New Hampshire delegates are listed as uncommitted. These are numbers that the candidates have actually secured for themselves, not projected counts or counts after a candidate has suspended his campaign and released his candidates. The uncommitted column (last) lists both elected delegates that are still uncommitted and unallocated delegates.\nThis is a sortable table \u2014 links provide quick paths to more information on the different state primaries:\n By clicking on the link in the 'State' column you will go to the state or territory article.\n By clicking on the link in the 'Contest' column you will go to the state or territory primary or caucuses article.\n Click the triangles to sort any column.

The initial iteration of the Silent Barn, an underground performance space, opened in 2006 in Ridgewood, Queens. The Silent Barn collective relocated to a new space in Bushwick, Brooklyn in 2012. The Silent Barn closed its Bushwick location in April 2018, citing financial difficulties and individual burnout as reasons for closing the space.\n\nHistory \nThe Silent Barn collective had its roots in a building at 915 Wyckoff Ave., in Ridgewood, Queens. Beginning in 2006, an ever-shifting group of artists, musicians, and organizers hosted live performances in their kitchen and basement, eventually coalescing around a group of core collaborators. The basement also housed the video-game collective Babycastles.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, the Queens location was closed by a city agency and subsequently vandalized and robbed while the residents were locked out. Shortly after, a team of folks involved in the Silent Barn community collectivized and developed a plan to find a new space and create a legal, above-ground all-ages art space. They launched a Kickstarter campaign on July 20, 2011, and raised over $40,000.\n\nFor a year and a half, the Silent Barn maintained no physical space. It established itself as an organization and held several public meetings, where the community discussed sustainability and DIY, brainstorming for the future.\n\nSilent Barn's Bushwick location opened in December 2012. The three-story space housed a live performance venue with a cafe/bar; visual art project spaces Disclaimer Gallery and Casa Experimental; and Vital Joint, home of the Title:Point theater company; along with more than a dozen artists' studios, including Gravesend Recordings, Double Double Whammy and Aftermath Supplies. The top two floors of the building housed a four-apartment artists' residency program, with periodic open calls for new members. \n\nThe Silent Barn Bushwick location closed at the end of April in 2018. The closing was announced through a message from the collective that claimed they would close the space because of how hard it was to raise money for rent. The collective mentioned the challenges of gentrification and keeping the venue insured after an accidental fire added to normal difficulties of operating such a large venue. The Silent Barn collective tried to help their tenants and groups that used their space to find new homes; they particularly tried to find a new base and funding for the Educated Little Monsters group that regularly met at the Silent Barn.\n\nOrganization \nThe Silent Barn was run by a collective of volunteers, who organize using non-hierarchical, consensus-based tools. Silent Barn was a not-for-profit project, though the Silent Barn's finances were administered by a private company, Paesthetics, LLC. The members of Paesthetics are all collective members, and were also named on the building's ten-year lease. Major decisions were discussed in the Kitchen, the organization's collective governing body, which was open to all members.\n\nSilent Barn makes use of an informal lexicon based on cooking metaphors. Members of the Kitchen collective were known as \"chefs\". The Kitchen was guided by a living document known as the Cookbook.\n\nThe Silent Barn maintained a policy against corporate sponsorship of its space and its events and a safer spaces policy.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Silent Barn\n\nMusic venues in Brooklyn\nAmerican artist groups and collectives", "Arlene Stadd was an American television writer and playwright.\n\nStadd married writer Leonard Stadd in 1950.

He appointed Attorney Expiridion Laxa to serve as the Chairman of the film festival which starts on June 14 and culminates on June 24, Manila's birthday. In addition, in an effort to promote Philippine films, Antonio Villegas banned the showing of foreign films at movie houses during the Manila Film Festival from June 14 through June 24. Furthermore, in order to instill national pride and prevent vagrants from sleeping in movie theaters, Villegas started the tradition of playing the national anthem at the beginning of each film showings. Despite criticism from smokers and cigarette manufacturers, Villegas was adamant in banning smoking from movie theaters. In that effort, he delivered his poetic verse which is displayed on movie screens right after the national anthem. It reads: \"Hindi po nais namin kayo'ng pigilin, pero ang usok ay masamang hangin.\" This translates to \"Not that we wish to restrain you, but smoke is foul air (stench).\"\n\nMost of the first batch of the festival films came up with English titles.

Additionally, at the beginning of her career, Gruner began making short films and video performances that she recorded using a Super 8 camera. Her work is said to be heavily influenced by second wave feminism and post conceptual work, which caused critical debate in Mexico during the 1990s. Gruner's art is unique and personal as she bases many of her pieces on her own personal experiences and culture. In addition, she explores these different ideas of nationality, identity, and feminism through many different mediums. She experiments a lot with film, photography, performance, and interactive art installations in order to appeal to a mass audience. Silvia Gruner is recognized as one of the most original artists of her time in Latin America and is praised for having created a new vocabulary in Mexican contemporary art.\n\nWorks\n\nLa mitad del Camino/The Middle of the Road, 1994\nGruner wanted to create art directly on a part of the border fence that ran between the Colonia Libertad in Tijuana and San Diego. In this art instillation she installed more than 100 small figures of the Aztec goddess, Tlazolt\u00e9otl. The goddess is seen as a symbol of fertility and motherhood, hence why Gruner crafted the goddess in a position of giving birth. It is left up to interpretation as to what Tlazolt\u00e9otl, is supposed to signify here at the border as some believe it signifies rebirth and it meant to be comforting to illegal immigrants and a symbol of reassurance that those migrating will not forget their roots and culture. However, others believe that since Tlazolt\u00e9otl is stuck on the border in the middle of childbirth, it can also raise a feeling of uncertainty during this significant transitional period where you are between the know and unknown.\n\nDon't fuck with the past, you might get pregnant, 1994\nGruner created an installation with a series of 16 photographic prints that depict small clay figures. Each Ektacolor (chromogenic development) print measures 20x24 inches and brings the overall installation to a size of 108x96 inches. She continues to explore the theme of time in this piece and its close entanglement with Mexican culture. She explains how in the Mexican culture people are taught to look at the past in a conservative way and uses this work to address the parallel between culture and different Mexican taboos. She not only challenges this taboo but counters gender binaries by using this piece to deal with the masculine and the feminine simultaneously. In addition, Gruner purposely enters these images with a disruptive attitude in order to powerfully inhabit this unknown territory. Through the use of everyday objects she demonstrates how this piece is deeply rooted in the Mexican culture and shows not only their history but the people themselves within the art.\n\nHow to look at Mexican Art, 1995\nIn How to look at Mexican Art , Gruner pictures her fingers through a punctured molcajete on top of a piece of bright red plastic. A molcajete is a stone tool used to grind different items and are typically associated with indigenous Mexican culture. Molcajetes remain popular today as they are used throughout Latin America to grind different foods. In the photographic diptych, the first picture shows her grasping the molcajete from the top and then moves to put her fingers through the hole from the bottom. Through the use of incorporating her own body in her art it shows how personal this piece is and how she is challenging her culture and Mexican heritage. Additionally, the molcajete contrasts against the bright red plastic can be seen as a contrast between the past and the modern present. The molcajete is also very significant and personal in this piece as it belonged to Gruner's childhood nana, or nursemaid which shows how it has been used by various women and is full of tradition. The ambiguity in this piece is meant to leave viewers with the expectations of typical 'Mexican Art'.\n\nCentinela (Sentinel), 2007\nCentinela is a video in which the artist has her head shaved from recent cancer treatments and stands in front of a modernist fountain created by Mathias Goeritz, Ricardo Legorreta, and Isamu Noguchi. Gruner explains how in this piece nothing really happens but simultaneously everything happens. In the video, the subject remains still, completely immobile yet everything in her surroundings continue. The water continues to thrust back and forth, the cars continue to pass by, the environment is dynamic. Once again, through the inclusion of herself in her own work it shows how Gruner explores her own personal life and in this case deals with the emotions of her battle with cancer. Additionally, the title 'Sentinel' refers to a soldier who stands to keep watch as she is doing in the video.\n\nHemisferios/Hemispheres, 2016\nSilvia Gruner's work Hemispheres was aimed to introduce Gruner's work to New York's audience, and explores the dichotomy between the personal and collective. It is an installation of a series of her work and a video interview but the main piece takes place in the garden. This exhibition contains an arrangement of bright red thread, spread throughout two gardens. The piece is meant to exhibit Gruner's brain and the different thoughts and ideas being dispersed throughout the space. Her goal was to express the complexity of thoughts and feelings, in a world so complicated. It is representative of how everything in her life is connected yet it constructed by different fragments. The exhibition highlights her works such as The films Sand (1986) and Sentinel (2007), How to Look at Mexican Art (1995), Bauhaus for Monkeys (2011), and 500 kilos of Impotence (or possibility) (1998). Overall, the exhibition is meant to highlight over 30 years of her work and the dichotomies between a \"psychological and subjective dimension, and a political and cultural one.\"\n\nHonors and awards \n Grants & Commissions Award from CIFO (2015)\n Fondo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes- FONCA (Mexico, 2012\u20132015, 2008\u20132011, 2002\u20132005, 1999\u20132002)\n Apoyo del FONCA para Proyectos Especiales y Coinversiones Culturales, Mexico (1993-1994)\n Rockefeller MacArthur Film, Video and Multimedia Fellowship (1999-2000)\n FONCA scholarship (Mexico, 1990\u20131991)\n MFA with honors, Massachusetts College of Art, Boston, MA (1986)\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n \n arte, vida y contexto III\n Silvia Gruner | Hammer Museum\n Feb 20: Silvia Gruner in conversation with Tarek Elhaik | Arts Research Center\n \n https://ashadedviewonfashion.com/2016/02/25/hemispheres-labyrinth-sketchbook-silvia-gruner-americas-society-nyc-february-24th-june-18-2016/\n\n1959 births\nLiving people\nPeople from Mexico City\nMassachusetts College of Art and Design alumni\nBezalel Academy of Arts and Design alumni\n20th-century Mexican sculptors\n21st-century Mexican sculptors\nMexican performance artists\nMexican video artists\nMexican Jews\n20th-century Mexican women artists\n21st-century Mexican women artists", "Genesis Lourdes Rodriguez Gomez (born 17 July 1994) is a Venezuelan weightlifter, competing in the 53 kg category and representing Venezuela at international competitions.\n\nShe competed at world championships, including at the 2015 World Weightlifting Championships.\n\nShe won the silver medal in her event at the 2022 South American Games held in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay.\n\nMajor results\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n1994 births\nLiving people\nVenezuelan female weightlifters\nPlace of birth missing (living people)\nWeightlifters at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics\nWeightlifters at the 2015 Pan American Games\nPan American Games medalists in weightlifting\nPan American Games gold medalists for Venezuela\nPan American Games silver medalists for Venezuela\nWeightlifters at the 2019 Pan American Games\nMedalists at the 2015 Pan American Games\nMedalists at the 2019 Pan American Games\nPan American Weightlifting Championships medalists\n21st-century Venezuelan women\nSouth American Games silver medalists for Venezuela\nSouth American Games medalists in weightlifting\nCompetitors at the 2022 South American Games", "Canale Villoresi is a canal in Italy; it was the brainchild of Lombardy engineer Eugenio Villoresi.\n\nIt originates from the River Ticino near the village of Somma Lombardo, and runs eastwards for  to the Adda River.\n\nConstruction began in 1877, but Villoresi himself died two years later.

This was described as a \"spam campaign\" and raised a great deal of criticism.\n\nAddress book harvesting\nThe automatic invitation of all the contacts in the e-mail address books of people who signed up to their service was controversial for two reasons:\n\n Without explaining intentions, Quechup required permission to access the address book.\n Invites were sent to all addresses in address books without permission of e-mail address owners.\n\nThis attracted a great deal of criticism in September 2007.\n\nReacting to the criticism, Quechup's parent company iDate Corporation made a public statement on 17 September 2007, stating that:\n\nMuch of the criticism focused on misleading users by hiding the nature of the feature in the 'small print' of the site terms and not specifying it in the Quechup privacy policy, which stated only, \"You agree that we may use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyse site usage, improve our content and product offerings, and customize our Site's content, layout, and services.\".\n\nWhile admitting the campaign was misleading, technology blogger Chris Hambly pointed out that text explaining how the feature worked was placed in normal print directly above the feature, raising the question of a user's responsibility to read what they agree to, although he noted that this explanatory text failed to clearly state what would happen. \n\nIn their 17 September statement, Glen Finch, Chief Technology Officer stated \n\nThis has raised the issue of users automatically 'opting in' without first understanding what they are accepting, rather than automatically 'opting out' of questionable features.\n\nResponse\nQuechup responded by changing how it operated its service and belatedly reassuring customers it was not acting maliciously, even if irresponsibly.\n\n Quechup changed how its address book check worked within days, clearly giving members the option of which contacts, if any, they wanted to invite.\n Quechup adopted Windows Live ID Delegated Authentication, enabling Live and Hotmail users to grant limited access by logging in directly on Microsoft's secure servers.\n Quechup is a member of SenderScore the world's most comprehensive database of email sender reputation.\n Quechup fully complies with Microsoft's Sender ID Framework for email authentication and uses SPF records.\n\nThe Quechup affair encouraged calls for open authentication through an OpenID system such as Yahoo's BBauth, which would allow a user to grant limited access to their data, without providing passwords directly to a website. Indeed, Quechup adopted Windows Live ID Delegated Authentication, an OpenID system for Windows Live and Hotmail users.\n\nFake invitations\nIn a more recent development, technology journalist Robert X. Cringely raised the possibility that Quechup may be sending fake dating invitations to subscribers that attempts to get them to sign up to a premium service. In his article, Cringely stated that it was not certain if these fake e-mails were the work of what he called a \"rogue Quechup affiliate who gets a commission for sign ups\" or a more sophisticated automatic spam operation.\n\nSee also\nViral marketing\nSocial networking spam\nForum spam\nBlog spam\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n Quechup is rotten: don't accept invites \u2013 An article on Boing Boing.\n Quechup?

The single was released digitally to digital stores and radio stations on August 26, 2008. A music video was released on the same day.\n\nA limited physical version of the single was released on 7\" vinyl and can be obtained exclusively by pre-ordering Appeal to Reason. This version also includes a B-side titled \"Minor Threat\", which is a cover of the eponymous song by Minor Threat.\n\nThe single's fifth week on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart made \"Re-Education (Through Labor)\" Rise Against's second-highest charting single to date, hitting number five. It has since reached a peak of number three.  The band's previous highest charting single on the Alternative Songs chart was \"The Good Left Undone\", the third single from the band's previous album, which peaked at number 6. \"Re-Education (Through Labor)\" is also Rise Against's first song to appear on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart.\n\nRecording and composition\n\"Re-Education (Through Labor)\" was written  Rise Against, with lyrics by lead vocalist Tim McIlrath, and produced by Bill Stevenson and Jason Livermore. Stevenson and Livermore engineered the song with Andrew Berlin, while Chris Lord-Alge assisted as the mixer. It was recorded at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado and was mastered by Ted Jensen. Rise Against released the song as the Appeal to Reason first single on August 25, 2008.\n\n\"Re-Education (Through Labor)\" is a rock song that opens with a heavy metal guitar riff. John Hanson of Sputnikmusic commented that \"Re-Education (Through Labor)\" sounds similar to another Rise Against song, \"Ready to Fall\". Lyrically, it is noted for being one of more politically motivated tracks from Appeal to Reason. According to McIlrath, the lyrics are about \"the 9-to-5, dog-eat-dog lifestyle, and what we are asked to do to simply make ends meet nowadays\". Some music journalists have also discussed the song's meaning, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic writing that the lyrics \"strike out against the slow dumbing down of America\", while Aaron Burgess of The A.V. Club asserted that the song accuses United States President George W. Bush of fascism.\n\nMusic video\nReleased on September 22, 2008, the song's music video was directed by Kevin Kerslake (Faith No More, Green Day), filmed in the band's home city of Chicago and features members of the Chicago branch of the Moped Army and their mopeds. The video begins with a quote from President John F. Kennedy: \"Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.\"  It frequently switches between scenes of the band playing in the basement of an abandoned cinema and an army of moped riders. The group drives around Chicago and drops backpacks, presumably bombs, in various locations.  The closing scene shows the row of moped riders watching the city burn in the night after the bombs have detonated.\n\nMcIlrath admitted that the music video is slightly political, in a way that makes it universally relatable. He explained, \"One of the great things about doing a video is that your imagination is the only thing that's limiting you, so you can do anything. So we have a video that's going to encompass the anger and the angst that the youth of America feel toward society at large and the things that are demanded of them.\"\n\nThere is another version of this video, with informative statistics on subjects such as deforestation, the death of children, and others.  This version is called \"uncensored\", because the original video does not show any of this information.\n\nTrack listing\n\nCharts\n\nCertifications\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n \n\nRise Against songs\n2008 singles\nProtest songs\nPolitical songs\nSongs written by Tim McIlrath\nSongs written by Joe Principe\nSongs written by Brandon Barnes\nSongs written by Zach Blair\n2008 songs\nDGC Records singles\nInterscope Records singles", "Coptopterina is a genus of beetles in the family Carabidae, containing the following species:\n\n Coptopterina johnstoni (Alluaud, 1917)\n Coptopterina limbipennis (G.

Original line-up is the following:\n drums (Y\u00fcla Slipobitch)\n bass (Wladimir Ohrelianov II)\n two guitars\n keyboards\n vocals\n\n2000\nThe line-up is taken back from scratch, only  Wladimir Ohrelianov II and Y\u00fcla Slipobitch go on. New guitar player Ant\u00f2n Pinokiov and keyboard player Alter Frabrovitch join the band. There is no singer.\n\nThe band records its first demo called Ma K\u00ebt I, which contains Bienvenue \u00e0 Babylone and Pinok'\u00efo.\n\n2002\nA horn section joins Sebkha-Chott with Marx Bronosov on trombone and Labial Aerostick on alto saxophone. The band records a second demo called La L\u00e9gende de l'ElectroM\u00e9nager which contains 4 tracks: Manuel, Bienvenue \u00e0 Babylone, La Descente de Frabrot le Vieil and Carpe Diem. Latin influences might be heard, especially in rhythm section, while the arrival of horns gives a jazz-funk/fusion touch to this album, turning Sebkha-Chott in a less metal band. First shows are performed by that period.\n\nHorn section is enlarged with a trumpet played by Comte Benito Del Amafia.\n\n2002/2003\nSebkha-Chott's first singer, Mustach'Man, joins the band, charismatic character who is going to lead the band in a theatrical way of performing shows. Mustach'Man will enter several characters in a single show. From this moment on, Sebkha-Chott's shows take the shape of burlesque theater, deploying the universe of an absurd dictatorship, led by a Joke Tyrant. This change is essential, as it's the beginning of the systematical use of mythological characters in every actions of Sebkha-Chott.\n\nThe album De l'Existence de la Mythologie Chottienne en 7 Cycles is recorded during 2002/2003, and is released at Autumn 2004, without any distribution at first. This album is distributed by Musea Records since 2006, under Musea Parall\u00e8le label.\n\nVedior Bis joins Sebkha-Chott as a sophisticated narrator.\n\nDuring this recording session, comte Benito Del Amafia is replaced by Cristobal Del Amafia. They will play together in a unique show to Frank Zappa.\n\n2004\n De l'Existence de la Mythologie Chottienne en 7 Cycles is released.\n Ant\u00f2n Pinokiov leaves the band and is replaced by MerouMan.\n Horn section leaves Sebkha-Chott and is replaced by Comte P.A.Squale Del Amafia on alto and soprano saxophones, \n Tzom Tr\u00fcmb becomes Sebkha-Chott's trombone player shortly before P.A. Squale Del Amafia leaves the band.\n\n2005\nMustach'Man leaves the band to enter a new chanson project called La Muette. He's replaced by Hrabe Black Sebbath (vocals) and Comtesse Gnania Del Amafia (vocals).\nElectronic Machines are integrated as Siphon Trounez\u00f6hle (machines) takes place in the band.\nShortly before summer, MerouMan announce he will leave soon, and Capt'n Roses (guitar) replaces him. Both of them will play together on Nagah Mahdi.\nNagah Mahdi's recording session is done during summer 2005, in MJC Plaine du Ronceray. For this purpose, Labial Aerostick, P.A.Squale Del Amafia et Mustach'Man reintegers the band, as well as many guests: Gr\u00fcmse (vocals - Electro Addict Band), Arno (vocals - Carnival in Coal), Petit Zornbergette (tap dance - Mentat Routage), David Rabillet (cajon), Mimetic Angel (vocals), Guilty (turntables - Anes et Bateaux / DJ Guilty), Jules Lefranc Gaulois Ka\u00efser (percussions), VaGoDor Deu Sahpun (baritone saxophone), GenBaku (sound painting).\n\nAfter a computer crash, part of the recording is lost. New recording sessions are made in October 2005. Release dare is rescheduled.\n\nAlter Frabrovitch is replaced by Beno\u00eet Popol II on keyboards.\nVaGoDor Deu Sahpun joins Sebkha-Chott on baritone saxophone, and Jules Lefranc Gaulois Ka\u00efser does the same on percussions.\n\n2006\nHrabe Black Sebbath leaves the band ; Wladimir Ohrelianov II, Beno\u00eet Popol II and Capt'n'Roses take the male vocals part.\nNagah Mahdi - Opuscrits en 48 Rouleaux is released on Musea Parall\u00e8le, giving to Sebkha-Chott international visibility. De l'Existence de la Mythologie Chottienne en 7 Cycles is distributed by the same label from that date on.\nNagah Mahdi'reviews are success, especially in the progressive rock ring.\n\nComtesse Del Amafia leaves Sebkha-Chott.\n\n2007\nSebkha-Chott launches its first thematic tour, called Op\u00e9ration Coin Coin. They meet Sleepytime Gorilla Museum twice at this occasion. This meeting is of great importance concerning the future orientations of Sebkha-Chott.\n\n2008\nDuring summer, Sebkha-Chott simultaneously records [[Nigla[h] - Tapisseries Finex en XXX Strips et LXX/X Trompettes|Nigla[h]]] and De la Persistance onboard of P\u00e9niche Excelsior on the AMMD's studio.\nAt the end of this recording sessions, Beno\u00eet Popol II and Jules LeFranc Gaulois Ka\u00efser leaves the band. Keyboard will be shared by Wladimir Ohrelianov II and Tzom Tr\u00fcmb (through a MIDI vibe), and percussions will be played by Y\u00fcla Slipobitch mainly.\n\nOn 30 October, [[Nigla[h] - Tapisseries fines en XXX Strips et LXX/X Trompettes]] is released on Musea Records. This album sets a turning point by being much more dark and obscure than the previous ones, Sleepytime Gorilla Museum's being clearly hearable.\n\nThe band tours in Europe with Canadian band Unexpect to support the album. After this tour, Capt'n'Roses leaves the band. Sebkha-Chott enters a doubt period.\n\nLe groupe tourne en Europe en compagnie des Canadiens d'Unexpect pour d\u00e9fendre l'album. Suite \u00e0 cette tourn\u00e9e, Capt'n Roses fait savoir qu'il quitte le groupe. Sebkha-Chott se retrouve alors dans une p\u00e9riode de doute.\n\n2009\nDuring this period, some choices are made, VaGoDor Deu Sahpun and Siphon Trounez\u00f6hle leave the band.\n\nWladimir Ohrelianov II and Y\u00fcla Slipobitch d\u00e9cide to go on by integrating electronic machines in an intensive way, which is a historic will of the band, never made real due to lack of time.\n\nDe la Persistance de la Mythologie Chottienne en ??? V\u00e9los is released on Musea Records.\n\nTzom Tr\u00fcmb leaves the band as Souv Ponky Ponk joins it on saxophone and lights management altogether with Cousin Sub on guitar and audioproduction. The shape is then double semi-quatuor, first half being on stage (Wladimir Ohrelianov II and Y\u00fcla Slipobitch) the other half being at FOH (Cousin Sub and Souv Ponky Ponk).\n\nMainly, this year is spent by setting up the new show and the machines/lights/VJing synchronization system. This system is based on free software only.\n\nDuring summer, Cousin Sub leaves guitar and keeps only audio production. Wladimir Ohrelianov II takes the guitar added to the bass. Souv Ponky Ponk leaves FOH to get on stage.\n\n2010\nSebkha-Chott goes back on tour, and cross road with Extra Life, another important meeting, which let the band even more sure about the new way he works sound as a global material.\n\nDuring Summer, Sebkha-Chott plays at Zappanale, a German festival in celebration of Frank Zappa, sharing the line-up with Napoleon Murphy Brock, Robert Martin, Ike Willis...\n\nFrom this tour, it appears that the technical setup is a bit too complex to prepare on stage ; the band goes back working on it to make it easier to use.\n\n[[Ne[XXX]t Epilog]] recording sessions begin during Winter.\n\n2011\nThis year is mainly spent mixing the Ne[XXX]t Epilog and building new parts of the setup.\n\nA new character appears: Tupac Promo, a character destined to communicate in Moron Languages with terrestrial people.\n\n2012\n\nCousin Sub leaves Sebkha-Chott.\n\nOn Spring, Sebkha-Chott starts a new tour called The Ne[XXX]t Tour.\n\nNe[XXX]t Epilog v1.0 is physically released 2012, September the 22nd on AMMD / Musea Records / Dogmazic.

Sebkha-Chott, currently named Sebkha-Chott Kourt, is a bunch of characters coming from a mythology invented by the band. This mythology is the only way the band communicates and appears through, as far as shows, web, interviews or even CDs are concerned.\n\nThe band calls this mythology Chottian Mythology or Ohrelander mythology\n\nUniverse\nThe Universe Sebkha-Chott's mythology is based on is an autocratic, violent and absurd universe. It lays on a set of locations/places, characters and concepts, several being well-documented, other being hard to comprehend. Absurd and non-sense humor are constants in this mythology, which sometimes forgets to precise it.\n\nOhreland\nOhreland is the country Sebkha-Chott's Kourt lives in. It is a strolling world, which has no contact with Earth, except during Sebkha-Chott's shows (called \"stopovers\" by the band).\n\nPolitical system is a dictatorship longing since 10000 years (this duration does not change with time passing), with a unique tyrant: Wladimir Ohrelianov II.\n\nOn a topological point of view, Ohreland is a piece of terrestrial rock with a V8 motor. There are representations of Ohreland in every albums of the band, always from a quite far point of view. It seems that Ohreland is the mix between an organic part (roots) at his base, and an extremely urbanized zone (numerous buildings) on his high parts.\n\nMembers of Sebkha-Chott have explained that this world has been thought like a crossing point between Le Roi et l'Oiseau (Paul Grimault and Jacques Pr\u00e9vert), La R\u00e9volte \u00e0 deux sous (Bernard Clavel) and several towns of Final Fantasy, en particulier les \u00e9ditions VI, VII et VIII:\na crappy downtown, deep into dust, without light, full of poor people,\na luxurious hightown, techno\u00efd, open to a small number of people (Sebkha-Chott's Kourt) only,\na mix between Middle-Age architectures and high-tech object.\n\nIts main city is Babylone, though there is no other Ohrelander town known. Sometimes Ohreland is presented as a city itself.\n\nCharacters\nOhreland's population is split into three parts (recently, mainly two):\n the elite, currently called Sebkha-Chott's Kourt (Kourt is a reference to the hip hop notion of Crew or Krew applied to French phonetics and mixed with royal semantic) - every members of Sebkha-Chott except Mustach'Man and Hrabe Black Sebbath did belong to Sebkha-Chott's Kourt,\n people, about who there is almost no information: their number is not known precisely (several billions are what comes the most often in the Tyrant's words, though it's not possible due to the small size of Ohreland), as well as the demographic repartition (the Tyrant recently told that Ohrelanders were 9999 years old) - people are interpreted by the audience in every Sebkha-Chott's appearance (shows, web, interviews, CDs...),\n the resistance network, composed by Mustach'Man firstly, and then by Hrabe Black Sebbath, which are the Tyrant's opponents. Since the leaving of Hrabe Black Sebbath, there is no more resistance network in Ohreland.\n\nSebkha-Chott's Kourt\nIt actually contains:\n Wladimir Ohrelianov II: Ohreland's Tyrant since 10000 years ; it's an angry and pretentious character, loving to lose himself in everlasting improvised speeches, sometimes congratulating the audience (early times of the shows), sometimes really threatening (middle and end of shows). Wladimir Ohrelianov II's speeches use high-level vocabulary, despite the presence of brutal mood changes and several slang words and expressions.\n Y\u00fcla Slipobitch a.k.a Missy Phillis: prostitute in Ohreland since 10000 years, she also is Ohrelander army's leader. She's a power-girl, feminist, though really keen on every human delights, which might turn her into a perfect stupid girl. She almost doesn't speak, and actually only shouts. On very rare occasions, she might have been heard speaking in an intelligible French (last track of Nagah Mahdi - Opuscrits en 48 Rouleaux, in Ode L\u00e9tale and on several communication clips of Sebkha-Chott).\n Souv Ponky Ponk alias Souvenette Sire Sh\u00f4-De: Tyrant's factotum, he's the Occulocks MasterChief, which are the Tyrant's bodyguard as well as a milicia destined to people oppression. He also acts as an executioner during the shows. The hierarchy between Souv Ponky Ponk and Y\u00fcla Slipobitch is not firmly established, and sometimes changes. He's unable to use words and seems completely stupid, though absolutely faithful towards the Tyrant.\n Tupac Promo: he's the communication channel of Ohreland. He's a puppet on a string manipulated by Souv Ponky Ponk. Originally named Didier, he was re-called Tupac Promo in celebration of Tupac Shakur. Tupac Promo signs almost all moron-languages-communications of Sebkha-Chott (which means language with less high-level vocabulary and less link to Ohrelander mythology's dedicated semantic), and sometimes opens the shows.\n\nOhrelander Gods\nIn the GangbangoGenesis of Ohreland by Sebkha-Chott, one might read that several Gods have given Ohreland to Wladimir Ohrelianov II. Though, in Ohrelander mythology, there is only one God: Yvette H., Goddess of Death Musette Yvette firstly, and then of Mekanik Metal Disco. Her name is always followed by the assertion \"Lou\u00e9s soient son dentiste et son coiffeur\" (God bless her dentist and her hairdresser). There are some representations of Yvette H. on old posters of the band and she often speaks on Sebkha-Chott's website, which she created.\n\nOhrelander graves\nSebkha-Chott ex-members (called \"deads\" by Sebkha-Chott's Kourt) had the following roles to play:\n Lahfass Karcher : occulock\n Cousin Sub : occulock\n Tzom Tr\u00fcmb : milicia masterchief\n Siphon Trounez\u00f6hle : scientist\n VaGoDor Deu Sahpun : venusian albinos rastafar\u00ef\n Capt'n'Roses : pirate\n Beno\u00eet Popol II : ohrelander pope\n Jules LeFranc Gaulois Ka\u00efser : Y\u00fcla Slipobitch's pimp\n Comtesse Gnania Del Amafia : ohrelander aristocrat\n Hrabe Black Sebbath : resistant vampire\n Alter Frabrovitch : army's leader\n MerouMan : sea super hero\n Mustach'Man : proteiform resistant\n Comte P.A.Squale Del Amafia : aristocrat\n Ant\u00f2n Pinokiov : puppet on a string\n Comte Benito Del Amafia : aristocrat\n Filleul Cristobal Del Amafia : aristocrat\n Marx Bonosov : joke maker\n Labial Aerostick : televangelist\n Vedior Bis : narrator\n\nConcepts and political engagements\nOhrelander mythology, characters, Tyrant's speeches and reactions of other characters are all means to communicate several concepts and political messages that members of Sebkha-Chott want to share, through absurdity and ab absrubio demonstrations. In particular, Ohrelander mythology supports:\n vegetarism (and  antispecism in general), all Sebkha-Chott's Kourt characters are vegetarians ;\n feminism (especially porn-feminism or pro-sex feminism),through Y\u00fcla Slipobitch, mainly, but also through several reference objects (Two-fingers Holy Hand Trinity) ;\n ecology: several times, Wladimir Ohrelianov II spoke about using dry toilets in Ohreland, and also clean-propulsion systems (bathroom-nuclearo-plastico physics, which is an ironic reference to nuclear physics and its self-proclamated security), the idea of turning the audience into compost also has been proposed in concert ;\n anarchism, with numerous attacks towards democraty as a system reproducing jungle law in a social manner.\n\nLive Show Experiences \nSebkha-Chott's shows are the very moment in which Ohreland exists. In each concert, a hierarchy is established between Sebkha-Chott's Kourt and the audience (which takes the role of the people).\n\nThe atmosphere in Sebkha-Chott's show is quite particular: the absurd basement is such that the content might not be taken seriously, though, the audience solicitation is so strong (especially when the audience doesn't react spontaneously) that kind of an embarrassment or even mistrust might occur. Whatever might be the audience reactions, Sebkha-Chott's Kourt lays on them to build the show. Each concert thus is a unique event, as neither the setlist, nor the speeches are defined by advance. Still, there are some never-changing things: the shows open on a triumphal incoming of the Kourt (since 2007), which quickly leads to Tyrant's speech, and they end up on the death of every member of Sebkah-Chott's Kourt, killed by the Tyrant, mainly.\n\nDiscography\n\nAlbums\n\nDe l'Existence de la Mythologie Chottienne en 7 Cycles\n release date : 2004 - sold out\n Production : AMMD\n Distribution (worldwide) : Musea Records\n Artwork : Slip\n Recording : Sebkha-Chott\n Mix/Mastering : Pascal Berthault (AMS)\n Line-up :\n Y\u00fcla Slipobitch : Drums/Vocals\n Wladimir Ohrelianov II : Bass/Machines/Speech/Vocals\n Alter Frabrovitch : Keyboards/Theater\n Anton Pinokiov : Guitars\n Labial Aerostick : Saxophones\n Marx Bronosov : Trombone\n Cristobal Del Amafia : Trompette\n Mustach'Man : Vocals\n Track list :\n Pinok'\u00efo\n Pour le Comte Del Amafia\n Le Cirque des Enfers\n Carpe Diem\n Bienvenue \u00e0 Babylone\n Manuel\n La Chute d'Ohreland\n\nNagah Mahdi - Opuscrits en 48 Rouleaux\n Release date: 2006 - second edition in 2008\n Production: AMMD\n Distribution (worldwide): Musea Records\n Artwork: Slip\n Recording/Mix: Pascal Berthault (AMS)\n Mastering: Rapha\u00ebl Jaunin (Dyam)\n Line-up:\n Y\u00fcla Slipobitch: Drums\n Wladimir Ohrelianov II: Bass/Speech/Guitars\n Alter Frabrovitch: Keyboards/Clarinet\n Capt'n Roses: Guitars\n Labial Aerostick: Alto saxophone\n P.A.Squale Del Amafia: Soprano saxophone\n VaGoDor Deu Sahpun: Baritone saxophone\n Tzom Tr\u00fcmb: Trombone\n Hrabe Black Sebbath: Vocals\n Gnania Del Amafia: Vocals\n Mimetic Archangel: Vocals\n Arno Strobl (Carnival In Coal): Vocals\n Gr\u00fcmse (Electro Addict Band): Vocals\n Petite Zornberguette (Mentat Routage): Claquettes\n Jules LeFranc Gaulois Ka\u00efser: Percussions\n David Rabillet: Cajon\n Track list:\nThe album is split in a 48 pieces track list, every piece called with a bay or beach name, in reference to Dead Sea Scrolls.\n Concept:\nNagah Mahdi means, in Arabic language, the Prophet sources (or origines). The words Opuscrits and Rouleaux (French word for scrolls) are chosen in reference to the Dead Sea Scrolls. Mostly, all the concepts on which this album lays, are inspired by part of the visions of Horselover Fat in Philip K. Dick's novel VALIS, especially some confusions between Nag Hammadi (homophonic to Nagah Mahdi in French pronunciation) and Qumran caves.\nThis bunch of sources related one with the others, but not strictly linked, leads to a nebulous and abstractive concept, hard to explain clearly.\nAll following albums of Sebkha-Chott will use the same kind of nebulous concepts.\n\nNigla[h] - Tapisseries Fines en XXX Strips et LXX/X Trompettes\n Release Date: 2008\n Production: AMMD\n Distribution (worldwide): Musea Records\n Artwork: Slip + Tzom Tr\u00fcmb + Gr\u00fcmse\n Recording/Mix/Mastering: Cousin Sub\n Line-up:\n Y\u00fcla Slipobitch: Drums/Percussions\n Wladimir Ohrelianov II: Drums/Speech/Vocals/Classical guitar\n Beno\u00eet Popol II: Keyboards/Vocals\n Capt'n Roses: Guitars\n Matthieu Metzger (Anthurus d'Archer, Nasal Retentive Orchestra, Louis Sclavis, Marc Ducret Big Band): Alto and sopranino saxophones\n C\u00e9dric Thimon (Z\u00e9phyrologie, Gl\u00fcck): Soprano saxophone\n VaGoDor Deu Sahpun: Baritone saxophone\n Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Gastard (Campagnie des Musique \u00e0 Ou\u00efr, Melosolex, Journal Intime): Bass saxophone\n Tzom Tr\u00fcmb: Trombone\n ???: Trombone\n Geoffroy: Bass trombone\n Tergal: Bass horn\n Simon Fleury (City Weezle): Vocals\n Def (Enhuma, Valse Noot): Vocals\n Gnania Del Amafia: Vocals\n Emmanuelle Renault: Vocals\n Matthias Deschang: Vibraphone\n Zonder Munster (Gebanku Orchestra, Zonder Zeep): Sound painting direction\n Ama\u00ebl: Vocals\n C\u00e9cile: Violin\n Antonin: Upright and cello\n Ludovic: Harpsichord\n Track list:\nThe album is split in 72 tracks, in reference to the 72 translations of the  Septuagint.\n Concept:\nThe album is composed around Armageddon (which is a translation of Nigla[h]) and especially the seven (LXX/X) trumpets of the Book of Revelation.\nThe 72 tracks split is a reference to the Septuagint, as well as the LXX roman number. Finally, Tapisseries fines is an humoristic reference to the Apocalypse Tapestry.\nThe concept's idea came by reading the description of Abaddon in the New Testament (Book of Revelation), which was given to artworker Slip as a challenge for the artwork creation, as graphical representation of the Locusts King from this description seem impossible. It's the character who's illustrated on the cover.\n Technics:\nThis album has been recorded in the AMMD studio, a recording studio running on free software only, and based upon a Debian Linux distribution.\n\nDe la Persistance de la Mythologie Chottienne en ???

As such, this album is placed between Nagah Mahdi (Prophet's origines) and before Nigla[h] (Apocalypse) in terms of chronology, and that's why it begins with 48 phone messages, as Nagah Mahdi ended up on an automatic phone message by Y\u00fcla Slipobitch.\n Technics:\nThis album has been recorded in the AMMD studio, a recording studio running on free software only, and based upon a Debian GNU/Linux distribution.\n\nThe Ne[XXX]t Epilog\n Release date: 2012\n Production: AMMD\n Distribution (worldwide): Musea Records / Dogmazic\n Artwork: Slip\n Recording/Mix/Mastering : Cousin Sub\n Line-up:\n Y\u00fcla Slipobitch: Drums/Tubular Bells/Vocals\n Wladimir Ohrelianov II: Bass/Guitars/Machines/Gr\u00f6tterie/Vocals\n Souv Ponky Ponk: Saxophone/Vocals\n Track list:\nThe 1.0 physical version of this album is split into 22 tracks, distributed between 4 transitions and 18 movements composing 5 acts.\n Concept :\nConcept of this album is based upon the fact that Times don't exist as an obliged way, and that chronology might be turned upside/down. This is what the title, Ne[XXX]t Epilog, suggests.

It is called wet chemistry since most analyzing is done in the liquid phase. Wet chemistry is also called bench chemistry since many tests are performed at lab benches.\n\nMaterials\nWet chemistry commonly uses laboratory glassware such as beakers and graduated cylinders to prevent materials from being contaminated or interfered with by unintended sources. Gasoline, Bunsen burners, and crucibles may also be used to evaporate and isolate substances in their dry forms. Wet chemistry is not performed with any advanced instruments since most automatically scan substances. Although, simple instruments such as scales are used to measure the weight of a substance before and after a change occurs. Many high school and college laboratories teach students basic wet chemistry methods.\n\nHistory\nBefore the age of theoretical and computational chemistry, wet chemistry was the predominant form of scientific discovery in the chemical field. This is why it is sometimes referred to as classic chemistry or classical chemistry. Scientists would continuously develop techniques to improve the accuracy of wet chemistry. Later on, instruments were developed to conduct research impossible for wet chemistry. Over time, this became a separate branch of analytical chemistry called instrumental analysis. Because of the high volume of wet chemistry that must be done in today's society and new quality control requirements, many wet chemistry methods have been automated and computerized for streamlined analysis. The manual performance of wet chemistry mostly occurs in schools.\n\nMethods\n\nQualitative methods \nQualitative methods use changes in information that cannot be quantified to detect a change. This can include a change in color, smell, texture, etc.\n\nChemical tests \n\nChemical tests use reagents to indicate the presence of a specific chemical in an unknown solution. The reagents cause a unique reaction to occur based on the chemical it reacts with, allowing one to know what chemical is in the solution. An example is Heller's test where a test tube containing proteins has strong acids added to it. A cloudy ring forms where the substances meet, indicating the acids are denaturing the proteins. The cloud is a sign that proteins are present in a liquid. The method is used to detect proteins in a person's urine.\n\nFlame test \nThe flame test is a more well known version of the chemical test. It is only used on metallic ions. The metal powder is burned, causing an emission of colors based on what metal was burned. For example, calcium (Ca) will burn orange and copper (Cu) will burn blue. Their color emissions are used to produce bright colors in fireworks.\n\nQuantitative methods \nQuantitative methods use information that can be measured and quantified to indicate a change. This can include changes in volume, concentration, weight, etc.\n\nGravimetric analysis \n\nGravimetric analysis measures the weight or concentration of a solid that has either formed from a precipitate or dissolved in a liquid. The mass of the liquid is recorded before undergoing the reaction. For the precipitate, a reagent is added until the precipitate stops forming. The precipitate is then dried and weighed to determine the chemicals concentration in the liquid. For a dissolved substance, the liquid can be filtered until the solids are removed or boiled until all the liquid evaporates. The solids are left alone until completely dried and then weighed to determine its concentration. Evaporating all the liquid is the more common approach.\n\nVolumetric analysis \nTitration is called volumetric analysis since it relies on volume measurements to determine the quantity of a chemical. A reagent with a known volume and concentration is added to a solution with an unknown substance and concentration. The amount of reagent required for a change to occur is proportional to the amount of the unknown substances. This reveals the amount of the unknown substance present. If no visible change is present, an indicator is added to the solution. For example, a pH indicator changes color based on the pH of the solution. The exact point where the color change occurs is called the endpoint. Since the color change can occur very suddenly, it is important to be extremely precise with all measurements.\n\nColorimetry \nColorimetry is a unique method since it has both qualitative and quantitative properties. Its qualitative analysis involves recording color changes to indicate a change has occurred. This can be a change in shading of the color or a change into a completely different color. The quantitative aspect involves sensory equipment that can measure the wavelength of colors. Changes in wavelengths can be precisely measured and help indicate changes.\n\nUses\nWet chemistry techniques can be used for qualitative chemical measurements, such as changes in color (colorimetry), but often involves more quantitative chemical measurements, using methods such as gravimetry and titrimetry. Some uses for wet chemistry include tests for:\n\n pH (acidity, alkalinity)\n concentration\n conductivity (specific conductance)\n cloud point (nonionic surfactants)\n hardness\n melting point\n solids or dissolved solids\n salinity\n specific gravity\n density\n turbidity\n viscosity\n moisture (Karl Fischer titration)\n\nWet chemistry is also used in environmental chemistry settings to determine the current state of the environment. It is used to test:\n\n Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)\n Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)\n eutrophication\n coating identification\n\nIt can also involve the elemental analysis of samples, e.g., water sources, for items like:\n\n Ammonia nitrogen\n Chloride\n Chromium\n Cyanide\n Dissolved oxygen\n Fluoride\n Nitrogen\n Nitrate\n Phenols\n Phosphate\n Phosphorus\n Silica\n Sulfate, sulfide\n\nSee also\n Wet laboratory\n\nFurther reading\n\nReferences\n\nChemistry", ", founded in the 1830s, is one of the most active groups performing traditional ningy\u014d j\u014druri or Bunraku puppetry in Japan, and has been officially designated an Intangible Cultural Treasure. \n\nBased in the northern part of the city of Nagahama near the shore of Lake Biwa, in Shiga Prefecture, northeast of Kyoto, the Tonda Puppets have made international performance tours to Australia, New Zealand, and four times to the United States. The Tonda Troupe performs regularly at their own theater in Nagahama and on tour within Japan. The Tonda Puppet Troupe also instructs middle and high school students in bunraku puppetry and hosts training sessions for local citizens interested in pursuing the art of the traditional puppet theater. The Tonda Troupe has also been active in training American college and university students in traditional Japanese puppetry in academic programs sponsored by such institutions as Berea College in Kentucky and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, as well as the Japan Center for Michigan Universities, which is located in the nearby city of Hikone. In 2012 they also hosted a group of A-Level Theatre Studies students from Abingdon School and The School of St Helen and St Katharine, two independent schools in Abingdon, Oxfordshire.\n\nHistory\nThe Tonda Troupe traces it origins to the 1830s, when an itinerant puppet troupe that had been traveling through the area was snowbound in the village of Tonda, where they had intended to offer a performance. Unable to continue their journey home to Tokushima or to draw a paying audience because of the snow, the members of the itinerant troupe fell further and further into debt to the villagers for food and shelter. When the weather broke, the unfortunate troupe left their puppets behind as collateral for a loan for the boat fare necessary to travel to the southwestern end of Lake Biwa and beyond. When years passed and the Tokushima puppeteers never returned to pay the debt and reclaim the puppets, the villagers finally formed their own puppet troupe, and by the latter half of the nineteenth century, the Tonda Puppet Troupe had itself become a semi-professional troupe that gave performances locally and on the road. Today, the Tonda Puppet Troupe still uses in performance many of the same puppet heads abandoned by the original snowbound troupe. Some of these puppet heads are over 200 years old, though the bodies and costumes, which wear more quickly, have been remade over the years.\n\nFor generations, membership in the Tonda Troupe was restricted to men from the four families who had been traditionally associated with the theater, but in the 1970s the troupe began to welcome both men and women from outside those families, and in 1993, the Tonda Puppets became the first traditional puppet troupe in Japan to admit a non-Japanese member. A theater building, the Tonda Puppet Hall (pictured above right), containing a full stage, as well as rehearsal and meeting spaces, was built for the Troupe in 1991 by the government of Shiga Prefecture. The Tonda Troupe is currently headed by Hidehiko Abe, who traces his ancestry back seven generations to one of the founding members of the troupe.\n\nReferences\n\u51a8\u7530\u4eba\u5f62\u3053\u307c\u308c\u8a71, \u65e9\u5d0e \u89b3\u7e01\uff0f\u8457, 1985\n\nBunraku\nPuppet troupes\nTourist attractions in Shiga Prefecture\nTheatres in Japan\nNagahama, Shiga\nBuildings and structures in Shiga Prefecture\n1830s establishments in Japan", "Kuleshovka () is the name of several rural localities in Russia:\nKuleshovka, Belgorod Oblast, a selo in Krasnogvardeysky District of Belgorod Oblast\nKuleshovka, Babyninsky District, Kaluga Oblast, a village in Babyninsky District of Kaluga Oblast\nKuleshovka, Kozelsky District, Kaluga Oblast, a village in Kozelsky District of Kaluga Oblast\nKuleshovka, Sukhinichsky District, Kaluga Oblast, a village in Sukhinichsky District of Kaluga Oblast\nKuleshovka, Krasnodar Krai, a selo in Novopavlovsky Rural Okrug of Beloglinsky District of Krasnodar Krai\nKuleshovka, Kursk Oblast, a village in Blagodatensky Selsoviet of Korenevsky District of Kursk Oblast\nKuleshovka, Lipetsk Oblast, a village in Kosyrevsky Selsoviet of Lipetsky District of Lipetsk Oblast\nKuleshovka, Oryol Oblast, a village in Stanovo-Kolodezsky Selsoviet of Orlovsky District of Oryol Oblast\nKuleshovka, Rostov Oblast, a selo in Kuleshovskoye Rural Settlement of Azovsky District of Rostov Oblast\nKuleshovka, Samara Oblast, a selo in Neftegorsky District of Samara Oblast\nKuleshovka, Smolensk Oblast, a village in Vysokovskoye Rural Settlement of Novoduginsky District of Smolensk Oblast\nKuleshovka, Abakumovsky Selsoviet, Tokaryovsky District, Tambov Oblast, a village in Abakumovsky Selsoviet of Tokaryovsky District of Tambov Oblast\nKuleshovka, Sergiyevsky Selsoviet, Tokaryovsky District, Tambov Oblast, a village in Sergiyevsky Selsoviet of Tokaryovsky District of Tambov Oblast\nKuleshovka, Podgorensky District, Voronezh Oblast, a selo in Sergeyevskoye Rural Settlement of Podgorensky District of Voronezh Oblast\nKuleshovka, Ramonsky District, Voronezh Oblast, a village in Gorozhanskoye Rural Settlement of Ramonsky District of Voronezh Oblast", "The 2019 Women's FIH Pro League was the first season of the Pro League, the premier women's field hockey national team league series.

For example, the conductor of an orchestra keeps the orchestra synchronized or in time. Systems that operate with all parts in synchrony are said to be synchronous or in sync\u2014and those that are not are asynchronous.\n\nToday, time synchronization can occur between systems around the world through satellite navigation signals and other time and frequency transfer techniques.\n\nNavigation and railways \nTime-keeping and synchronization of clocks is a critical problem in long-distance ocean navigation.  Before radio navigation and satellite-based navigation, navigators required accurate time in conjunction with astronomical observations to determine how far east or west their vessel traveled. The invention of an accurate marine chronometer revolutionized marine navigation. By the end of the 19th century, important ports provided  time signals in the form of a signal gun, flag, or dropping time ball so that mariners could check and correct their chronometers for error.\n\nSynchronization was important in the operation of 19th-century railways, these being the first major means of transport fast enough for differences in local mean time between nearby towns to be noticeable. Each line handled the problem by synchronizing all its stations to headquarters as a standard railway time. In some territories, companies shared a single railroad track and needed to avoid collisions. The need for strict timekeeping led the companies to settle on one standard, and civil authorities eventually abandoned local mean time in favor of railway time.\n\nCommunication \n\nIn electrical engineering terms, for digital logic and data transfer, a synchronous circuit requires a clock signal.  A clock signal simply signals the start or end of some time period, often measured in microseconds or nanoseconds, that has an arbitrary relationship to any other system of measurement of the passage of minutes, hours, and days.\n\nIn a different sense, electronic systems are sometimes synchronized to make events at points far apart appear simultaneous or near-simultaneous from a certain perspective. Timekeeping technologies such as the GPS satellites and Network Time Protocol (NTP) provide real-time access to a close approximation to the UTC timescale and are used for many terrestrial synchronization applications of this kind.\n\nIn computer science (especially parallel computing), synchronization is the coordination of simultaneous threads or processes to complete a task with correct runtime order and no unexpected race conditions; see synchronization (computer science) for details.\n\nSynchronization is also an important concept in the following fields:\n Cryptography\n Lip sync\n Multimedia\n Rhythm\n Neuroscience\n Photography\n Physics (The idea of simultaneity has many difficulties, both in practice and theory.)\n Synthesizers\n Telecommunication\n Frame synchronization\n Synchronization (video)\n\nDynamical systems \n\nSynchronization of multiple interacting dynamical systems can occur when the systems are autonomous oscillators. Poincar\u00e9 phase oscillators are model systems that can interact and partially synchronize within random or regular networks. In the case of global synchronization of phase oscillators, an abrupt transition from unsynchronized to full synchronization takes place when the coupling strength exceeds a critical threshold. This is known as the Kuramoto model phase transition. Synchronization is an emergent property that occurs in a broad range of dynamical systems, including neural signaling, the beating of the heart and the synchronization of fire-fly light waves.\n\nApplications\n\nNeuroscience  \n\nIn cognitive neuroscience, (stimulus-dependent) (phase-)synchronous oscillations of neuron populations serve to solve the general \"binding problem\". According to the so-called \"Binding-By-Synchrony (BBS) Hypothesis\" a precise temporal correlation between the impulses of neurons (\"cross-correlation analysis\") and thus a stimulus-dependent temporal synchronization of the coherent activity of subpopulations of neurons emerges. Moreover, this synchronization mechanism circumvents the \"superposition problem\" by more effectively identifying the signature of synchronous neuronal signals as belonging together for subsequent (sub-)cortical information processing areas.\n\nCognitive science  \n\nIn cognitive science, integrative (phase) synchronization mechanisms in cognitive neuroarchitectures of modern connectionism that include coupled oscillators (e.g.\"Oscillatory Networks\") are used to solve the binding problem of cognitive neuroscience in perceptual cognition (\"feature binding\") and in language cognition (\"variable binding\").\n\nHuman movement \n\nSynchronization of movement is defined as similar movements between two or more people who are temporally aligned. This is different from mimicry, which occurs after a short delay. Line dance and military step are examples.\n\nMuscular bonding is the idea that moving in time evokes particular emotions. This sparked some of the first research into movement synchronization and its effects on human emotion. In groups, synchronization of movement has been shown to increase conformity, cooperation and trust.\n\nIn dyads, groups of two people, synchronization has been demonstrated to increase affiliation, self-esteem, compassion and altruistic behaviour and increase rapport. During arguments, synchrony between the arguing pair has been noted to decrease, however it is not clear whether this is due to the change in emotion or other factors. There is evidence to show that movement synchronization requires other people to cause its beneficial effects, as the effect on affiliation does not occur when one of the dyad is synchronizing their movements to something outside the dyad. This is known as interpersonal synchrony.\n\nThere has been dispute regarding the true effect of synchrony in these studies. Research in this area detailing the positive effects of synchrony, have attributed this to synchrony alone; however, many of the experiments incorporate a shared intention to achieve synchrony. Indeed, the Reinforcement of Cooperation Model suggests that perception of synchrony leads to reinforcement that cooperation is occurring, which leads to the pro-social effects of synchrony. More research is required to separate the effect of intentionality from the beneficial effect of synchrony.\n\nUses \nSynchronization is important in digital telephony, video and digital audio where streams of sampled data are manipulated. Synchronization of image and sound was an important technical problem in sound film. More sophisticated film, video, and audio applications use time code to synchronize audio and video. In movie and television production it is necessary to synchronize video frames from multiple cameras. In addition to enabling basic editing, synchronization can also be used for 3D reconstruction\n\nIn electric power systems, alternator synchronization is required when multiple generators are connected to an electrical grid.\n\nArbiters are needed in digital electronic systems such as microprocessors to deal with asynchronous inputs.  There are also electronic digital circuits called synchronizers that attempt to perform arbitration in one clock cycle.  Synchronizers, unlike arbiters, are prone to failure.  (See metastability in electronics).\n\nEncryption systems usually require some synchronization mechanism to ensure that the receiving cipher is decoding the right bits at the right time.\n\nAutomotive transmissions contain synchronizers that bring the toothed rotating parts (gears and splined shaft) to the same rotational velocity before engaging the teeth.\n\nFlash synchronization synchronizes the flash with the shutter.\n\nSome systems may be only approximately synchronized, or plesiochronous. Some applications require that relative offsets between events be determined. For others, only the order of the event is important.\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n J.

Balachander starring Mukesh, Khushbu, Nassar, Vineeth and Yuvarani. The film was released on 14 January 1993, and won the Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Film.\n\nPlot \nSriranjini, a ghazal singer, visits a hill station to forget the murder of her mother who was very close to her. She meets Kesavan, who is a taxi driver. He shares his own pain regarding his father murdering his mother and siblings in a drunken rage. Horrified by this story, Sriranjini starts thinking less of her own loss. A situation arises that Sriranjini starts living in house as a paying guest and their relationship remains aloof in spite of mutual admiration.\n\nThey run into lovers Vineeth and Yuvarani who call themselves Moscow and Berlin. They are from different religions, Hinduism and Islam. It is not revealed as to who is Muslim and who is Hindu. They inform that they eloped as they wanted to defy their parents concept of marriage. The pesky lovers try to bring Sriranjini and Kesavan together. They also move into the house of Kesavan but are closer to Sriranjini who comes out of her depression regarding her mother's death.\n\nSriranjini later finds that Kesavan's story regarding his families fate is entirely fabricated and he hails from an affluent family. He confesses that he lied to make her understand that some people have bigger tragedies than what she saw in her life. He could not live with his family as they were having too many properties and inheritance fights and so, he decided to forfeit his inheritance entirely and lead a simple life as a taxi driver.\n\nLater a rich North Indian man pays a lot of attention to Sriranjini and shows that he constantly listens to her music. Kesavan gets jealous of their constant chit chat in Hindi and regarding Ghazals and Sriranjini leaves the house after a fight. She finds that her patron almost keeps her in house arrest and expects her to be his mistress. Sriranjini wants to go back to Kesavan. The younger couple, Moscow and Berlin, try to help the older couple to get together.\n\nWhen caught by the rioters, Moscow and Berlin ask the rioters to find their religion from their blood. The city is in strict curfew and they are injured in gunfire. They bring the older couple together before dying in each other's arms.\n\nCast \nMukesh as Kesavan\nKhushbu as Sriranjini\nVineeth as Moscow\nYuvarani as Berlin\nMadhan Bob as Sathyam\nVichithra as Savitri, Sathyam's wife\nDhamu as Dhamu\nNassar as Director Pazhani Bhaskaran\n Rajesh Kumar as Reddy\nH.

He was also a candidate for the Republican presidential nominations in 1920 and 1928.\n\nBorn in Sunrise Township, Minnesota, Lowden practiced law in Chicago after graduating from the University of Iowa. He emerged as a local Republican leader and served in the House of Representatives from 1906 to 1911. He served as Governor of Illinois from 1917 to 1921, earning wide notice for his reorganization of state government and his handling of the Chicago race riot of 1919.\n\nAt the 1920 Republican National Convention, Lowden was the preferred candidate of many of the party's conservatives. His supporters coalesced behind Warren G. Harding as a compromise candidate, and Harding won both the nomination and the 1920 presidential election. Lowden was nominated for vice president at the 1924 Republican National Convention, but he declined the nomination. Lowden was a candidate for president at the 1928 Republican National Convention, but Herbert Hoover won the nomination on the first ballot.\n\nEarly life\nLowden was born in Sunrise Township, Minnesota, the son of Nancy Elizabeth (Breg) and Lorenzo Orren Lowden, a blacksmith. He lived in Iowa from the age of seven, on the farm in Hardin County, Iowa, in poverty. He attended school when chores on the family farm allowed.  At age fifteen he began to teach in a one room school house in Hubbard, Iowa.  \nAfter teaching five years, he entered the University of Iowa at twenty, graduating in 1885. \nHe aspired to be a lawyer, but taught high school for a year while learning stenography. \nThat skill got him a job in 1886 at the Dexter law firm in Chicago, and he took evening courses at the \nUnion College of Law, completing the two year curriculum in one year, finishing as valedictorian  in 1887. He was admitted to the bar the same year and practiced law in Chicago for about 20 years. His wife, Florence, was the daughter of George Pullman. In 1899, he was professor of law at Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois.\n\nPolitical career\n\nIn 1900, Lowden declined the first assistant postmaster-generalship, offered him by President McKinley, whom he had supported. He was a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1900 and 1904, and from 1904 to 1912 was a member of the Republican National Committee. He was also a member of the executive committee in 1904 and 1908. Lowden was elected a U.S. Representative from Illinois in 1906 to fill the unexpired term of Robert R. Hitt, deceased. He was re-elected for succeeding terms until 1911, when he declined to run for another term.\n\nFrom 1917 to 1921, he was the Governor of Illinois. While governor, he won wide notice for the major reorganization of state government he spearheaded. He introduced the budget system for state expenditure, thereby reducing the rate of taxation in spite of rising prices. He was a strong supporter of the death penalty, and when in 1918 both houses of the Illinois General Assembly voted to abolish capital punishment, he vetoed the bill. He was energetic in marshalling the resources of his state in support of the United States' World War I effort. In 1917, when the mayor of Chicago refused to interfere with a meeting of the People's Council, an organization accused of pro-Germanism, he ordered out the state troops to prevent the meeting. He favoured woman suffrage and the enforcement of the Volstead Act for war-time prohibition. He was opposed to the League of Nations without reservations, on the ground that it would create a super-state. He gained nationwide stature for his handling of the Chicago Race Riot of 1919 and a simultaneous transit strike in Chicago.\n\nHe was a leading candidate for the Republican nomination for president in 1920.  His campaign was embarrassed by reports of profligate spending.  His Missouri campaign manager gave out $32,000 to promote his campaign, including $2,500 (a laborer's annual wage) to at least two convention delegates.  Delegates at the Republican convention deadlocked over several ballots between Lowden and General Leonard Wood, resulting in party leaders meeting privately to determine a compromise candidate. Their choice, Warren G. Harding, went on to win the nomination. In the 1924 election, he declined the Republican nomination for vice president. In 1928, he again positioned himself to run for the party's nomination, but he was never much more than a minor threat to front runner Herbert Hoover, who went on to win the presidential nomination and the election.\n\nRailroad career\n\nIn 1933, Lowden was appointed to be one of three receivers for the bankrupt Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. He served in this capacity with co-receivers Joseph B. Fleming and James E. Gorman (the latter had been president of the railroad since 1917) until his death in 1943 in Tucson, Arizona. His remains are buried in Graceland Cemetery, Chicago.\n\nLegacy\nThe following are named after Lowden: Camp Lowden Boy Scout Camp, Lowden State Park and Lowden-Miller State Forest, all near his estate outside Oregon, Illinois; the Frank O.

When a star is fully within hydrostatic equilibrium\u2014a condition where the inward force of gravity is matched by the outward pressure of the gas\u2014the star can not exceed the radius defined by the Hayashi limit. This has important implications for the evolution of a star, both during the formulative contraction period and later when the star has consumed most of its hydrogen supply through nuclear fusion.\n\nA Hertzsprung-Russell diagram displays a plot of a star's surface temperature against the luminosity. On this diagram, the Hayashi limit forms a nearly vertical line at about 3,500 K. The outer layers of low temperature stars are always convective, and models of stellar structure for fully convective stars do not provide a solution to the right of this line. Thus in theory, stars are constrained to remain to the left of this limit during all periods when they are in hydrostatic equilibrium, and the region to the right of the line forms a type of \"forbidden zone\". Note, however, that there are exceptions to the Hayashi limit. These include collapsing protostars, as well as stars with magnetic fields that interfere with the internal transport of energy through convection.\n\nRed giants are stars that have expanded their outer envelope in order to support the nuclear fusion of helium. This moves them up and to the right on the H-R diagram. However, they are constrained by the Hayashi limit not to expand beyond a certain radius.\n\nThe Hayashi limit is named after Ch\u016bshir\u014d Hayashi, a Japanese astrophysicist.\n\nSee also\n Hayashi track\n Eddington limit\n\nReferences\n\nStellar evolution\nAstrophysics", "Hormurus karschii is a species of scorpion belonging to the family Hormuridae.\n\nDescription\nHormurus karschii can reach a length of about .

Wiggins (September 19, 1928 \u2013 October 13, 2001) was the founder of Silent News, the first newspaper for the deaf.\n\nPersonal life\nHe was born in North York, Ontario, Canada, and attended Belleville School for the Deaf in Belleville, Ontario. Later he transferred to a vocational school focusing on tailoring skills. Once he was at the trade school, his father who was in the fur business saw much potential in Julius. His father then took him under his wing and they began working alongside another. Later he met Harriet Berkowitz in New York City at a deaf event; he then asked for her hand in marriage. They married on March 23, 1952. Harriet and Julius worked hand in hand in the production of Silent News. They were married for 49 years and had three children. He loved to travel with his family. Throughout his life, they explored many different countries. He believed that high visibility was key to gathering information for the newspaper (Trudy). He was active in promoting organizations to the deaf community. The organizations he was a part of include \"Temple Beth Or of the Deaf in Queens New York\", the Philadelphia Hebrew Association of the Deaf, New York Hebrew Association of the Deaf, and Brooklyn Hebrew Society of the Deaf. He was not only active in the organizations listed above he was also a member of the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf.\n\nCareer\n\nAt 20 years of age, Wiggins moved to New York City to further his career in the fur business and worked at the Manhattan fur district. It was hard for him as a deaf man to have equal opportunities in the workplace. But with his dedication and determination, he worked his way to the top of his company. Once the fur market plummeted, he became unemployed. Later he found a job at a postal service. He found the job to be tedious and was ridiculed by his hearing co-workers. It was not until he took a family trip that his career path dramatically changed. On the family vacation, he saw a sign that said, \"Who, What, Where, and Why.\" That inspired him with ideas for the future of the deaf community. He was able to get 10 of his closest deaf friends together to organize and fund a paper company geared towards the deaf and hard of hearing community that would soon be known as Silent News. Each invested $250.00 into the company (Rachel). Soon after, Silent News was born in January 1969. Each issue was 15 cents. His family played a vital role in the production of the newspaper in the first year. The headquarters for the newspaper were in Mount Laurel, New Jersey. Wiggins held a huge role in connecting the deaf community and allowing them to be aware of upcoming events and news. The newspaper brought national and international news, latest technology, health and sports, and stories about successful and up in coming deaf people. Later he wrote an autobiography called No Sound, published in 1972, which recounted in depth about many hardships he encountered with hearing individuals and the oppression he felt throughout his life (Trudy). Silent News has left an everlasting footprint for the future of the deaf community. In the 1990s due to his failing health the newspaper was sold to Adele Wiggins. Soon after he died on October 13, 2001.\n\nSilent News\nWiggins and his family moved from North York, Ontario to a home in Fair Lawn, New Jersey, where they intended to start a newspaper for the deaf.<ref>Matsumoto, Lori. \"No Sound speaks up for the world of silence\", 'The Mirror, July 5, 1970. Accessed November 30, 2017. \"Julius Wiggins was born here in Toronto and grew up here. His love of the city and its idiosyncracies are obvious. He and his wife and three children lived on Acton Avenue in Downsview for 10 years before moving to Fair Lawn, New Jersey to begin publishing Silent News a year and a half ago.\"</ref> The first issue of Silent News was launched on January 1, 1969, its focus being to bring awareness to events, news, sports, etc. for the deaf. The newspaper would have about 7,000 subscribers per month but in actuality more than 30,000 would be reading (Jamie). This was due to people passing around the paper. This hindered the newspaper greatly; it did not allow the newspaper he profit to succeed. Even though the newspaper struggled throughout the years it managed to survive and outlast its competition. With the technological advances, Silent News began to expand to the web. The subscribers decreased soon after and in return Silent News came to an end. Silent News'' changed the life of many deaf people throughout the years. It was an iconic media device. It was the first media outlet geared towards the deaf, opening the door to many other media outlets for the deaf.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n \n \n \n\n1928 births\n2001 deaths\nActivists from Toronto\nCanadian newspaper publishers (people)\nDeaf activists\nDeaf writers\nPeople from Fair Lawn, New Jersey\nPeople from North York\nWriters from Toronto\nCanadian deaf people", "\"Aircompany \"SIBIA\" ltd (\u041e\u0431\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0441 \u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c\u044e \u00ab\u0410\u0432\u0438\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u00ab\u0421\u0418\u0411\u0418\u0410\u00bb, Ob\u00e7estvo s ograni\u010dennoj otvetstvennostjju \u00abAviakompanija\u00bb) is a Russian airline specialising in various forms of aerial work including crop-spraying, medical flights and search-and-rescue.

The airfield was located in Chilbolton approximately  south-southeast of Andover, about  southwest of London\n\nOpened in 1940, it was used by the Royal Air Force and later by the United States Army Air Forces.  During the war it was used primarily as a troop carrier airfield for parachutists. After the war it was used for military jet aircraft training before closing as an RAF station in 1946, although it was then used until the early 1960s by the Vickers-Supermarine and Folland aircraft companies for flight testing and development flying.\n\nToday the remains of the airfield are located on private property, being used as agricultural fields.\n\nHistory\n\nRoyal Air Force use\nRAF Chilbolton was opened in September 1940 as a satellite of RAF Middle Wallop and was used as a relief landing ground. At first it was developed piecemeal with the addition of the necessary facilities that took it towards existence as an independent airfield.  It then hosted its own Hawker Hurricane squadrons which took part in the Battle of Britain.  No. 238 Squadron RAF operated throughout the Battle of Britain from Middle Wallop and RAF St Eval as part of No. 10 Group Fighter Command, posted to Chilbolton in September 1940 with Hurricane Is.\n\nDuring the Battle of Britain many sorties were flown covering Southampton to Bristol. Once the battle had been won and the threat of invasion had passed, major Luftwaffe raids ceased. Several Spitfire and Hurricane squadrons came and went, none stayed very long.\n\nBy late 1941 Chilbolton had been upgraded with the addition of a perimeter track and several concrete dispersal pens around it.\n\nBy November 1941 it was placed into \"care and maintenance\" as there was no use for it by then, as the Battle of Britain had ended and there were sufficient airfields in the area to continue the war without it.\n\nRAF Units stationed at Chilbolton:\n 238 Sqn, Hurricane I, arrived 30 September 1940, departed 20 May 1941.\n Glider Pilots Exercise Unit, de Havilland Tiger Moth/Miles Master/General Aircraft Hotspur arrived Dec-Jan 1941.\n 238 Sqn, Hurricane IIA, arrived 1 February 1941, departed April 1941.\n 308 Sqn, Spitfire IIA, arrived 31 May 1941, departed 24 June 1941.\n 501 Sqn, Spitfire IIA, arrived 25 June 1941, departed 5 August 1941.\n 504 Sqn, Hurricane IIB, arrived 11 August 1941, departed 26 August 1941.\n 245 Sqn, Hurricane IIB, arrived 1 September 1941, departed 17 Nov 1941.\n 245 Sqn, Hurricane IIB, arrived 23 Nov 1941, departed 19 Dec 1941.\n 184 Sqn, Hurricane IID, arrived 1 March 1943, departed 11 March 1943.\n 174 Sqn, Hurricane IIB, arrived 1 March 1943, departed 11 March 1943.\n\nAmerica came into the war after the bombing of Pearl Harbor by the Japanese in late 1941, and the Allies began preparations for the invasion of Europe. RAF Chilbolton was then allocated to the Americans and transferred to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF), playing host to Army Co-operation Command units.\n\nUSAAF use\nChilbolton was known as USAAF Station AAF-404 for security reasons by the USAAF during the war, and by which it was referred to instead of location. Its RAF and USAAF Station Code was \"CB\".\n\n368th Fighter Group\nOn 1 March 1944 the 12th and 15th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons from the 67th Reconnaissance Wing, flying Spitfires and Mustangs, moved in from RAF Aldermaston to make way for a C-47 group, only to be ejected two weeks later when a new fighter group arrived.  The 368th had the following fighter squadrons and fuselage codes:\n 395th Fighter Squadron (A7)\n 396th Fighter Squadron (C2)\n 397th Fighter Squadron (D3)\n\nThe 368th was a group of Ninth Air Force's 71st Fighter Wing, IX Tactical Air Command.  \n \nChilbolton continued to be retained by the USAAF for use by transports as a staging airfield for cargo operations to and from the Continent and it was not returned to the RAF until March 1945, by which time most of the C-47 groups had been transferred to forward stations in France.\n\nBack to RAF Control\nIn the hands of the RAF, Chilbolton played host to a fighter Operational Training Unit \u2013 No. 41 OTU \u2013 for the rest of World War II, and then to several different fighter squadrons equipped with Supermarine Spitfires and Hawker Tempests as the RAF reduced its strength at the end of the war.\n No 41 OTU, Hurricane/Spitfire/Master/Martinet, arrived March 1945, disbanded 26 June 1945.\n 26 Sqn, Mustang I/Spitfire XIV, arrived 23 May 1945, departed 20 August 1945.\n 183 Sqn, Spitfire IX, arrived 17 June 1945, departed 8 October 1945.\n 247 Sqn, Tempest F2/Typhoon Ib, arrived 20 August 1945, departed 7 January 1946.\n 222 Sqn, Tempest V, arrived 10 August 1945, departed 15 August 1945.\n 54 Sqn, Tempest F2, arrived 15 November 1945, departed 28 June 1946.\n 183 Sqn, Tempest II, arrived 15 November 1945, disbanded 15 November 1945.\n\nInto the 'Jet Age' \nIn March 1946, Chilbolton became the first RAF station to operate de Havilland Vampire jets when 247 squadron converted to Vampire FB1's, but by the late summer that year the station was on care and maintenance.\n 247 Sqn, Tempest F2/Vampire F1, arrived 16 February 1946, departed 1 June 1946.\n 247 Sqn, Vampire F1, arrived 12 June 1946, departed 27 June 1946.\n\nThe following units were also here at some point:\n No. 1 Fighter Command Servicing Unit\n Satellite of No. 2 School of Army Co-operation (April - May 1941)\n Sub site for No. 3 Maintenance Unit RAF (October 1945 - June 1948)\n No. 122 Airfield RAF (February - March 1943)\n No. 124 (Rocket Projectile) Wing (April 1946)\n No. 129 (RAF) Wing (November - December 1945)\n No. 202 Maintenance Unit RAF (April 1950 - June 1954)\n No. 2719 Squadron RAF Regiment\n No. 2723 Squadron RAF Regiment\n No. 2766 Squadron RAF Regiment\n Aircraft for Southern Sector (January - May 1946)\n\nPost-war\nWith the facility released from military control in 1946, Vickers Supermarine selected the airfield as a location for conducting flight development programmes of their jet prototypes and development aircraft, remaining for the best part of ten years.  Supermarine Attacker, Supermarine Swift and  Supermarine Scimitar were developed there as well as many early experimental swept-wing jet fighters. The airfield was also used for some location filming of David Lean's classic film The Sound Barrier in the early 1950s. The Spitfire T Mk IX, a 2-seat trainer and the last Spitfire variant to be built, was also developed and test-flown at Chilbolton for export to India and Eire (Southern Ireland).\n\nFolland Aircraft also occupied another part of the airfield to conduct similar work on their products, chiefly the Midge and Gnat, but were gone by the end of 1961. With their departure, the wartime airfield began to be dismantled, with large sections of runway, perimeter track and loop hardstands being removed for hardcore.\n\nThe next organisation to take an active interest in the site was the Space Research Council which, in 1963, set about building a large observatory with what was to become a prominent local landmark - a radio telescope, known as the Chilbolton Observatory, which was built almost in the centre of the airfield, on the wartime main runway.  When constructed, the north end of the runway was removed, with a two lane access road replacing the runway and connecting to the local road network.  The radio telescope is still in use today. Various other enterprises flourished or faded in the buildings on the periphery of the airfield.\n\nFlying continued on the old airfield during the 1980s when helicopters and light aircraft serving a field-spraying organisation were in residence, using a grass strip built parallel to the main north\u2013south 12/30 runway.\n\nCurrent use\n\nToday, the perimeter track has been largely reduced to a single-lane farm road as much of the airfield has been returned to agricultural use.  A large section of the 06/24 secondary runway still exists, although reduced to half width.  In aerial photography, however, much of the former wartime airfield's runways and hardstands can be seen as disturbances on the landscape, giving a ghostly appearance to the area. A large Type B.1 hangar also survives in agricultural use on the Leckford Estate which occupies the SW corner of the former airfield.\n\nFlying still takes place at Chilbolton with the Chilbolton Flying Club having established an airstrip on the former playing fields in front of the old RAF gymnasium with planning consent being obtained in 1992. Today club members fly light aircraft and ultralights from the airstrip.\n\nSee also\n\nList of former Royal Air Force stations\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n Brooks, Robin.

As of the 2000 census, the township population was 3,209. The township was organized in 1858, before Mecosta County was detached from Newaygo County.\n\nCommunities \nParis is an unincorporated community and the largest settlement within the township at  on the Muskegon River about  north of Big Rapids. John Parish is considered the \"father\" of the village, having arrived in the 1850s and then platted the village in 1865. It was at first named Parish after him, but the name later became Paris.  A fire on May 26,1879, destroyed a large portion of the village, including records of Green Township. The Paris ZIP code, 49338, serves the northwest portion of Green Township. Paris Park, north of town, was the site of the second fish hatchery in the state of Michigan. The Paris Fish Hatchery opened in 1881, and from 1913 to 1938, salmon and brown trout fingerlings were shipped by rail baggage cars in milk cans painted a distinctive red. The Works Progress Administration renovated and expanded the facility in the mid-1930s. The hatchery operated until 1964, and in 1972 was acquired by the Mecosta County Park Commission and refurbished as a park that reopened in July 1976.  In 1980, students from the Mecosta-Osceola Career Center in Big Rapids built a  replica of the Eiffel Tower out of metal frames from WPA workers' beds that had been stored in barns.\n\nGeography\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which  is land and  (1.76%) is water.

The species was first described by Michael Denis and Ignaz Schifferm\u00fcller in 1775. It is found from Europe to the eastern part of the Palearctic realm. The main habitats are warm slopes, heathlands, fields and abandoned quarries. In the mountains, the species rises to heights of 1000 meters. Adults are on wing from July to August.\n\nDescription\nThe wingspan is 25\u201330\u00a0mm. The graduated buff coloured forewing has a red or brown diagonal slash from the wing tip to the inside edge. The hindwings are white with a faint diagonal grey streak and a dot on the upper surface. The male has combed antennae. The female is more mottled than the male and has less combed antennae. The egg initially has a light green colour, which changes from reddish yellow to grey just before the caterpillars hatch. The pole and egg base are orange. The surface is covered with about 50 longitudinal ribs. The micropyle rosette is ten to eleven-leaves and surrounded by a large-mesh network. The larva is ochreous grey, with a blackish, ochreous-edged dorsal line and various other fine darker and paler longitudinal lines.\n\nDiet\nThe larvae feed on various herbaceous plants, including Potentilla, Thymus, Andromeda polifolia and possibly Empetrum nigrum, Rubus chamaemorus and Vaccinium uliginosum.\n\nSubspecies\nAspitates gilvaria gilvaria\nAspitates gilvaria fenica (Fuchs, 1899) Finland and the Baltic states\nAspitates gilvaria orientaria (Alph\u00e9raky, 1892) Caucasus, Thian Shan, Sajan and  Amdo districts with little or no dark irroration.\nAspitates gilvaria burrenensis Cockayne, 1951\ndarker than the nominate subspecies with a longer hindwing stripe - found in the Burren, Ireland\n\nSimilar species\nAspitates ochrearia differs by an additional thin grey inner transverse line on the front wing upperside.\n\nReferences\n\nGallery\n\nExternal links\n\nStraw belle at UKMoths\nFauna Europaea\nLepiforum e.V.\n\nAspitatini\nMoths of Europe\nMoths of Asia\nTaxa named by Michael Denis\nTaxa named by Ignaz Schifferm\u00fcller\nMoths described in 1775", "Po\u0142onina Cary\u0144ska, () also known as Po\u0142onina Berehowska, is a polonyna in the Bieszczady Mountains laying between valleys of the Dwernik and Wo\u0142osaty rivers, which contain the settlements of Brzegi G\u00f3rne and Ustrzyki G\u00f3rne. It has four major culminations, the highest is Kruhly Wierch (1297\u00a0m), while the other ones have the heights of 1245, 1239 and 1148 metres.\n\nSimilar to Po\u0142onina Wetli\u0144ska, the southwestern slopes are sharp and short, while the southeastern ones are softer, filled with streams that form small valleys and are usually the preferred route.

It used to own a church and a cemetery in those lands, but they were moved and rebuilt  in 1929. There are other villages which owned pastures on the land, such as Berehy G\u00f3rne, Bere\u017cki and Ustrzyki G\u00f3rne. Grazing was still being carried out by those villages until the end of the interwar period, and due to large numbers of animals, the development of trees was limited and shaped the mountain's look to how it is today.

An example of a plant with epigeal germination is the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris). The opposite of epigeal is hypogeal (underground germination).\n\n| Epi: Above + Geo: Earth | + Germination\n\nEpigeal germination \n\nEpigeal germination implies that the cotyledons are pushed above ground. The hypocotyl elongates while the epicotyl remains the same in length. In this way, the hypocotyl pushes the cotyledon upward.\n\nNormally, the cotyledon itself contains very little nutrients in plants that show this kind of germination. Instead, the first leaflets are already folded up inside it, and photosynthesis starts to take place in it rather quickly.\n\nBecause the cotyledon is positioned above the ground it is much more vulnerable to damage like night-frost  or grazing. The evolutionary strategy is that the plant produces a large number of seeds, of which statistically a number survive.\n\nPlants that show epigeal germination need external nutrients rather quickly in order to develop, so they are more frequent on nutrient-rich soils. The plants also need relatively more sunlight for photosynthesis to take place. Therefore they can be found more often in the field, at the border of forests, or as pioneer species.\n\nPlants that show epigeal germination grow relatively fast, especially in the first phase when the leaflets unfold. Because of this, they occur frequently in areas that experience regular flooding, for example at the river borders in the Amazon region. The fast germination enables the plant to develop before the next flooding takes place. After the faster first phase, the plant develops more slowly than plants that show hypogeal germination.\n\nIt is possible that within the same genus one species shows epigeal germination while another species shows hypogeal germination. Some genera in which this happens are:\nPhaseolus: the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) shows epigeal germination, whereas the runner bean (Phaseolus coccineus) shows hypogeal germination\nLilium: see Lily seed germination types\nAraucaria: species in the section Eutacta show epigeal germination, whereas species in the section Araucaria show hypogeal germination\n\nPhanerocotylar vs. cryptocotylar\nIn 1965, botanist James A. Duke introduced the terms phanerocotylar and cryptocotylar as synonyms for epigeal and hypogeal respectively, because he didn't consider these terms etymologically correct. Later, it was discovered that there are rare cases of species where the germination is epigeal and cryptocotylar. Therefore, divisions have been proposed that take both factors into account.\n\nReferences\n\nPlant reproduction", "Bellevue is an eastern suburb of Perth, Western Australia in the local government areas of the City of Swan and the Shire of Mundaring. It is at the foot of the slopes of Greenmount, a landmark on the Darling Scarp that is noted in the earliest of travel journals of the early Swan River Colony.\n\nCommunity \nBellevue has been bisected by the Roe Highway, railway, and substantial changes in the eastern parts of Midland.  The Bellevue Primary School was closed and amalgamated with the Koongamia Primary School to form the new Clayton View Primary School slightly up the hill towards Greenmount.\n\nIt was the location of the original offices of what became the Mundaring Shire Council. \nIt was also the location of the Catholic Church that preceded the St Anthony's church in Greenmount.\n\nA significant point of contact in the twentieth century for the  local community was the Darling Range Hotel.\n\nGeography\nBellevue is bounded by the Helena River to the south, Great Eastern Highway to the north and Military Road and Cowie Close to the west. The suburb is an even mix of residential, industrial and parkland (mainly along the Helena River).\n\nBeing at the eastern part of the Swan Coastal Plain, Bellevue is also at the foot of the Darling Scarp with Greenmount Hill as the point of access to the region to the east.\n\nChange\nBellevue has  changed over the duration of its existence due to a number of factors - the extensive claypits of the early twentieth century (most having been since filled in), and the industrial locations adjacent to the railway lines. \n \nThe creation of the standard gauge railway and the removal of the railway station in the mid-1960s removed it from the railway map.  Construction of the Roe Highway embankment in the western part removed a section of the suburb. The Midland Military Markets were located in the west of the suburb, but were destroyed by a fire in April 2007.\n\nRailways \n\nOriginally known as the  siding in 1896, it became known as Bellevue on 24 May 1897. It was the railway station at the foot of the hills through which the Eastern Railway climbed, first for the line that proceeded east to Greenmount then Boya, Darlington and on to Mundaring, then for the line through Blackboy Hill, Swan View, the Swan View Tunnel and on to Chidlow.  The third and final route of the railway that goes through the Avon Valley passes over the site where the railway station was located.\n\nDuring the First World War the branch line to the Helena Vale Race course was used for transporting troops between Blackboy Hill and Fremantle.\n\nAlthough the old Mundaring Loop was closed for passenger traffic in 1954, trains were still utilising the line to Boya, where the Mountain Quarries siding was still in use.  This operation closed in 1962.\n\nUp until the 1960s it was the terminus of the passenger services from Perth. From 1960 to 1962 a new railway station was made at Koongamia, which was half-way to the old Greenmount Railway station. The suburban service now terminates at Midland.\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nExternal links\nMundaring and Hills Historical Society website\n Bellevue on Geoscience Australia\n\nSuburbs of Perth, Western Australia\nSuburbs and localities in the City of Swan\nSuburbs and localities in the Shire of Mundaring", "This is a list of the 326 members of the 12th legislature of the Italian Senate that were elected in the 1994 general election.

The story, first published in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine in February 1982, involves a time-traveling historian who goes back to the Blitz in London, to participate in the fire lookout at St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nPlot\n\nThe narrator is a student historian from a future where historians use time-travel to study history directly. He had prepared himself to visit St. Paul in the first century but instead gets sent to St. Paul's Cathedral in 1940. He develops a deep emotional attachment to the cathedral and is highly devoted to his role in defending it \u2013 especially due to his bitter knowledge that St. Paul's would survive the World War II bombings but would be obliterated in a terrorist attack nearer to the protagonist's own time.\n\nReception\nThe story won both a Hugo Award for Best Novelette and a Nebula Award for Best Novelette.\n\nRelationships to other Willis works\n\"Fire Watch\" (1982) was included in Willis' short-story collections Fire Watch (1984) and The Best of Connie Willis: Award-Winning Stories (2013).\n\nThe idea of a time-traveling history department at Oxford University, introduced in this novelette, was also used in her later novels Doomsday Book (1992), To Say Nothing of the Dog (1997), and Blackout/All Clear (2010), as was the character of Professor James Dunworthy.\n\nAlthough Willis' writing of \"Fire Watch\" predates the production of Doomsday Book by about a decade, Kivrin Engle, the main character of Doomsday Book, also appears as a minor character in \"Fire Watch\".

It is located in the Alpilles mountains, atop a rocky outcrop that is crowned with a ruined castle overlooking the plains to the south. Its name refers to its site: in Proven\u00e7al, bau\u00e7 is a rocky spur. From the village name the word bauxite was coined for aluminium ore when first discovered there by geologist Pierre Berthier in 1821.\n\nNamed after the province of Provence, it is considered one of the most beautiful villages in France and has over 1.5 million visitors per year although it has only 22 residents in the upper part of the commune and 436 for the whole commune. Inhabitants of the commune are known as Baussencs or Baussenques.\n\nHistory\n\nPrehistory\nThe defensive capabilities of Baux have always made it an attractive location for human habitation. Traces of habitation have been found and dated to 6000 BC. in the Costap\u00e9ra cave which was discovered in 1928 and which houses a collective burial ground from the early Bronze Age. The site was used by the Celts as a fort or oppidum around the 2nd century BC. Peripheral areas or castrum developed very early as evidenced by the Tr\u00e9ma\u00ef\u00e9. The way from the Baux oppidum to the plains north of the Alpilles was by a protohistoric way through the valley of Laval and the town of Glanon which later took the name Glanum.\n\nAntiquity\n\nWhile Protohistory was strongly marked by pastoralism and agriculture in the Alpilles, limestone was also extracted from quarries around Baux where a workshop from the end of the 2nd and early 1st centuries BC has been found. In the second part of the Iron Age (7th to 6th centuries. BC), the population was sedentary and began to build durable houses. The castrum was structured like a village with its streets and houses. The process of permanent construction was in parallel with the intensification of economic exchanges with Mediterranean traders. In exchange for luxury goods, the inhabitants of the Alpilles produced grain and achieved a state of autarky with a real trading economy. Over the following centuries the population of the Alpilles consistently decreased: the Greek colony at Arles attracted many people from across the region.\n\nMiddle Ages\nIn the Middle Ages the area became the stronghold of a feudal domain covering 79 towns and villages. The fortress was built from the 11th to the 13th century over seven hectares. The princes of Baux controlled Provence for many years and they gained a formidable reputation. They were said to be descended from the Biblical Magi Balthazar and their coat of arms was a silver star with sixteen branches as a reminder that, according to the Gospel, it guided the three wise men to Bethlehem. Their motto was:  \"Au hasard, Balthazar\" (\"To chance, Balthazar\").\n\nAs a medieval stronghold on the borders of Languedoc, Comtat Venaissin and Provence, the fortress had a turbulent military history and has been the subject of many assaults. The solid dungeon that still dominates the village today reiterates the importance of this castle which was a desirable possession in the Middle Ages.\n\nAt the end of the Baussenque Wars in the 12th century the princes of Baux were defeated. The large castle began to be renowned for its highly cultivated court and chivalrous conduct. The estate finally came to an end in the 15th century after the death of the last princess of Baux.\n\nThe death of Queen Joanna I of Naples led to a crisis of succession to the County of Provence. The cities of the Aix Union (1382\u20131387) supported Charles, Duke of Durazzo, against Louis I, Duke of Anjou. The King of France, Charles VI, intervened and sent the Seneschal of Beaucaire, Enguerrand d'Eudin, who rallied Guillaume III Roger de Beaufort. Les Baux, the possession of the Roger, was thus neutral at the beginning of war and on the Angevin side at the end of the decade.\n\nLate Middle Ages\n\nLes Baux, together with Provence, was then attached to the crown of France. Under the rule of the Manville family, the village became a center of Protestantism and even tried a rebellion against the crown. In 1631, tired of conflict, the people negotiated with the king for the redemption of the castle territory and the right to dismantle the fortifications, \"which were a refuge for rebels\". Louis XIII consented on 5 August.\n\nIn 1642 the town was offered to the Grimaldi family as a marquisate in favour of Hercule de Grimaldi, Prince of Monaco (1642-1780). The title Marquis of Baux is still carried by the Prince of Monaco. Administratively, the town is entirely French and the title of Marquis of Baux is traditionally given to the heir to the throne of Monaco. Jacques, the son of the current Prince of Monaco Albert II, carries among his many titles that of Marquis of Baux.\n\nModern Period\nIn 1822 bauxite was discovered in the area by geologist Pierre Berthier. The ore was intensively mined until its exhaustion at the end of the 20th century.\n\nGeography\n\nLes Baux-de-Provence is located in the foothills of the Alpilles in the Parc Naturel Regional des Alpilles some 22 kilometers south of Avignon and 15 kilometers north-east of Arles. Access to the commune is by the D27 road from Maussane-les-Alpilles in the south which passes through the village and continues north to join the D99 east of Mas-Blanc-des-Alpilles. The D5 also comes from Maussane-les-Alpilles in the south and passes through the east of the commune as it goes north to Saint-R\u00e9my-de-Provence. The D27A links the two roads in the commune. The D78F branches from the D27 in the commune and goes south-west to join the D17 west of Paradou. Apart from the village there are the hamlets of Mes de Mai, Carita, and Manville. The commune is farmland in the south-east and forested hills in the rest.\n\nThe commune is traversed by numerous streams which are called \"gaudres\". A Gaudre (from the Proven\u00e7al Gaudre meaning \"small stream\") refers to a river often dry in summer and with low flow the rest of the year. The main gaudres in the commune are the Gaude de Valmouirane  with numerous tributaries flowing north to join the Canal du Vigueirat north of Mas-Blanc-des-Alpilles. The Gaudre du Mas de Chevrier also with numerous tributaries flows west to join the Gaudre d'Auge west of the commune. The Gaudre d'Entreconque flows from the north-east to south to join the Gaudre de la Foux which continues south to join the Canal des Pompes south of Maussane-les-Alpilles.\n\nClimate\nThe climate in Les Baux-de-Provence, as in the rest of the Alpilles, is considered Mediterranean. The winters are mild and dry and summers hot and dry. The average maximum temperature is in July and August (29\u00a0\u00b0C) with the lowest average minimum temperature in December and January (+ 3\u00a0\u00b0C). The wettest month is January with an average of 7 days of rain against two days in July. The Alpilles region receives more rainfall than the shores of the Mediterranean: 500\u00a0mm / year in Camargue against 600 to 700\u00a0mm / year in Les Baux. Major frosts are rare and were more frequent in the 19th century as evidenced by repeated freezing of the Rh\u00f4ne which has been virtually unknown since then.\n\nThe mistral violently blows from the north or north-west especially in winter and spring. The Alpilles deflect the wind but it blows in Baux almost as strong as in the north of the chain. The mistral blows strongly 100 days a year on average and less strong on 83 days leaving only 182 days a year without wind. There are two types of mistral: the \"white mistral\" on clear days and the \"black mistral\", rarer, which is accompanied by rain.\n\nFlora and fauna\nThe flora in the commune is mainly xerophytic and Mediterranean Phytochorion. The botanist Bernard Girerd counted 800 plant species in 1992. Apart from the olive tree, characteristic of a maussanais landscape, there are also hackberries, small sized Kermes oak, and Shadbush. Protected plant species, such as the summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum) and H\u00e9lianth\u00e8me (Helianthemum lavandulaefolium), are found at the bottom of the valleys.\n\nMany animal species nest in the Alpilles and can be seen in the commune. The most famous is the Bonelli's eagle, a protected species, as well as the Egyptian vulture, the lesser kestrel, and the Eurasian eagle-owl. The arid rocks are home to a species of lizard emblematic of the Alpilles: the ocellated lizard which is also considered threatened and protected.\n\nThere are many mammals in the commune, especially in the valleys. Wild boar abounds and its population is growing. Conversely, the number of hares and rabbits have tended to decrease. The reason seems to be the outbreak of myxomatosis in 1953 that caused havoc in the population, and, since the end of the 20th century, Rabbit haemorrhagic disease causing the decline of the species. The scarcity of these animals could pose longer-term problems for the survival of species of birds of prey that feed on them.\n\nDemographics\nIn 2017 the commune had 355 inhabitants.\n\nEconomy\n\nOlive growing sector\n\nThe commune produces Olive oil of the valley of Les Baux-de-Provence which is protected by the appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e (AOC) by a decree issued by INAO on 27 August 1997. The olive varieties that go into its preparation are: Salonenque, B\u00e9ruguette, Grossane, and Verdale of Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne. Crushed olives and black olives are also produced that fall under the INAO decree. The varieties of crushed olives broken are Salonenque and B\u00e9ruguette. For black olives only the variety Grossane is acceptable.\n\nWine production\nThe commune is classified AOC for its Coteaux-des-baux-en-provence wines. This AOC was created by decree on 20 April 1995 for red and ros\u00e9 wines. They were first classified VDQS by an order of 23 January 1956 for Coteaux-d'aix-en-provence. A second decree dated 24 December 1985 allowed the use of the generic name Les Baux recognizing the specific identity of the vineyards of the Baux region covering seven communes in the Alpilles. Production is 15,500 hectolitres per year: 75% red and 25% ros\u00e9.\n\nCulture\n\nChristmas at Baux in the Church of Saint Vincent is held on Christmas Eve during midnight mass. This is primarily a live nativity scene, which takes place before the pastorage ritual developed in the pastoral world and dating back to the 16th century. This traditional ceremony was abandoned during the 19th century but was revived in 1902: a cart pulled by a ram, decorated with leaves and candles, brings a newborn lamb. Each shepherd, in turn, kisses the feet of the child Jesus then passes the lamb hand to hand before giving an offering.\n\nCarri\u00e8res de Lumi\u00e8res, established in 1976 as the Cath\u00e9drale d'Images, is a permanent show in which large bright images are projected on the stone walls of huge galleries dug into the rock of the Val d'Enfer on the road to Maillane. The wall surface used extends over 4,000 m2. Cath\u00e9drale d'Images is a fairy and giant slide show in the dark projected on the limestone walls of the quarry where the viewer is immersed in a visual and musical universe. Despite its success the Cath\u00e9drale d'images had to stop its activities in Baux-de-Provence at the end of 2010 after refusing a Public Service Delegation. The municipal council then entrusted the management of the site to the Culturespaces company who operate under the name of Carri\u00e8res de Lumi\u00e8res.\n\nExhibitions \n\nIn 2019, Stefan Szczesny exhibited in the whole village of Les Baux-de-Provence. The German artist, living in Saint-Tropez showed about 30 of his monumental \"shadow sculptures\" as well as glass sculptures from Murano, ceramics and paintings.\n\nFilming location\n\n The End of the Day (1938)\n Testament of Orpheus (1959)\n Maniac (1963)\n Dead Tired (1994)\n Ronin (1998)\n The Amazing Race (2001; 2017)\n Days of Glory (2006)\n Chanel Cruise 2021/22 Fashion Show (2021)\n\nSee also\n Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne, department\n Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur, region\n\nReferences\n\nCitations\n\nBibliography\n\n L.

He also won international poetry prizes, and was nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nBiography\nYehuda Amichai was born in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, to an Orthodox Jewish family, and was raised speaking both Hebrew and German. His German name was Ludwig Pfeuffer.\n\nAmichai immigrated with his family at the age of eleven to Petah Tikva in Mandate Palestine in 1935, moving to Jerusalem in 1936. He attended Ma'aleh, a religious high school in Jerusalem. He was a member of the Palmach, the strike force of the Haganah, the defense force of the Jewish community in Mandate Palestine. As a young man he volunteered and fought in World War II as a soldier in the British Army, and in the Negev on the southern front in the 1947\u20131949 Palestine war.\n\nAfter discharge from the British Army in 1946, Amichai was a student at David Yellin Teachers College in Jerusalem, and became a teacher in Haifa. After the 1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War, Amichai studied the Torah and Hebrew literature at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Encouraged by one of his professors at Hebrew University, he published his first book of poetry, Now and in Other Days, in 1955.\n\nIn 1956, Amichai served in the Sinai War, and in 1973 he served in the Yom Kippur War. Amichai published his first novel, Not of This Time, Not of This Place, in 1963. It is about a young Israeli who was born in Germany; after World War II, and the 1947\u20131949 Palestine war, he visits his hometown in Germany and recalls his childhood, trying to make sense of the world that created the Holocaust. His second novel, Mi Yitneni Malon, about an Israeli poet living in New York, was published in 1971 while Amichai was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. He was a poet in residence at New York University in 1987. For many years he taught literature in an Israeli seminar for teachers, and at the Hebrew University to students from abroad.\n\nAmichai was invited in 1994 by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin to read from his poems at the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. \"God Has Pity on Kindergarten Children\" was one of the poems he read. This poem is inscribed on a wall in the Rabin Museum in Tel Aviv. There are streets named for him in cities in Israel, and also one in W\u00fcrzburg.\n\nAmichai was married twice. He was first married to Tamar Horn, with whom he had one son, and then to Chana Sokolov; they had one son and one daughter. His two sons were Ron and David, and his daughter was Emmanuella.\n\nAmichai died of cancer in 2000, at age 76.\n\nPoetry \nAmichai's poetry deals with issues of day-to-day life, and with philosophical issues of the meaning of life and death. His work is characterized by gentle irony and original, often surprising imagery. Like many secular Israeli poets, he struggles with religious faith. His poems are full of references to God and the religious experience. He was described as a philosopher-poet in search of a post-theological humanism.\n\nAmichai has been credited with a \"rare ability for transforming the personal, even private, love situation, with all its joys and agonies, into everybody's experience, making his own time and place general.\"\n\nSome of his imagery was accused of being sacrilegious. In his poem \"And this is Your Glory\" (Vehi Tehilatekha), for example, God is sprawled under the globe like a mechanic under a car, futilely trying to repair it. In the poem \"Gods Change, Prayers Stay the Same\" (Elim Mithalfim, ha-Tfillot Nisharot la-Ad), God is a portrayed as a tour guide or magician.\n\nMany of Amichai's poems were set to music in Israel and in other countries. Among them:\nthe poem Memorial Day for the War Dead was set to music for solo voices, chorus and orchestra in Mohammed Fairouz's Third Symphony.\nOther poems were set by the composers Elizabeth Alexander (\"Even a fist was once an open palm and fingers\"), David Froom, Matthias Pintscher, Jan Du\u0161ek, Benjamin Wallfisch, Ayelet Rose Gottlieb, Maya Beiser, Elizabeth Swados, Daniel Asia and others.\n\nLanguage and poetic style \nIn an interview published in the American Poetry Review, Amichai spoke about his command of Hebrew:\n\nI grew up in a very religious household ... So the prayers, the language of prayer itself became a kind of natural language for me ... I don't try\u2014like sometimes poets do\u2014to 'enrich' poetry by getting more cultural material or more ethnic material into it. It comes very naturally.\n\nRobert Alter describes Amichai's poetry as a \"play of sound\". He \"builds a strong momentum that moves in free association from word to word, the sounds virtually generating the words that follow in the syntactic chain through phonetic kinship\".\n\nAmichai's work was popular in English translation, but admirers of his poetry in the original Hebrew claim his innovative use of the language is lost in translation. Subtle layers of meaning achieved using an ancient word rather than its modern synonym to impart a biblical connotation cannot always be conveyed. In Amichai's love poem In the Middle of This Century, for instance, the English translation reads: \"the linsey-woolsey of our being together\". The Hebrew term, shaatnez, refers to the biblical taboo on interweaving linen and wool, which a Hebrew reader would grasp as an image of forbidden union.\n\nLiterary work \nAmichai traced his beginnings as a poetry lover to when he was stationed with the British army in Egypt. There he happened to find an anthology of modern British poetry, and the works of Dylan Thomas, T. S. Eliot, and W. H. Auden. That book inspired his first thoughts about becoming a writer.\n\nLiterary scholar Boaz Arpaly wrote about the influence of biography on Amichai's poetry: \"Literary criticism made the determination long ago that despite the autobiographical character of Amichai's poetry, the individual depicted in it is the typical Israeli everyman, and even in a wider sense, the individual as an individual of the twentieth century (a poetics that interweaves the private with the typically generic) ... Amichai routinely conflates biographical details from different times into one poetic framework, and exploits drafts and poetic ideas that were recorded in different periods, for a poem that would be written years later.\" \"Almost every poem by Amichai is a statement about the general human condition and Amichai, in a certain sense, is always a philosophical poet.\"\n\nHe changed his name to Yehuda Amichai (\"my people lives\") around 1946. In her biography of Amichai, literary critic Nili Scharf Gold writes that the idea for the name change, as well as the name \"Amichai\", came from his girlfriend, Ruth Herrmann, who later moved to the United States and married Eric Zielenziger. Contrary to Gold's claim, Amichai said in an interview that it was his idea to choose the name Amichai: \"it was common at that time to change (foreign) names into Hebrew names ... 'Amichai' was a right name, because it was Socialist, Zionist and optimistic.\"\n\nGold also believes that a childhood trauma in Germany affected Amichai's later poetry. She claims in her book that Amichai had an argument with a childhood friend, Ruth Hanover, which led to her cycling home angrily. Ruth was caught in a traffic accident, as a result of which she had to have a leg amputated, and Gold claims that Amichai felt guilt and responsibility. Ruth later was murdered in the Holocaust. Amichai occasionally referred to her in his poems as \"Little Ruth\".\n\nIn an interview Amichai said: \"Little Ruth is my Anne Frank\".  \"I found out that she (Little Ruth) was in the last transport in 1944. This knowledge goes with me all the time, not because of guilt.\" \"If there is any guilty feeling it's like the guilt that soldiers feel when they survive the battle while their friends were killed.\"\n\nRobert Alter wrote about Gold's contention: \"Again and again Gold asks why Amichai did not represent his German childhood in his poetry, except fragmentarily and obliquely. The inconvenient fact that his major novel, Not of This time, Not of This Place, devotes elaborate attention to W\u00fcrzburg (which is given the fictional name Weinburg) is not allowed to trouble Gold's thesis of suppression, because the book is fiction, not poetry, and hence is thought somehow to belong to a different category in regard to the writer's relation to his early years. But Gold's notion of Amichai's 'poetics of camouflage' rests on an entirely unexamined assumptionthat it is the task of the poet to represent his life directly and in full ...\" However, Gold argued that Amichai only wrote extensively about W\u00fcrzburg in his novel because it was not his primary genre and therefore would be read by fewer people. Moreover, Not of This Time, Not of This Place does not hide the fact that it is based on Amichai's autobiography, including both his trip to his former hometown (and, explicitly, his search for closure about Little Ruth) and his affair with an American woman.\n\nContrary to Gold's argument, Amichai wrote many plays and radio plays, a book of short stories, and a second novel, and he never said or wrote in any interview that he hoped that fewer people would read his prose.\n\nBoaz Arpaly wrote: \"Amichai did not hide in his poetry the fact that he was an immigrant and a son of immigrants, but he chose to tell the story of his childhood in his hometown, in his novel Not of This Time, Not of This Place, and like any other writer, he decided which material of his life will become material to his poetry...\"\n\nDid Amichai want to become a national poet? ... his poetry embodied a silent but piercing revolution against the social and political institutions that enslave the life and happiness of the individual for their need \u2013 He should bother so much to build for himself the mythology of a national poet? All the things that Gold thinks he was hiding were not in any contrast to the unique \"nationality\" embodied in his poetry. I did not find in Gold's book an explanation to the concept 'national poet' but in the first place, this concept appears in her book she is pointing to my article (1997) that says: \"of all the poets who began to at the time of Amichai, or in later years, since Alterman there was not a poet more popular than Amichai. In this he is unique. He is probably the only canonic poet read by so many, also by people that do not belong to the Literary Community. In this matter he has no rivals. From this aspect, at least, he may be considered a national poet, a title that does not suit him from any other point of view ...\" Gold's use of that title is not clear and not responsible.\n\nCritical acclaim \nAmichai's poetry in English appeared in the first issue of Modern Poetry in Translation, edited by Daniel Weissbort and Ted Hughes in 1965. In 1966 he appeared at the Spoleto poetry festival with Ezra Pound, W.H. Auden, Pablo Neruda and others. In 1968, he appeared at the London Poetry Festival. His first book in English, Selected Poems (1968), was translated by Assia Guttman (Hughes' lover and mother to his daughter Shura). Referring to him as \"the great Israeli poet\", Jonathan Wilson wrote in The New York Times that he is, \"one of very few contemporary poets to have reached a broad cross-section without compromising his art. He was loved by his readers worldwide.\"\n\nIn the Times Literary Supplement, Ted Hughes wrote: \"I've become more than ever convinced that Amichai is one of the biggest, most essential, most durable poetic voices of this past century \u2013 one of the most intimate, alive and human, wise, humorous, true, loving, inwardly free and resourceful, at home in every human situation. One of the real treasures.\"\n\nIn The American Poetry Review, May\u2013June 2016, David Biespiel wrote: \"He translates the hardness of existence into new tenderness; tenderness into spiritual wonder that is meant to quiet outrage; and outrage into a mixture of worry and love and warmth ... He is one of the great joyful lamenters of all time, endlessly documenting his anguish, throbbing pains, mistaken dreams, shortages of faith, abundances of ecstatic loves, and humiliations. And, like everyone else, he wants everything both ways. In particular, he wants to be a lover and a loner, a guy in the street and an intellectual, believer and infidel, while insisting that all manifestations of war against the human spirit be mercilessly squashed.\"\n\nAnthony Hecht said in 2000 that Open Closed Open \"is as deeply spiritual a poem as any I have read in modern times, not excluding Eliot's Four Quartets, or anything to be found in the works of professional religionists. It is an incomparable triumph. Be immediately assured that this does not mean devoid of humor, or without a rich sense of comedy.\". And:  \"not only superb, but would, all by itself, have merited a Nobel Prize.\"\n\nAuthor Nicole Krauss has said that she was affected by Amichai from a young age.\n\nAmichai's poetry has been translated into 40 languages.\n\nAwards and honours \n 1957 \u2013 Shlonsky Prize\n 1969 \u2013 Brenner Prize\n 1976 \u2013 Bialik Prize for literature (co-recipient with essayist Yeshurun Keshet)\n 1981 \u2013 W\u00fcrzburg's Prize for Culture (Germany)\n 1982 \u2013 Israel Prize for Hebrew poetry. The prize citation reads, in part: \"Through his synthesis of the poetic with the everyday, Yehuda Amichai effected a revolutionary change in both the subject matter and the language of poetry.\"\n 1986 \u2013 Agnon Prize\n 1994 \u2013 Malraux Prize: International Book Fair (France)\n 1994 \u2013 Literary Lion Award (New York)\n 1995 \u2013 Macedonia's Golden Wreath Award: International Poetry Festival\n 1996 \u2013 Norwegian Bjornson Poetry Award\n\nAmichai received an Honor Citation from Assiut University, Egypt, and numerous honorary doctorates. He became an Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (1986), and a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (1991). His work is included in the \"100 Greatest Works of Modern Jewish Literature\" (2001), and in international anthologies Poems for the Millennium by J. Rothenberg and P. Joris, and 100 Great Poems of the 20th Century by Mark Strand. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize several times, but never won. Tufts University English professor Jonathan Wilson wrote, \"He should have won the Nobel Prize in any of the last 20 years, but he knew that as far as the Scandinavian judges were concerned, and whatever his personal politics, which were indubitably on the dovish side, he came from the wrong side of the stockade.\"\n\nAmichai Archive \nAmichai sold his archive for over $200,000 to the Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library of Yale University. The archive contains 1,500 letters received from the early 1960s to the early 1990s from dozens of Israeli writers, poets, intellectuals and politicians. Overseas correspondence includes letters from Ted Hughes, Arthur Miller, Erica Jong, Paul Celan, and many others. The archive also includes dozens of unpublished poems, stories and plays; 50 notebooks and notepads with 1,500 pages of notes, poems, thoughts and drafts from the 1950s onward; and the poet's diaries, which he kept for 40 years. According to Moshe Mossek, former head of the Israel State Archive, these materials offer priceless data about Amichai's life and work.\n\nWorks in other languages\n\nEnglish\n The Poetry of Yehuda Amichai.

Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns.\n\nHowever, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed.\n\nDesign\nThe Cannone da 381/40 AVS started life as four Cannone da 381/40 naval guns which were intended to arm Dreadnought battleships of the Francesco Caracciolo-class of the Regia Marina but were made surplus when that class of ship was canceled. Three different guns were ordered for evaluation from Schneider-Ansaldo, Armstrong-Pozzuoli, and Vickers-Terni for the Francesco Caracciolo project. Although the construction of the guns differed they had nearly identical ballistic performance. The guns from Armstrong-Pozzuoli, and Vickers-Terni were wire wound guns while the Schneider-Ansaldo guns were of monobloc construction. The wire wound guns weighed  while the monbloc guns only weighed .  The Schneider-Ansaldo guns were chosen for conversion to railway guns. The guns used interrupted screw breeches and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. It fired high explosive shells weighing  to ranges of  respectively. It also fired a  armor-piercing shell to a range of .  The guns were fed from an attached ammunition wagon with an elevated ammunition trough between the carriages.\n\nThe carriages consisted of a large rectangular steel base, which was suspended on three articulated rail bogies with two four-axle bogies at the front and one six-axle bogie at the rear similar to French Schneider gun carriages of the period. This asymmetric layout was less common and was chosen because the barrel was trunnioned well to the rear and a large counterweight was added to the breech to try and balance the preponderance of the barrel which was towards the front of the carriage.  The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle.  Due to this nose heaviness the guns were only capable of +25\u00b0 of elevation. The guns used a combination of cradle recoil with four hydraulic buffers above and two pneumatic recuperators below the barrel and sliding recoil for the carriage. The carriage only had a limited amount of traverse +1\u00b0 L/R controlled by the rear bogie so it was aimed by drawing the guns across a section of curved track. Once in firing position, a section of rail bed was reinforced with wood and iron beams to support the weight of the gun. Six wooden beams under the center of the carriage were then lowered to lay across the tracks and the carriage was jacked up to take the weight off the bogies and anchor the gun in place.  When the gun fired the entire carriage recoiled a few feet and was stopped by the friction of the beams on the tracks. The carriage was then lowered onto its axles and was either pushed back into place with a shunting locomotive or a windlass mounted on the front of the carriage pulled the carriage back into position. This cheap, simple and effective system came to characterize Schneider's railway guns during the later war years and is known as the Glissement system.\n\nWorld War One\nThe four Cannone da 381/40 AVS entered service at the beginning of 1917 and were first used during the Battle of Caporetto.  The four guns were placed in storage at La Spezia between the wars and were not mobilized during World War II.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences \n\n380 mm artillery\nGio.

According to a 2017 feature about him on the Alabama website AL.com, he is \"arguably the greatest guitarist Alabama ever produced.\"\n\nPerkins may be best known for his work with The Rolling Stones, who almost brought him into the band. However, he has contributed his skills to a long roster of high-profile artists, including Bob Marley and Joni Mitchell.\n\nEarly life and family \nPerkins was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He is the oldest of six children, a brother and four sisters. Both of his parents sang and played guitar. Perkins taught himself to play at age 12.\n\nMusic career\n\nEarly years as a session guitarist \nAt 15, Perkins played his first gig as a session musician, in Bob Grove's Prestige Recording Studio in Birmingham. At 16, he left school and started performing in local bands and released singles with a band called the Vikings with Charles Nettles.\n\nIn 1968, drummer Jasper Guarino helped Perkins land a steady job as a session guitarist in a studio owned by Quin Ivy called \"Quinvy's\" in Muscle Shoals.  Perkins was salaried at $100 a week. This led to work at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio with such names as David Porter and the Soul Children, Dave Crawford and Brad Shapiro, Dee Dee Warwick, Ronnie Milsap, Joe Cocker, Leon Russell, Jimmy Cliff, Jim Capaldi, Steve Winwood and Marlin Greene.\n\nDuring his time at Muscle Shoals, Perkins was asked to join Lynyrd Skynyrd. Even though that band's lead singer, Ronnie Van Zant, was a very close friend, Perkins did not take the offer, though he came close. He later said, \"They didn't need me and I had a lot of other stuff coming my way.\"\n\nWith Smith Perkins Smith \nPerkins left session work to form a band called Smith Perkins Smith, which recorded an album released in 1972. Chris Blackwell signed the trio to Island Records and they became the label's first American act. The group toured in England with Free, as well as Fairport Convention, Argent, Uriah Heep, Family, and Vinegar Joe with Robert Palmer.\n\nWith the Wailers \nWhile in Kingston in the Island Basing Street recording studios, Perkins had been working on the second Smith Perkins Smith album for Island when Chris Blackwell stopped him. \"He said there was a Wailer project he wanted me to play on\" \u2013 Catch a Fire, the 1973 album by Bob Marley and the Wailers, which went platinum. Perkins provided lead guitar overdubs on three tracks on Catch a Fire: \"Concrete Jungle,\" \"Stir It Up,\" and \"Baby We've Got a Date.\" \"His contributions to the pioneering LP weren't actually mentioned on the original liner notes \u2014 indeed most listeners assumed they were hearing Peter Tosh \u2014 but Perkins received credit later.\"\n\nWith Joni Mitchell \nMitchell's 1974 album Court and Spark has often been called a \"classic\" or \"masterpiece.\" Perkins was an ingredient in the musical backdrop for her songs. Sounds magazine cited his \"oh-so-beautiful guitar work\" on \"Car on a Hill\". Perkins later recalled using James Burton's signature pink paisley Telecaster for that recording. He and Mitchell also were involved romantically for a time.\n\nWith Leon Russell \nWhen Perkins returned to the United States, he played with Leon Russell for two years, in the Shelter People Band and the Gap Band. During this time, he became friends with superstar guitarist Eric Clapton.\n\nWith the Rolling Stones \nClapton arranged for Perkins to audition with The Rolling Stones. As a result, Perkins was one of several guitarists hired to play on the album Black and Blue. The credits for the album list Perkins appearing on three tracks: \"Hand of Fate\", \"Memory Motel,\" and \"Fool to Cry.\" \"Worried About You\" was also recorded during these sessions but was not released until 1981 on Tattoo You.\n\nIn his memoir Life, Keith Richards said that Perkins was very nearly asked to replace Mick Taylor in the Stones. \"We liked Perkins a lot. He was a lovely player...[but] it wasn't so much the playing, when it came down to it. It came down to the fact that Ronnie (Ron Wood) was English!\"\n\nSubsequent endeavors \nFollowing this, Perkins joined the Alabama Power Band (formed by his brother Dale), which became Crimson Tide and recorded two albums.\n\nIn Nashville, Perkins wrote music for Catdaddy Music and co-wrote soundtracks with Emmy Award winning composer/producer/remixer Richard Wolf for films including The Karate Kid Part II and Back to School.\n\nPerkins later formed the band Problem Child with Robert Nix and Rick Christian, and played bass with Lonnie Mack.\n\nDuring his long career, Perkins played session guitar with artists including the Alabama State Troupers, Ben Atkins, Michael Bolton, Angela Bofill, the Everly Brothers, the Oak Ridge Boys, Billy Ray Cyrus, Ray Reach and many others.\n\nIn 1995, Perkins recorded his first solo album, Mendo Hotel. In 2005, he released his latest, Ramblin' Heart.\n\nLater life \nSome time later, Wayne Perkins was diagnosed with multiple brain tumors. He was treated, but occasionally suffers from crippling headaches. He retired to Argo, where he lives with his brother.\n\nDiscography \n\n1971 Hills of Indiana  Lonnie Mack ; Living by the Days  Don Nix ; Lovejoy Albert King; Mary Called Jeanie Greene; Ronnie Milsap Ronnie Milsap\n1972 Alabama State Troupers Road Show  Alabama State Troupers; Dinnertime Alex Taylor; Catch a Fire Bob Marley & The Wailers; John David Souther John David Souther; Raised on Records P.F.

Bartow (born Francis Stebbins Bartow; September 6, 1816 \u2013 July 21, 1861) was a licensed attorney turned politician, serving two terms in the United States House of Representatives and becoming a political leader of the Confederate States of America. Bartow was also a colonel in the Georgia Militia commanding the 21st Oglethorpe Light Infantry during the early months of the American Civil War. Bartow was a delegate from Georgia's 1st congressional district to the Southern Convention in Montgomery, Alabama becoming an inaugurating member of the Confederate Provisional Congress\u2014leading efforts to prepare local forces in the aftermath of secession, protracting into The American Civil War of 1861\u201365.\n\nColonel Bartow was killed at the First Battle of Manassas, becoming the first brigade commander of the Confederate States Army to die in combat.\n\nEarly life and career\nFrancis Bartow was born September 6, 1816, in Chatham County, Georgia, near the county seat of Savannah (formerly Georgia's state capital), to Dr. Theodosius Bartow and Frances Lloyd (Stebbins) Bartow. He studied law at the Franklin College of Arts and Sciences in Athens (the founding college of the University of Georgia). While at Franklin, Bartow was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society and was mentored by John M. Berrien, a U.S. senator and former Attorney General in Andrew Jackson's administration. Bartow graduated cum laude in 1835 at age 19. Bartow was an intern under the tutelage of Messrs. Berrien & Law at their Savannah law office. Bartow obtained his postgraduate education at Yale Law School in Connecticut, returning to Savannah in 1837. Bartow was subsequently employed by the Bryan Superior Court and admitted to the State Bar of Georgia soon after his return to Savannah. He joined the locally known law firm of Law & Lovell, becoming a partner and forming Law, Bartow and Lovell, Bartow became regarded for his skills, handling difficult criminal cases.\n\nIn 1840, the 24-year-old Bartow campaigned for William Henry Harrison, the Whig candidate for President. In 1841, he began his own political career by serving the first of two consecutive terms in the Georgia House of Representatives, followed by one term in the Georgia Senate. In 1844, Bartow married Louisa Greene Berrien, the daughter of one of his previous professional tutors, Sen. John Berrien. In 1856, Bartow was a candidate for the U.S. Congress but was defeated. The following year, he was elected as captain of Savannah's 21st Oglethorpe Light Infantry, a reserve guard company that had been formed in 1856. He served as an instructor to the volunteers, many of which were young scions of established families in local society.\n\nAs the national controversy over slavery intensified, Bartow became concerned for Georgia's destiny if war became a reality. In 1860, after Abraham Lincoln's election, he spurned the Union to advocate the right of secession.\n\nAmerican Civil War\n\nSecession and Fort Pulaski\n\nThe Georgia General Assembly summoned delegates to a Secession Convention in Milledgeville which began January 16, 1861\u2014with Bartow nominated for Chatham County's delegation. On May 28, 1861, elections were held to select representatives to the convention, and Bartow emerged as a delegate, along with John W. Anderson and A. S. Jones. Bartow however, was on military duty that day as Governor Joseph E. Brown had previously given orders to retake Fort Pulaski (located near the mouth of the Savannah River)\u2014recently garrisoned by Federal military forces. Brown entrusted the task to Bartow and the Oglethorpe Light Infantry. Bartow's expedition successfully occupied the fort on June 15, largely due to his artillery under Col. Alexander Lawton.\n\nAt the convention, Bartow stood out as one of the most fervent secessionists. Demanding an immediate withdrawal from the Union, he helped align Georgia among the pro-secessionist states. On January 19, 1861, delegates voted to secede from the Union by a vote of 208 to 89. Bartow was a delegate in favor of secession, voting to sign Georgia's Ordinance of Secession on that day. The actual signing of the ordinance occurred on January 21, 1861, when the delegates ceremoniously signed the document in the public square outside of the state capitol in Milledgeville. Bartow was subsequently chosen to represent Georgia in the Provisional Congress of the Confederate States at Montgomery, Alabama, starting February 4, 1861.\n\nOn the second day of the Congress, Bartow became chairman of the Military Committee. He helped select the color and style of the initial Confederate gray uniforms. During a later session, Bartow announced that he would depart for the battlefront, taking his Oglethorpe Light Infantry up to Virginia. As he explained later on:\n\nDispute with Governor Brown\nBartow telegraphed the news to his Georgia troops, arranging a prompt rally. However, his plans were blocked by Governor Brown, who had already decided to concentrate the state's armed forces strictly for the defense of Georgia. Bartow appealed personally to the Confederate President, Jefferson Davis, using a new law authored by Louis T. Wigfall of Texas that authorized any citizen to offer any voluntary military force directly, without state mediation, to the Confederate President, who would also determine its military leader. Davis immediately approved Bartow's plan and designated him the commander of the new Confederate force, making Bartow's Oglethorpe Light Infantry the first company to officially contribute its services to the Confederacy's national war effort.\n\nAn angry Governor Brown countered by publishing an aggressively tough letter in all Georgia newspapers on May 21, 1861. Among other things, he alleged that Bartow was seeking his own glory by assuring a high command and aspiring to a promotion to colonel. To him, Bartow was actually deserting the war \"to serve the common cause in a more pleasant summer climate.\" He wrote that the muskets Bartow's men had carried to Virginia were exclusively for local \"public service,\"  and that the Governor had the power of disarming the local military companies arbitrarily. He also alleged that Bartow had written the law beforehand, tailoring it for his own plans and forcing Davis to ignore the authority of the Confederacy's \"independent\" states. In Brown's opinion, the governor was Bartow's unique officer by the Confederate Constitution. He argued that the Congress was encroaching Georgia's rights.\n\nNonetheless, Bartow arrived in Savannah on May 21 to assemble his 106 soldiers and to arrange for a train to take them to Virginia's battlefront. A great rally of cheerful citizens congregated at the station, accompanied by the remaining local militia, which fired an artillery salute in Bartow's honor. Before departing, Bartow pronounced to the crowd his most celebrated phrase: \"I go to illustrate Georgia.\"\n\nOn June 14, from Camp Defiance in Harper's Ferry, Bartow wrote his response to the \"insolent missive\" of Brown, who \"thought proper to publish [it] in [Bartow's] absence\". The response was published in the Savannah Morning News. Bartow defended himself vehemently, countering each of the personalized attacks and stating that he had undertaken the current campaign under the sole command of Jefferson Davis. His recurring argument was that the \"Confederate Government is alone chargeable with questions of peace and war and has the exclusive right, excepting in the case of invasion, to raise and maintain armies\" while the Governors are not \"empowered to raise these armies\". Brown would have been committing, \"here again, [his] common error, of supposing that [he was] the State of Georgia .... a mistake in which I do not participate.\"\n\nManassas\nBartow's 21st Oglethorpe Light Infantry finally arrived in Richmond, Virginia, with the objective of protecting the region from any Union attack. On June 1, 1861, Bartow was promoted to Colonel of the 8th Georgia Infantry, which had been formed in Virginia from companies that had been arriving from different Georgia counties. Later that day, he mustered the regiment for the first time at Camp Bartow in Howard's Grove in Richmond. The regiment was initially assigned to the Shenandoah Valley. Crossing the Virginia Piedmont, it arrived in Winchester, near the northern end of the valley. Once settled, Bartow incorporated some local forces from the 2nd Brigade of the Army of the Shenandoah.\n\nLate in June 1861, Bartow received orders to move his troops to the outskirts of Manassas to support General P. G. T. Beauregard. They departed on June 19, fording the Shenandoah River with their \"luggage tied on the ends of [their] fixed bayonets.\" After reaching the Piedmont station, the regiment was transported to Manassas by train. \t\n\nBartow commanded the 7th & 8th Georgia Regiments\u2014the 9th Georgia Regiment, Pope's and Duncan's Kentucky Battalions Infantry remained at Piedmont Station and were not present on July 21, 1861. He addressed his troops, \"... but remember, boys, that battle and fighting mean death, and probably before sunrise, some of us will be dead.\" Early the next morning, Bartow had the 7th and 8th Georgia march to the left flank of the army.\n\nAfter the fighting had started, the two regiments reached Henry House Hill, where they were joined by Bartow, after one of his soldiers confirmed that it was his regiment: \"Boys, what Regiment is this?\" The response came, \"8th Georgia.\" He answered, \"My God, boys, I am mighty glad to see you.\" He deployed his brigade on the hill alongside Brigadier-General Barnard Bee's brigade. Bee then decided to go forward to support Evan's brigade on Matthew Hill as Evans had rejected his suggestion to fall back to Henry Hill. Bartow deployed the 7th and 8th Georgia into line of battle to support the right flank of Bee's Brigade.\n\nAs the hours went on, Bartow's soldiers were gradually worn down by the enemy. At times, they found themselves completely encircled, the target of a spate of bullets. One of the survivors later wrote, \"Practically half of the Eighth's 1,000 Georgians fell dead or wounded, or were captured or lost ... Bartow led his men to an exposed eminence which was too hot to hold.\"\n\nBartow (now with less than 400 men) was forced to retreat about noontime back to his original deployment site. There, he asked General Beauregard, \"What shall now be done? Tell me, and if human efforts can avail, I will do it.\" Waving at the enemy position on the Stone Bridge, Beauregard replied, \"That battery should be silenced.\" Bartow gathered the remainder of the 7th Regiment and launched another attack. Around Henry House Hill, Bartow's horse was shot out from under him and a bullet wounded him slightly. Nonetheless, he grabbed another horse and continued the attack.\n\nAt one point, he harangued his troops to follow him toward the enemy by cheering \"Boys, follow me!\" and waving his cap frantically over his head. Just then, another projectile perforated his chest, fatally lodging in his heart. Some of his soldiers gathered around him, witnessing his last words: \"Boys, they have killed me, but never give up the field.\" Lying on the ground and wrapped in Col. Lucius Gartrell's arms, Francis Bartow died. He was the first brigade commander to be killed in action during the Civil War. (The first general officer to be killed in the war was Confederate Brig. Gen. Robert S. Garnett at Corrick's Ford, July 13, 1861.) Amos Rucker and his brother Moses Bentley, two body servants from the 7th Regiment, carried Bartow off the battlefield. The renowned surgeon H. V. M. Miller attended him, but without success.\n\nThe rest of Bartow's 7th Georgia continued to obey his last command to attack. The Union forces were beginning to show fatigue, due to their having been weakened during Bartow's morning attack. The Confederates sustained their attack until finally destroying the enemy battery at Stone Bridge. General Beauregard declared, \"You Georgians saved me,\" though the Georgia Rome Weekly Courier newspaper commented, \"Col. Bartow's fine Regiment of Georgians were nearly annihilated\".\n\nWhen notified of Bartow's death, the Provisional Congress adjourned its sessions \"in testimony of [its] respect for his memory\", as expressed by its spokesman, T. R. R. Cobb. The chamber felt an \"unfeigned sorrow\" due to the \"heavy loss sustained by the Confederacy in the death of one of her most efficient counselors.\" They did confirm Bartow's posthumous rank of acting brigadier general.\n\nOn July 27, 1861, Bartow's corpse returned to Chatham County, Georgia. Accompanied by an extensive popular rally, Bartow was buried at Laurel Grove Cemetery with a military ceremony. Louisa Berrien received a consoling letter from Mrs. Jefferson Davis. His granite monument has two of his historical phrases engraved under a wreath and a saber: \"I go to illustrate Georgia\" and \"They have killed me, boys, but never give up.\"\n\nMemorialization\n\nManassas battlefield\n\nAfter the battle, on the approximate spot where Bartow was killed, Confederate soldiers placed a small stone landmark (engraved in Savannah) which quoted his last words: \"My God, boys, they have got me, but never give up the field.\" This memorial stone was later removed by Union forces during one of their raids. (Two markers survive on that same site in the present-day National Battlefield\u2014an older one placed by veterans of the 7th Georgia in 1903, and a newer bronze marker erected in the 20th century.)\n\nOn September 4, 1861, before a crowd of 1,000 people, the first Confederate-dedicated monument was inaugurated at Manassas, honoring Francis Bartow. An obelisk made of marble, it was mysteriously stolen in 1862. In 1936, in an attempt to repair this vandalism, a new marker was placed at the same site by the Georgia Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy. A new monument of Bartow exists nearby, several feet from the original one.\n\nSavannah's monument\n\nAfter years of postponement due to the war and its effects, on February 7, 1890, the Savannah City Council approved erecting a memorial recognizing native sons Francis Bartow and Lafayette McLaws. Unveiled in 1902, their two bronze busts were mounted on stone pedestals at Chippewa Square. Bartow's faced south towards Perry Street, while McLaws' faced north. About 1910, the council decided to build the Oglethorpe Monument at Chippewa Square. Both generals' busts were therefore relocated to the Confederate Monument at Forsyth Park.\n\nBartow is buried in Savannah's Laurel Grove Cemetery.\n\nBartow namesakes\nBartow County, Georgia\nBartow, Georgia\nBartow, Florida\nBartow, West Virginia\nBartow Elementary School, a school in Savannah which opened in 1963.

Along with a big on-road market, there are several grocery shops and general stores across the village.\n\nThere are many mohallas/muhallas (districts or neighborhoods) in the village, namely Thakur Dwara, Bazaar Tola, Kanchan Khera, Mela, Mahua Bagh, Pajawa, Koriyayi, Diha, Singhaniya, Mahamayin, and Chamrahiya.\n\nReferences\n\nVillages in Lucknow district", "The 2006 Nova Scotia general election was held on June 13, 2006 to elect members of the 60th House of Assembly of the Province of Nova Scotia, Canada.\n\nPremier Rodney MacDonald, who led a Progressive Conservative minority government in the legislature, called for the election on May 13, 2006, hoping for a majority government to better advance his agenda and a clear mandate for himself as he had not yet fought an election as leader.\n\nUltimately, MacDonald was returned to power leading another, slightly smaller, minority government against a strengthened New Democratic Party sitting as the Official Opposition and a weakened Liberal Party. Liberal leader Francis MacKenzie was defeated in his riding of Bedford.\n\nTimeline \nSeptember 29, 2005 - Premier John Hamm, leader of the Progressive Conservative minority government, announces his intent to resign as soon as the party chooses a new leader.\nFebruary 11, 2006 - Rodney MacDonald is elected to replace Hamm as leader.\nFebruary 24, 2006 - MacDonald becomes Premier and his cabinet is sworn in.\nMay 9, 2006 - MacDonald's government introduces an \"election-style\" budget in the legislature.\nMay 13, 2006 - Premier Rodney MacDonald calls a general election for June 13, 2006.\n\nCampaign\nMacKenzie was an outspoken critic of the governing Tories and accused them of living in a \"fantasy world\" due to their promise to cut taxes and increase spending in the 2006-07 budget.\n\nNo single issue dominated the election campaign, with all parties offering up various promises for university students to seniors.\n\nResults\n\nThe Progressive Conservatives gained several points in the popular vote, but made a net loss of two seats, with losses to the NDP partially countered by the PCs doubling their representation on MacDonald's native Cape Breton Island at the expense of the Liberals. The gap between the Liberals and NDP also significantly increased, in both the popular vote and seat count; while the Liberals and NDP had previously been nearly even, the NDP gained a significant advantage on the Liberals and moved into position as the primary opposition to the governing PCs.\n\nResults by party\n\n* The Green Party did not contest the 2003 election.\n\nResults by region\n\nRetiring incumbents\nProgressive Conservative\nRon Russell, Hants West\nCecil O'Donnell, Shelburne\nBill Langille, Colchester North\nPeter G.

Led by the Prime Minister, the cabinet is a council of ministers who are accountable collectively to the Parliament. According to the Article 43 of the Federal Constitution, members of the Cabinet can only be selected from members of either houses of Parliament. Formally, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong appoints all Ministers on the advice of the Prime Minister. The constitution is amended by repealing the Clause (8) of Article 43, enabling a person who is a member of State Legislative Assembly to continue to serve even while serving as a minister or deputy minister in the cabinet. Ministers other than the Prime Minister shall hold office during the pleasure of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong, unless the appointment of any Minister shall have been revoked by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on the advice of the Prime Minister but any Minister may resign from office. In practice, the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is obliged to follow the advice of the Prime Minister on the appointment and dismissal of ministers.\n\nCabinet appointments \nMembers of the Cabinet must be members of either house of Parliament. Most ministers are appointed from the lower house, the Dewan Rakyat, although a few are appointed from the upper house, the Dewan Negara. The Prime Minister must be a member of the Dewan Rakyat. Although Deputy Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries may be appointed to each portfolio, they are not included in the Cabinet. The Cabinet meets weekly, every Wednesday. After the position of Parliamentary Secretary was removed and partial live telecasts of Parliament proceedings began in 2008, Cabinet meetings were moved to Fridays whenever Parliament sat, so as to allow Ministers to personally answer questions during Question Time in Parliament.\n\nCabinet composition \nThe composition of the Cabinet, and the number of portfolios depends mainly on the wishes of the Prime Minister at the time. However, the post of Finance Minister was considered so important as to be a necessity, and as a result was incorporated by the Minister of Finance (Incorporation) Act 1957 (Act 375). The position of Deputy Prime Minister is one that exists by convention, and as a result a Prime Minister could theoretically form a Cabinet without a Deputy.\n\nDeputy ministers exist for each portfolio, although they are not considered members of the Cabinet. The position of Deputy Minister was created by constitutional amendment in 1960. The office of parliamentary secretary for each ministry exists but none were appointed after the 2008 Malaysian general election. Parliamentary secretaries were provided for by an amendment in 1963. Deputy ministers and parliamentary secretaries are also appointed from members of Parliament, and deputise for the ministers in government ministries and in Parliament respectively. An additional office, that of the Political Secretary, exists. Political Secretaries need not be members of Parliament. Before taking office, all members of the Cabinet, Deputy Ministers, Parliamentary Secretaries, and Political Secretaries take an oath of secrecy concerning the proceedings of the Cabinet.\n\nFunctions of cabinet \nAn outline of the functions of the Cabinet are as follows:\n\n To formulate national economic policies and development programmes.  \n The Cabinet is responsible to formulate various development programs and projects for the development of the country. Examples are the New Economic Policy (NEP), the National Development Policy (NDP), and the National Vision Policy (NVP).   \n To set the budget and finance of the country.\n The government is allowed to generate revenues from the people through the collection of taxes, fines, summons, custom duties, fees, etc. \n The government is allowed to plan for the various development programs, and also to allocate the resources for these development plans and programs.   \n As an arena for suggestions, debates, and criticisms.\n The Cabinet is allowed to discuss almost any issues of national interests, except those that touch on the special rights of the Malays, Bumiputeras and/or royal privileges. Article 153 (1): It shall be the responsibility of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong to safeguard the special position of the Malays and Natives of any of the States of Sabah and Sarawak, and the legitimate interests of other communities in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n To propose and amend the law.\n Law is proposed by the Executive and introduce in Parliament with the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd readings for approval.\n Most provisions for the amendments of the constitution requires a 2/3 majority of the total number of members from both of the Houses (Dewan Negara and Dewan Rakyat)\n The bill must be presented to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong for the final assent.\n\nList of cabinets \n23 cabinets have taken place in Malaysia since 1957 headed by nine Prime Ministers.\n\nCurrent

Eastern Suburbs backs were particularly smart in making openings, Cubitt moving about in good style whenever an opportunity offered. Norman was also clever In all-round play. The Western Suburbs backs could not get going, though several strong attempts were made. Wright put in a couple of fast runs for Eastern Suburbs without avail. He was well watched, and his centre kicks were blocked. Two long kicks by White drove the ball over the line for a force in each case. Freeman did not appear at all safe at full-back.

Caples was kicking strongly, and several times got his side out of difficult positions. Neither set of backs, how-ever, handled the ball well, but, on the other hand, the tackling was particularly good.

After joining the Corps of Guides as a lieutenant, he transferred to the Royal Flying Corps. He trained in the United Kingdom, and joined No. 34 Squadron at Netheravon. He transferred to No. 34 Squadron, then to No. 24 Squadron in early summer of 1916. On 18 June 1916, on his first combat sortie, he attacked four encroaching Germans and broke up their reconnaissance patrol. He went on to down six Germans, and be shot down twice by ground fire. He became a Flight Commander before March 1917, when he was assigned back in England on Home Establishment. He was awarded the Military Cross on 4 June 1917, and promoted to Major in March 1918.\n\nAfter the war ended, he never again set foot in an airplane. He went on to work for the Canadian National Railway, ending up as Chief of Development. He retired from that post in March 1959. Shortly after joining another firm in Montreal, he died of a heart attack.\n\nReferences\n\n \n\n1894 births\n1959 deaths\nCanadian World War I flying aces\nCanadian recipients of the Military Cross", "John Peter Galanis (born 1943) is an American financier in the 1970s and 1980s, who became a notorious white-collar criminal.  Galanis has four sons and, at the age of 76, is currently incarcerated at Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island in San Pedro, California, after being convicted in 2019 for defrauding a Native American tribal entity and various investment advisory clients of tens of millions of dollars in a  fraudulent and deceptive bond scam.\n\nEarly life\nGalanis was born in the Boston, Massachusetts area and grew up on a farm.\n\nCrimes\n\n1970s\nIn 1971, three investors in a company named Armstrong Investors amended a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in the case of Delfino v. Armstrong Investors S.A., seeking to recover $13.5 million in damages for the alleged weakening of their investment by fraudulent or negligent conduct of Armstrong, its affiliates and partners, including Everest Management Corporation (the investment manager for Armstrong). Galanis was an officer.\n\nUltimately, nine criminal actions were brought for violations of the securities laws. Galanis was charged with looting the securities and cash of domestic and offshore mutual funds and also charged with engaging in a scheme to defraud domestic and foreign mutual funds, and was sentenced to prison.\n\n1980s\n\nOn June 8, 1983, Galanis was charged, along with two former Chase Manhattan Bank vice presidents with stealing $9.5 million from Chase through fraudulent loans in 1978 and 1979. The case was brought by Manhattan District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau.\n\nOn May 12, 1987, Galanis was charged in separate federal and state cases in Manhattan with stealing more than $115 million from investors and cheating the government of millions of dollars in false tax deductions.\nGalanis was promoting a tax shelter. \n \nIn the federal case, as announced by then United States Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani in Manhattan, involved \"a massive racketeering scheme\" with Galanis operating a tax shelter program that obtained about $40 million from about 2,500 investors. Giuliani called Galanis \"a career white-collar criminal.\"\nThe scheme was this: Galanis's company lent the investors $4 for each $1 they invested and told them that they were eligible to deduct four times their actual investment on their taxes. However, the loans were fabricated.\n\nIn the New York state case, Galanis was charged with selling real-estate tax shelters involving the Nashua Trust Company, which was said to be acquiring and developing non-casino hotels in Atlantic City. None of that work ever happened. As many as 1,400 investors entrusted Galanis with $75 million. The cash was used to pay other debts with $6 million going to Galanis's family. Comedic film actor Eddie Murphy was an investor with Galanis.\n\nOn September 16, 1987, a new 58-count Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) indictment was served to Galanis, along with eight others, for a Greenwich, Connecticut-based racketeering enterprise.\n\nHere, Galanis' company took control of three mutual funds in Oakland, California, ISI Trust Fund, ISI Growth Fund, and ISI Income Fund. Galanis was accused of obtaining $3.9 million by selling the funds securities at inflated prices and also fraudulently obtaining control of the Columbia Federal Savings Bank of Westport, Connecticut through lying to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.\n\nOn September 29, 1988, Galanis was ultimately sentenced to 27 years in federal prison for 44 counts of involvement in a racketeering enterprise after being convicted in July 1988, of which he served 13 years.\n\nHe stated at his sentencing: \"My arrogance did not allow me to fully examine the events through another's eyes.  I thought of myself as a kind man, imparting good values, not a racketeer\".\n\n2000s\nIn 2001, Galanis was released from prison on a work release program and disappeared.\n\nIn 2019, he was tried and sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, and is currently incarcerated at Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island in San Pedro, California, after being convicted in 2019 for defrauding a Native American tribal entity and various investment advisory clients of tens of millions of dollars in a  fraudulent and deceptive bond scam.

Khlong Suan Phlu is the old course of the Pa Sak River that begins at Hua Ro, and then turned towards the Hantra River and then pass Wat Phanan Choeng, where it is referred to as the \"Khlong Suan Phlu\". It is a waterway connects the Pa Sak and the Chao Phraya Rivers.\n\nIn the Ayutthaya period, a large number of waterways and ditches were dug. Khlong Suan Phlu (otherwise known as Khlong Phai Ling or Nam Mae Bia) was one of them.\nHistorically, Khlong Suan Phlu area was a large Chinese community. The Chao Phraya River near the canal mouth, it was the location of the houseboats of the Chinese immigrants.

The two countries have a complex and largely hostile relationship that is rooted in a multitude of historical and political events, most notably the partition of British India in August 1947; the India\u2013Pakistan border is one of the most militarised international boundaries in the world. Northern India and most of modern-day Pakistan overlap with each other in terms of their common Indo-Aryan demographic, natively speaking a variety of Indo-Aryan languages (mainly Punjabi, Sindhi, and Hindi\u2013Urdu).\n\nTwo years after World War II, the United Kingdom formally dissolved British India, dividing it into two new sovereign nations: the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. The partitioning of the former British colony resulted in the displacement of up to 15 million people, with the death toll estimated to have reached between several hundred thousand and one million people as scores of Hindus and Muslims migrated in opposite directions across the Radcliffe Line to reach India and Pakistan, respectively. In 1950, India emerged as a secular republic with a Hindu-majority population and a large Muslim minority. Shortly afterwards, in 1956, Pakistan emerged as an Islamic republic with a Muslim-majority population and a large Hindu minority; it later lost most of its Hindu population following its defeat in the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, which saw the secession of East Pakistan as the independent country of Bangladesh.\n\nWhile both countries established full diplomatic ties shortly after their formal independence, their relationship was quickly overshadowed by the mutual effects of the partition as well as by the emergence of conflicting territorial claims over various princely states, with the most significant dispute being that of Jammu and Kashmir. Since 1947, India and Pakistan have fought three major wars and one undeclared war, and have also engaged in numerous armed skirmishes and military standoffs; the Kashmir conflict has served as the catalyst for every war between the two states, with the exception of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, which instead occurred alongside the Bangladesh Liberation War.\n\nThere have been numerous attempts to improve the relationship, notably the Shimla summit, the Agra summit, and the Lahore summit, as well as various peace and co-operation initiatives. Despite those efforts, relations between the countries have remained frigid, following repeated acts of cross-border terrorism. According to a BBC World Service poll in 2017, only 5% of Indians view Pakistan's influence positively, with 85% expressing a negative view, while 11% of Pakistanis view India's influence positively, with 62% expressing a negative view. However, India has successfully dehyphenated itself from Pakistan and has found creative ways and mechanisms to side-step or corner Pakistan in the international community. The \u201cminimalist engagement\u201d allows India to keep \u201ccold peace\u201d with Pakistan and focus on other pressing issues and strategic challenges.\n\nSeeds of conflict during independence\n\nMassive population exchanges occurred between the two newly formed states in the months immediately following the partition. There was no conception that population transfers would be necessary because of the partitioning. Religious minorities were expected to stay put in the states they found themselves residing in. However, while an exception was made for Punjab, where the transfer of populations was organised because of the communal violence affecting the province, this did not apply to other provinces.\n\nThe partition of British India split the former British province of Punjab and Bengal between the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan. The mostly Muslim western part of the province became Pakistan's Punjab province; the mostly Hindu and Sikh eastern part became India's East Punjab state (later divided into the new states of Punjab, Haryana and Himachal Pradesh). Many Hindus and Sikhs lived in the west, and many Muslims lived in the east, and the fears of all such minorities were so great that the Partition saw many people displaced and much inter-communal violence. Some have described the violence in Punjab as a retributive genocide. Total migration across Punjab during the partition is estimated at around 12 million people; around 6.5 million Muslims moved from East Punjab to West Punjab, and 4.7 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from West Punjab to East Punjab.\n\nAccording to the British plan for the partition of British India, all the 680 princely states were allowed to decide which of the two countries to join. With the exception of a few, most of the Muslim-majority princely-states acceded to Pakistan while most of the Hindu-majority princely states joined India. However, the decisions of some of the princely states would shape the Pakistan-India relationship considerably in the years to come.\n\nJunagadh issue\n\nJunagadh was a state on the south-western end of Gujarat, with the principalities of Manavadar, Mangrol and Babriawad. It was not contiguous to Pakistan and other states physically separated it from Pakistan. The state had an overwhelming Hindu population which constituted more than 80% of its citizens, while its ruler, Nawab Mahabat Khan, was a Muslim. Mahabat Khan acceded to Pakistan on 15 August 1947. Pakistan confirmed the acceptance of the accession on 15 September 1947.\n\nIndia did not accept the accession as legitimate. The Indian point of view was that Junagadh was not contiguous to Pakistan, that the Hindu majority of Junagadh wanted it to be a part of India, and that the state was surrounded by Indian territory on three sides.\n\nThe Pakistani point of view was that since Junagadh had a ruler and governing body who chose to accede to Pakistan, it should be allowed to do so. Also, because Junagadh had a coastline, it could have maintained maritime links with Pakistan even as an enclave within India.\n\nNeither of the states was able to resolve this issue amicably and it only added fuel to an already charged environment. Sardar Patel, India's Home Minister, felt that if Junagadh was permitted to go to Pakistan, it would create communal unrest across Gujarat. The government of India gave Pakistan time to void the accession and hold a plebiscite in Junagadh to pre-empt any violence in Gujarat. Samaldas Gandhi formed a government-in-exile, the Arzi Hukumat (in Urdu: Arzi: Transitional, Hukumat: Government) of the people of Junagadh. Patel ordered the annexation of Junagadh's three principalities.\n\nIndia cut off supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and occupied the principalities of Mangrol and Babariawad that had acceded to India. On 26 October, Nawab of Junagadh and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes with Indian troops. On 7 November, Junagadh's court, facing collapse, invited the Government of India to take over the State's administration. The Dewan of Junagadh, Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto, the father of the more famous Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, decided to invite the Government of India to intervene and wrote a letter to Mr. Buch, the Regional Commissioner of Saurashtra in the Government of India to this effect. The Government of Pakistan protested. The Government of India rejected the protests of Pakistan and accepted the invitation of the Dewan to intervene. Indian troops occupied Junagadh on 9 November 1947. In February 1948, a plebiscite held almost unanimously voted for accession to India.\n\nKashmir conflict\nKashmir was a Muslim-majority princely state, ruled by a Hindu king, Maharaja Hari Singh. At the time of the partition of India, Maharaja Hari Singh, the ruler of the state, preferred to remain independent and did not want to join either the Dominion of India or the Dominion of Pakistan.\n\nDespite the standstill agreement with Pakistan, teams of Pakistani forces were dispatched into Kashmir. Backed by Pakistani paramilitary forces, Pashtun Mehsud tribals invaded Kashmir in October 1947 under the code name \"Operation Gulmarg\" to seize Kashmir. The Maharaja requested military assistance from India. The Governor General of India, Lord Mountbatten, required the Maharaja to accede to India before India could send troops. Accordingly, the instrument of accession was signed and acceped during 26\u201327 October 1947. The accession as well as India's military assistance were supported by Sheikh Abdullah, the state's political leader heading the National Conference party, and Abdullah was appointed as the Head of Emergency Administration of the state the following week.\n\nPakistan refused to accept the state's accession to India and escalated the conflict, by giving full-fledged support to the rebels and invading tribes. A constant replenishment of Pashtun tribes were organised, and provided arms and ammunition as well as military leadership. \n\nIndian troops managed to evict the invading tribes from the Kashmir Valley but the onset of winter made much of the state impassable. In December 1947, India referred the conflict to the United Nations Security Council, requesting it to prevent the outbreak of a general war between the two fledgling nations. The Security Council passed Resolution 47, asking Pakistan to withdraw all its nationals from Kashmir, asking India to withdraw the bulk of its forces as a second step, and offering to conduct a plebiscite to determine the people's wishes. Though India rejected the resolution, it accepted a suitably amended version of it negotiated by the UN Commission set up for the purpose, as did Pakistan towards the end of 1948. A ceasefire was declared on the 1 January the following year.\n\nHowever, India and Pakistan could not agree on the suitable steps for demilitarisation to occur as prelude to the plebiscite. Pakistan organised the rebel fighting forces of Azad Kashmir into a full-fledged military of 32 battalions, and India insisted that it should be disbanded as part of the demilitarisation. No agreement was reached and the plebiscite never took place.\n\nWars, conflicts and disputes\n\nIndia and Pakistan have fought in numerous armed conflicts since their independence. There are three major wars that have taken place between the two states, namely in 1947, 1965 and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. In addition to this was the unofficial Kargil War in 1999 and some border skirmishes. Major conflicts between India and Pakistan, War of1947 and War of 1965, and a small-scale Kargil War in 1999, were triggered by conflict over the border of Kashmir. While both nations have held a shaky cease-fire agreement since 2003, they continue to trade fire across the disputed area. Both nations blame the other for breaking the cease-fire agreement, claiming that they are firing in retaliation for attacks. On both sides of the disputed border, an increase in territorial skirmishes that started in late 2016 and escalated into 2018 killed hundreds of civilians and made thousand homeless.\n\nWar of 1965\n\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 started following the culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 and Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against rule by India. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II. Hostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations-mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. The five-week war caused thousands of casualties on both sides. Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units, with substantial backing from air forces, and naval operations. It ended in a United Nations (UN) mandated ceasefire and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.\n\nWar of 1971\n\nPakistan, since independence, was geo-politically divided into two major regions, West Pakistan and East Pakistan. East Pakistan was occupied mostly by Bengali people. After a Pakistani military operation and a genocide on Bengalis in December 1971, following a political crisis in East Pakistan, the situation soon spiralled out of control in East Pakistan and India intervened in favour of the rebelling Bengali populace. The conflict, a brief but bloody war, resulted in the independence of East Pakistan. In the war, the Indian Army invaded East Pakistan from three sides, while the Indian Navy used the aircraft carrier  to impose a naval blockade of East Pakistan. The war saw the first offensive operations undertaken by the Indian Navy against an enemy port, when Karachi harbour was attacked twice during Operation Trident (1971) and Operation Python. These attacks destroyed a significant portion of Pakistan's naval strength, whereas no Indian ship was lost. The Indian Navy did, however, lose a single ship, when INS Khukri (F149) was torpedoed by a Pakistani submarine. 13 days after the invasion of East Pakistan, 93,000 Pakistani military personnel surrendered to the Indian Army and the Mukti Bahini. After the surrender of Pakistani forces, East Pakistan became the independent nation of Bangladesh.\n\nKargil War\n\nDuring the winter months of 1998\u201399, the Indian army vacated its posts at very high peaks in Kargil sector in Kashmir as it used to do every year. Pakistani Army intruded across the Line of Control and occupied the posts. Indian army discovered this in May 1999 when the snow thawed. This resulted in intense fighting between Indian and Pakistani forces, known as the Kargil conflict. Backed by the Indian Air Force, the Indian Army regained many of the posts that Pakistan had occupied. Pakistan later withdrew from the remaining portion under international pressure and high casualties.\n\nOther territorial claims\n\nThe relations are locked in other territorial claims such as the Siachen Glacier and Kori Creek.\n\nWater disputes\nThe Indus Waters Treaty governs the rivers that flow from India into Pakistan. Water is cited as one possible cause for a conflict between the two nations, but to date issues such as the Nimoo Bazgo Project have been resolved through diplomacy.\n\nBengal refugee crisis (1949)\n\nIn 1949, India recorded close to 1 million Hindu refugees, who flooded into West Bengal and other states from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh), owing to communal violence, intimidation and repression from authorities. The plight of the refugees outraged Hindus and Indian nationalists, and the refugee population drained the resources of Indian states, which were unable to absorb them. While not ruling out war, Prime Minister Nehru and Sardar Patel invited Liaquat Ali Khan for talks in Delhi. Although many Indians termed this appeasement, Nehru signed a pact with Liaquat Ali Khan that pledged both nations to the protection of minorities and creation of minority commissions. Khan and Nehru also signed a trade agreement, and committed to resolving bilateral conflicts through peaceful means. Steadily, hundreds of thousands of Hindus returned to East Pakistan, but the thaw in relations did not last long, primarily owing to the Kashmir conflict.\n\nInsurgency in Kashmir (1989\u2013present)\n\nAccording to some reports published by the Council of Foreign Relations, the Pakistan military and the ISI have provided covert support to terrorist groups active in Kashmir, including the al-Qaeda affiliate Jaish-e-Mohammed. Pakistan has denied any involvement in terrorist activities in Kashmir, arguing that it only provides political and moral support to the secessionist groups who wish to escape Indian rule. Many Kashmiri militant groups also maintain their headquarters in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, which is cited as further proof by the Indian government.\n\nJournalist Stephen Suleyman Schwartz notes that several militant and criminal groups are \"backed by senior officers in the Pakistani army, the country's ISI intelligence establishment and other armed bodies of the state.\"\n\nList of some insurgent attacks\n Insurgents attack on Jammu and Kashmir State Assembly: A car bomb exploded near the Jammu and Kashmir State Assembly on 1 October 2001, killing 27 people on an attack that was blamed on Kashmiri separatists. It was one of the most prominent attacks against India apart from on the Indian Parliament in December 2001. The dead bodies of the terrorists and the data recovered from them revealed that Pakistan was solely responsible for the activity.\n Qasim Nagar Attack: On 13 July 2003, armed men believed to be a part of the Lashkar-e-Toiba threw hand grenades at the Qasim Nagar market in Srinagar and then fired on civilians standing nearby killing twenty-seven and injuring many more.\n Assassination of Abdul Ghani Lone: Abdul Ghani Lone, a prominent All Party Hurriyat Conference leader, was assassinated by an unidentified gunmen during a memorial rally in Srinagar. The assassination resulted in wide-scale demonstrations against the Indian occupied-forces for failing to provide enough security cover for Mr. Lone.\n 20 July 2005 Srinagar Bombing: A car bomb exploded near an armoured Indian Army vehicle in the famous Church Lane area in Srinagar killing four Indian Army personnel, one civilian and the suicide bomber. Terrorist group Hizbul Mujahideen, claimed responsibility for the attack.\n Budshah Chowk attack: A terrorist attack on 29 July 2005 at Srinigar's city centre, Budshah Chowk, killed two and left more than 17 people injured. Most of those injured were media journalists.\n Murder of Ghulam Nabi Lone: On 18 October 2005, a suspected man killed Jammu and Kashmir's then education minister Ghulam Nabi Lone. No Terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attack.\n 2016 Uri attack: A terrorist attack by four heavily armed terrorists on 18 September 2016, near the town of Uri in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, killed 18 and left more than 20 people injured. It was reported as \"the deadliest attack on security forces in Kashmir in two decades\".\n 2019 Pulwama attack: On 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-bound suicide bomber in Lethpora near Awantipora, Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir, India. The attack resulted in the death of 38 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and the attacker. The responsibility of the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed.\n\nInsurgent activities elsewhere\nThe attack on the Indian Parliament was by far the most dramatic attack carried out allegedly by Pakistani terrorists. India blamed Pakistan for carrying out the attacks, an allegation which Pakistan strongly denied. The following 2001\u20132002 India\u2013Pakistan standoff raised concerns of a possible nuclear confrontation. However, international peace efforts ensured the cooling of tensions between the two nuclear-capable nations.\n\nApart from this, the most notable was the hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight IC 814 en route New Delhi from Kathmandu, Nepal. The plane was hijacked on 24 December 1999 approximately one hour after takeoff and was taken to Amritsar airport and then to Lahore in Pakistan. After refuelling the plane took off for Dubai and then finally landed in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Under intense media pressure, New Delhi complied with the hijackers' demand and freed Maulana Masood Azhar from its captivity in return for the freedom of the Indian passengers on the flight. The decision, however, cost New Delhi dearly. Maulana, who is believed to be hiding in Karachi, later became the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed, an organisation which has carried out several terrorist acts against Indian security forces in Kashmir.\n\nOn 22 December 2000, a group of terrorists belonging to the Lashkar-e-Toiba stormed the famous Red Fort in New Delhi. The Fort houses an Indian military unit and a high-security interrogation cell used both by the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Indian Army. The terrorists successfully breached the security cover around the Red Fort and opened fire at the Indian military personnel on duty killing two of them on spot. The attack was significant because it was carried out just two days after the declaration of the cease-fire between India and Pakistan.\n\nIn 2002, India claimed again that terrorists from Jammu and Kashmir were infiltrating into India, a claim denied by Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf, who claimed that such infiltration had stopped\u2014India's spokesperson for the External Affairs Ministry did away with Pakistan's claim, calling it \"terminological inexactitude.\" Only two months later, two Kashmiri terrorists belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed raided the Swami Narayan temple complex in Ahmedabad, Gujarat killing 30 people, including 18 women and five children. The attack was carried out on 25 September 2002, just few days after state elections were held in Jammu and Kashmir. Two identical letters found on both the terrorists claimed that the attack was done in retaliation for the deaths of thousands of Muslims during the Gujarat riots.\n\nTwo car bombs exploded in south Mumbai on 25 August 2003; one near the Gateway of India and the other at the famous Zaveri Bazaar, killing at least 48 and injuring 150 people. Though no terrorist group claimed responsibility for the attacks, Mumbai Police and RAW suspected Lashkar-e-Toiba's hand in the twin blasts.\n\nIn an unsuccessful attempt, six terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e-Toiba, stormed the Ayodhya Ram Janmbhomi complex on 5 July 2005. Before the terrorists could reach the main disputed site, they were shot down by Indian security forces. One Hindu worshipper and two policemen were injured during the incident.\n\n2001 Indian Parliament attack\n\nThe 2001 Indian Parliament attack was an attack at the Parliament of India in New Delhi on 13 December 2001, during which fourteen people, including the five men who attacked the building, were killed. The perpetrators were Lashkar-e-Taiba (Let) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists. The attack led to the deaths of five terrorists, six Delhi Police personnel, two Parliament Security Service personnel and a gardener, in total 14 and to increased tensions between India and Pakistan, resulting in the 2001\u201302 India\u2013Pakistan standoff.\n\n2001\u201302 India\u2013Pakistan standoff\n\nThe 2001\u20132002 India\u2013Pakistan standoff was a military standoff between India and Pakistan that resulted in the massing of troops on either side of the border and along the Line of Control (LoC) in the region of Kashmir. This was the first major military standoff between India and Pakistan since the Kargil War in 1999. The military buildup was initiated by India responding to a 2001 Indian Parliament attack and the 2001 Jammu and Kashmir legislative assembly attack. India claimed that the attacks were carried out by two Pakistan-based terror groups, the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, both of whom India has said are backed by Pakistan's ISI a charge that Pakistan denied. Tensions de-escalated following international diplomatic mediation which resulted in the October 2002 withdrawal of Indian and Pakistani troops from the international border.\n\n2007 Samjhauta Express bombings\n\nThe 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings was a terrorist attack targeted on the Samjhauta Express train on 18 February. The Samjhauta Express is an international train that runs from New Delhi, India to Lahore, Pakistan, and is one of two trains to cross the India-Pakistan border. At least 68 people were killed, mostly Pakistani civilians but also some Indian security personnel and civilians.\n\n2008 Mumbai attacks\n\nThe 2008 Mumbai attacks by ten Pakistani terrorists killed over 173 and wounded 308. The sole surviving gunman Ajmal Kasab who was arrested during the attacks was found to be a Pakistani national. This fact was acknowledged by Pakistani authorities. In May 2010, an Indian court convicted him on four counts of murder, waging war against India, conspiracy and terrorism offences, and sentenced him to death.\n\nIndia blamed the Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistan-based militant group, for planning and executing the attacks. Indian officials demanded Pakistan extradite suspects for trial. They also said that, given the sophistication of the attacks, the perpetrators \"must have had the support of some official agencies in Pakistan\". In July 2009 Pakistani authorities confirmed that LeT plotted and financed the attacks from LeT camps in Karachi and Thatta. In November 2009, Pakistani authorities charged seven men they had arrested earlier, of planning and executing the assault.\n\nOn 9 April 2015, the foremost ringleader of the attacks, Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi was granted bail against surety bonds of  in Pakistan.\n\nThe Indian intelligence agency RAW is claimed to be working in cover to malign Pakistan and train & support insurgents for Balochistan conflict.\n\nWeapons of mass destruction\n\nIndia has a long history of development of nuclear weapons. Origins of India's nuclear program dates back to 1944, when started its nuclear program soon after its independence. In the 1940s\u20131960s, India's nuclear program slowly matured towards militarisation and expanded the nuclear power infrastructure throughout the country. Decisions on the development of nuclear weapons were made by Indian political leaders after the Chinese invasion and territorial annexation of northern India. In 1967, India's nuclear program was aimed at the development of nuclear weapons, with Indira Gandhi carefully overseeing the development of weapons. In 1971, India gained military and political momentum over Pakistan, after a successful military campaign against Pakistan. Starting preparations for a nuclear test in 1972, India finally exploded its first nuclear bomb in Pokhran test range, codename Smiling Buddha, in 1974. During the 1980s\u201390s, India began development of space and nuclear rockets, which marked Pakistan's efforts to engage in the space race with India. Pakistan's own program developed space and nuclear missiles and began unmanned flight tests of its space vehicles in the mid-1990s, which continues in the present.\n\nAfter the defeat in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1971, Pakistan launched its own nuclear bomb program in 1972, and accelerated its efforts in 1974, after India exploded its first nuclear bomb in Pokhran test range, codename Smiling Buddha. This large-scale nuclear bomb program was directly in response to India's nuclear program. In 1983, Pakistan achieved a major milestone in its efforts after it covertly performed a series of non-fission tests, codename Kirana-I. No official announcements of such cold tests were made by Pakistan government. Over the next several years, Pakistan expanded and modernised nuclear power projects around the country to supply its electricity sector and to provide back-up support and benefit to its national economy. In 1988, a mutual understanding was reached between the two countries in which each pledged not to attack nuclear facilities. Agreements on cultural exchanges and civil aviation were also initiated, also in 1988. Finally, in 1998, India exploded its second nuclear test (see: Pokhran-II) which invited Pakistan to follow the latter's step and performed its own atomic tests (see Chagai-I and Chagai-II).\n\nTalks and other confidence-building measures\nAfter the 1971 war, Pakistan and India made slow progress towards the normalisation of relations. In July 1972, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and Pakistani President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto met in the Indian hill station of Shimla. They signed the Shimla Agreement, by which India would return all Pakistani personnel (over 90,000) and captured territory in the west, and the two countries would \"settle their differences by peaceful means through bilateral negotiations.\" Diplomatic and trade relations were also re-established in 1976.\n\n1990s\nIn 1997, high-level Indo-Pakistan talks resumed after a three-year pause. The Prime Ministers of Pakistan and India met twice and the foreign secretaries conducted three rounds of talks. In June 1997, the foreign secretaries identified eight \"outstanding issues\" around which continuing talks would be focused. The conflict over the status of Kashmir, (referred by India as Jammu and Kashmir), an issue since Independence, remains the major stumbling block in their dialogue. India maintains that the entire former princely state is an integral part of the Indian union, while Pakistan insists that UN resolutions calling for self-determination of the people of the state/province must be taken into account. It however refuses to abide by the previous part of the resolution, which calls for it to vacate all territories occupied.\n\nIn September 1997, the talks broke down over the structure of how to deal with the issues of Kashmir, and peace and security. Pakistan advocated that the issues be treated by separate working groups. India responded that the two issues be taken up along with six others on a simultaneous basis.\n\nAttempts to restart dialogue between the two nations were given a major boost by the February 1999 meeting of both Prime Ministers in Lahore and their signing of three agreements.\n\nA subsequent military coup in Pakistan that overturned the democratically elected Nawaz Sharif government in October of the same year also proved a setback to relations.\n\n2000s\nIn 2001, a summit was called in Agra; Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf turned up to meet Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee. The talks fell through.\n\nOn 20 June 2004, with a new government in place in India, both countries agreed to extend a nuclear testing ban and to set up a hotline between their foreign secretaries aimed at preventing misunderstandings that might lead to a nuclear war.\n\nBaglihar Dam issue was a new issue raised by Pakistan in 2005.\n\nAfter Dr. Manmohan Singh become prime minister of India in May 2004, the Punjab provincial Government declared it would develop Gah, his place of birth, as a model village in his honour and name a school after him. There is also a village in India named Pakistan, despite occasional pressure over the years to change its name the villagers have resisted. Violent activities in the region declined in 2004. There are two main reasons for this: warming of relations between New Delhi and Islamabad which consequently lead to a ceasefire between the two countries in 2003 and the fencing of the Line of Control being carried out by the Indian Army. Moreover, coming under intense international pressure, Islamabad was compelled to take action against the militants' training camps on its territory. In 2004, the two countries also agreed upon decreasing the number of troops present in the region.\n\nUnder pressure, Kashmiri militant organisations made an offer for talks and negotiations with New Delhi, which India welcomed.\n\nIndia's Border Security Force blamed the Pakistani military for providing cover-fire for the terrorists whenever they infiltrated into Indian territory from Pakistan. Pakistan in turn has also blamed India for providing support to terrorist organisations operating in Pakistan such as the BLA.\n\nIn 2005, Pakistan's information minister, Sheikh Rashid, was alleged to have run a terrorist training camp in 1990 in N.W. Frontier, Pakistan. The Pakistani government dismissed the charges against its minister as an attempt to hamper the ongoing peace process between the two neighbours.\n\nBoth India and Pakistan have launched several mutual confidence-building measures (CBMs) to ease tensions between the two. These include more high-level talks, easing visa restrictions, and restarting of cricket matches between the two. The new bus service between Srinagar and Muzaffarabad has also helped bring the two sides closer. Pakistan and India have also decided to co-operate on economic fronts.\n\nSome improvements in the relations are seen with the re-opening of a series of transportation networks near the India\u2013Pakistan border, with the most important being bus routes and railway lines.\n\nA major clash between Indian security forces and militants occurred when a group of insurgents tried to infiltrate into Kashmir from Pakistan in July 2005. The same month also saw a Kashmiri militant attack on Ayodhya and Srinagar. However, these developments had little impact on the peace process.\n\nAn Indian man held in Pakistani prisons since 1975 as an accused spy walked across the border to freedom 3 March 2008, an unconditional release that Pakistan said was done to improve relations between the two countries.\n\nIn 2006, a \"Friends Without Borders\" scheme began with the help of two British tourists. The idea was that Indian and Pakistani children would make pen pals and write friendly letters to each other. The idea was so successful in both countries that the organisation found it \"impossible to keep up\". The World's Largest Love Letter was recently sent from India to Pakistan.\n\n2010s\n\nIn December 2010, several Pakistani newspapers published stories about India's leadership and relationship with militants in Pakistan that the papers claimed were found in the United States diplomatic cables leak.  A British newspaper, The Guardian, which had the Wikileaks cables in its possession reviewed the cables and concluded that the Pakistani claims were \"not accurate\" and that \"WikiLeaks [was] being exploited for propaganda purposes.\"\n\nOn 10 February 2011, India agreed to resume talks with Pakistan which were suspended after 26/11 Mumbai Attacks. India had put on hold all the diplomatic relations saying it will only continue if Pakistan will act against the accused of Mumbai attacks.\n\nOn 13 April 2012, following a thaw in relations whereby India gained MFN status in the country, India announced the removal of restrictions on FDI investment from Pakistan to India.\n\nThe Foreign Minister of Pakistan on 11 July 2012, stated in Phnom Penh that her country is willing to resolve some of the disputes like, Sir Creek and Siachen on the basis of agreements reached in past.\n\nOn 7 September 2012, Indian External Affairs Minister would pay 3-day visit to Pakistan to review the progress of bilateral dialogue with his Pakistani counterpart.\n\nIn August 2019, following the approval of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill in the Indian Parliament, which revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, further tension was brought between the two countries, with Pakistan downgrading their diplomatic ties, closing its airspace, and suspending bilateral trade with India.\n\nThe Kartarpur Corridor was opened in November 2019.\n\n2020s\nOn 25 February 2021, India and Pakistan issued a joint statement indicating that both sides agreed to stop firing at each other at the disputed Line of Control border in Kashmir.\n\nResponse to natural calamities\n\n2001 Gujarat earthquake in India\nIn response to the 2001 Gujarat earthquake, Pakistani President Pervez Mushrraf sent a plane load of relief supplies from Islamabad to Ahmedabad. They carried 200 tents and more than 2,000 blankets. Furthermore, the President called Indian PM to express his 'sympathy' over the loss from the earthquake.\n\n2005 earthquake in Pakistan\nIndia offered aid to Pakistan in response to the 2005 Kashmir earthquake on 8 October. Indian and Pakistani High Commissioners consulted with one another regarding cooperation in relief work. India sent 25 tonnes of relief material to Pakistan including food, blankets and medicine. Large Indian companies such as Infosys offered aid up to $226,000. On 12 October, an Ilyushin-76 cargo plane ferried across seven truckloads (about 82 tons) of army medicines, 15,000 blankets and 50 tents and returned to New Delhi. A senior air force official also stated that they had been asked by the Indian government to be ready to fly out another similar consignment. \n\nOn 14 October, India dispatched the second consignment of relief material to Pakistan, by train through the Wagah Border. The consignment included 5,000 blankets, 370 tents, 5 tons of plastic sheets and 12 tons of medicine. A third consignment of medicine and relief material was also sent shortly afterwards by train. India also pledged $25 million as aid to Pakistan. India opened the first of three points at Chakan Da Bagh, in Poonch, on the Line of Control between India and Pakistan for earthquake relief work.\n\n2022 Pakistan floods \nAmid the 2022 Pakistan floods, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his \"heartfelt condolences to families of the victims\". As of 30 August, it has been reported that the government of India is considering sending relief aid to Pakistan.\n\nFugitives\nIndia has accused some of the most wanted Indian fugitives, such as Dawood Ibrahim, of having a presence in Pakistan. On 11 May 2011, India released a list of 50 \"Most Wanted Fugitives\" hiding in Pakistan. This was to tactically pressure Pakistan after the killing of Osama bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad. After two errors in the list received publicity, the Central Bureau of Investigation removed it from their website, pending review. After this incident, the Pakistani interior ministry rejected the list forwarded by India to Islamabad, saying it should first probe if those named in the list were even living in the country.\n\nSocial relations\n\nCultural links\nIndia and Pakistan, particularly Northern India and Eastern Pakistan, to some degree have similar cultures, cuisines and languages due to common Indo-Aryan heritage which span through the two countries and throughout much of the northern subcontinent which also underpin the historical ties between the two. Pakistani singers, musicians, comedians and entertainers have enjoyed widespread popularity in India, with many achieving overnight fame in the Indian film industry Bollywood. Likewise, Indian music and film are very popular in Pakistan. Being located in the northernmost region of South Asia, Pakistan's culture is somewhat similar to that of North India, especially the northwest.\n\nThe Punjab region was split into Punjab, Pakistan and Punjab, India following the independence and partition of the two countries in 1947. The Punjabi people are today the largest ethnic group in Pakistan and also an important ethnic group of northern India. The founder of Sikhism was born in the modern-day Pakistani Punjab province, in the city of Nankana Sahib. Each year, millions of Indian Sikh pilgrims cross over to visit holy Sikh sites in Nankana Sahib. The Sindhi people are the native ethnic group of the Pakistani province of Sindh. Many Hindu Sindhis migrated to India in 1947, making the country home to a sizeable Sindhi community. In addition, the millions of Muslims who migrated from India to the newly created Pakistan during independence came to be known as the Muhajir people; they are settled predominantly in Karachi and still maintain family links in India.\n\nRelations between Pakistan and India have also resumed through platforms such as media and communications. Aman ki Asha is a joint venture and campaign between The Times of India and the Jang Group calling for mutual peace and development of diplomatic and cultural relations.\n\nGeographic links\n\nThe India\u2013Pakistan border is the official international boundary that demarcates the Indian states of Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat from the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Sindh. The Wagah border is the only road crossing between India and Pakistan and lies on the famous Grand Trunk Road, connecting Lahore, Pakistan with Amritsar, India. Each evening, the Wagah-Attari border ceremony takes place, in which the flags are lowered and guards on both sides make a pompous military display and exchange handshakes.\n\nLinguistic ties\nHindustani is the lingua franca of North India and Pakistan, as well as the official language of both countries, under the standard registers Hindi and Urdu, respectively. Standard Urdu is mutually intelligible with standard Hindi. Hindustani is also widely understood and used as a lingua franca amongst South Asians including Sri Lankans, Nepalis and Bangladeshis, and is the language of Bollywood, which is enjoyed throughout much of the subcontinent.\n\nApart from Hindustani, India and Pakistan also share a distribution of the Punjabi language (written in the Gurmukhi script in Indian Punjab, and the Shahmukhi script in Pakistani Punjab), Kashmiri language and Sindhi language, mainly due to population exchange. These languages belong to a common Indo-Aryan family that are spoken in countries across the subcontinent.\n\nMatrimonial ties\nSome Indian and Pakistani people marry across the border at instances. Many Indians and Pakistanis in the diaspora, especially in the United States, intermarry, as there are large cultural similarities between the two countries respectively.\n\nIn April 2010 a high-profile Pakistani cricketer, Shoaib Malik married the Indian tennis star Sania Mirza. The wedding received much media attention and was said to transfix both India and Pakistan.\n\nSporting ties\n\nCricket and hockey matches between the two (as well as other sports to a lesser degree such as those of the SAARC games) have often been political in nature. During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan General Zia-ul Haq travelled to India for a bout of \"cricket diplomacy\" to keep India from supporting the Soviets by opening another front. Pervez Musharaff also tried to do the same more than a decade later but to no avail. \n\nFrom 2012, India stopped playing bilateral cricket series against Pakistan. Now it only plays against them in Asian Cricket Council, ICC events such as ODI, T20 world cups etc. In 2017 then Sport minister of India, Vijay Goel said, that Pakistan have to stop sponsoring terrorists, terrorism and sports can not happen together. Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) also opposed playing with them, citing the reason that, we can not play without the permission of our government. BCCI also do not allow their players to play in IPL.\n\nIn tennis, Rohan Bopanna of India and Aisam-ul-Haq Qureshi of Pakistan have formed a successful duo and have been dubbed as the \"Indo-Pak Express.\"\n\nDiasporic relations\nThe large size of the Indian diaspora and Pakistani diaspora in many different countries throughout the world has created strong diasporic relations.\nBritish Indians and British Pakistanis, the largest and second-largest ethnic minorities living in the United Kingdom respectively, are said to have friendly relations with one another. It is quite common for a \"Little India\" and a \"Little Pakistan\" to co-exist in South Asian ethnic enclaves in overseas countries. There are various cities such as Birmingham, Blackburn and Manchester where British Indians and British Pakistanis live alongside each other in peace and harmony. Both Indians and Pakistanis living in the UK fit under the category of British Asian. The UK is also home to the Pakistan & India friendship forum. In the United States, Indians and Pakistanis are classified under the South Asian American category and share many cultural traits. In the US, intermarriage between Indians and Pakistanis is common.\n\nThe British MEP Sajjad Karim is of Pakistani origin. He is a member of the European Parliament Friends of India Group, Karim was also responsible for opening up Europe to free trade with India. He narrowly escaped the Mumbai attacks at Hotel Taj in November 2008. Despite the atrocity, Karim does not wish the remaining killer Ajmal Kasab to be sentenced to death. He said: \"I believe he had a fair and transparent trial and I support the guilty verdict. But I am not a supporter of capital punishment. I believe he should be given a life sentence, but that life should mean life.\"\n\nTrade links\n\nThe size of India-Pakistan trade is very small relative to the size of their economies and the fact that they share a contiguous border. Trade across direct routes has been curtailed formally, so the bulk of India-Pakistan trade is routed through Dubai.\n\nSee also\n\nForeign relations\n Foreign relations of India\n Foreign relations of Pakistan\n South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)\n\nHistory\n History of India\n History of the Republic of India\n History of Pakistan\n History of the Kashmir conflict\n\nHuman rights\n Human rights in India\n Human rights in Pakistan\n Persecution of Hindus\n Persecution of Muslims\n\nCultural issues\n Hindi-Urdu controversy\n Anti-Pakistan sentiment\n Indophobia\n\nWars and skirmishes\n Indo-Pakistani Wars\n India\u2013Pakistan border skirmishes\n\nSports\n India-Pakistan cricket rivalry\n India-Pakistan field hockey rivalry\n India\u2013Pakistan football rivalry\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography \n .\n .\n .\n \n .\n .\n \n .\n .\n \n .\n .\n .\n .\n .\n\nFurther reading\n Budania, Rajpal, \"India's Pakistan Policy: A Study in the Context of Security,\" South Asian Studies, Vol.30:2,1995.\n Burke, S.M.,Mainsprings of Indian and Pakistani Foreign Policies, Minneapolis, University of Minnesota, 1974.\n Brines Russel, The Indo-Pakistan Conflict, London, Pall Mall Press, 1968.\n Malone, David M., C.

The park offers a  hike to the summit of Mount Saint Helena from which much of the Bay Area can be seen. On clear days it is possible to see the peak of Mount Shasta,  distant.\n\nOverview\nThe park is named after Robert Louis Stevenson, the Scottish author of Treasure Island and Kidnapped.  In 1880, Stevenson and his new wife Fanny Vandegrift Osbourne spent their honeymoon living in a cabin at a played-out mine on the mountain along with Fanny's son Lloyd Osbourne. Although nothing remains of the cabin, the site is identified on the trail to the summit.  Stevenson's book Silverado Squatters contains stories he wrote about his experiences during his visit to the area.\n\nThe area has rough terrain, with evergreen forests in the canyons on north-facing slopes and chaparral on the south-facing slopes.\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson State Park is located off State Route 29 between Calistoga and Middletown.  The park is registered as California Historical Landmark #710.\n\n2017 fire and temporary closure\nAs a result of a fire starting on Tubbs Lane in Calistoga, the park was temporarily closed on October 10, 2017.\n\nGallery\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson State Park website\n\nCalifornia Historical Landmarks\nState parks of California\nParks in Napa County, California\nParks in Sonoma County, California\nRobert Louis Stevenson\nBay Area Ridge Trail", "The Lincoln Hotel is a historic hotel building in Scottsbluff, Nebraska. It was built by Childes & Price in 1917-1918 for the Nebraska Hotel Company, whose directors were F.E. Schaaf and R.W. Johnston. The Scottsbluff Commercial Club donated the land and purchased $5,000 of stocks in the company, which went bankrupt a few years later. The building was designed in the Classical Revival style by architect A. Bandy. From 1965 to 1971 the building was used as dormitories and classrooms by the Hiram Scott College, and later used as dormitories again by the Platte Valley Bible College from 1976 to 1983.

It sank while bringing reinforcements to Peru during the war of independence, and some of its crew or passengers may have discovered and landed on Antarctica.\n\nHistory \n\nIn 1819, the San Telmo, commanded by Captain Joaqu\u00edn de Toledo y Parra, was the flagship of a Spanish naval squadron under Brigadier Rosendo Porlier y Asteguieta bound for Callao, Peru, to reinforce colonial forces there fighting the independence movements in Spanish America. It was damaged by severe weather in the Drake Passage, south of Cape Horn on 2 September 1819.\n\nLegacy \n\nA portion of the 644 officers, soldiers and seamen of the San Telmo may have been the first people to land on Antarctica. Some remnants and signs of the wreckage were later found by William Smith on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands. If any crew members survived the initial sinking and managed to land there, they would have been the first humans in history to reach the continent.\n\nSan Telmo Island, off the north coast of Livingston Island, is named after the ship.\n\nMoments prior to the battle that led to the capture of Valdivia in February 1820 the patriot force told the Spanish garrison of the Valdivian Fort System they were part of the convoy of San Telmo.

A native of the northwestern region of Azarbaijan, he spent all of his life there as well as in the neighbouring region of Transcaucasia, mainly serving as a court poet under the local dynasties of the Rawadids and Shaddadids.\n\nBackground \nQatran was born between 1009 and 1014 in Shadiabad, near the city of Tabriz in the northwestern region of Azarbaijan. Shadiabad is mentioned as his hometown in one of his verses, which dismisses other accounts, which calls him by the nisbas of Tirmidhi, Jabali, Jili, Urmawi, Ajali. According to the 15th-century Timurid-era biographer Dawlatshah Samarqandi, the name of Qatran's father was Mansur, but this is not supported by earlier sources. Qatran is given the epithet of \"Adudi\" in several sources, which has been suggested to be a corruption of Azdi, the name of an Arab tribe which the ruling Rawadid dynasty was descended from.\n\nBiography \n\nNot much is known about the life of Qatran. As a Western Persian who spoke the Iranian dialect of Azari, Qatran had some difficulties in understanding \"Parsi\" (i.e. Dari), the Eastern Persian dialect of Khurasan. This is mentioned in the Safarnama of the Khurasanian poet Nasir Khusraw when he met him in Tabriz in 1046; \"He wrote good poetry, but did not know Persian well. He came to me bringing the diwan of Munjik and Daqiqi, which he read with me, questioning me about every passage in which he found difficulty. I told him its meaning and he wrote it down.\" Dari contained Eastern Iranian words (such as Sogdian), which were unintelligible to a Western Persian like Qatran. It was seemingly due to this that Qatran composed a lexicon written in Persian, named Tafasir fi lughat al-Furs, which has not survived. His work is mentioned in the preface of the Persian lexicon of his contemporary Asadi Tusi, which was composed for the educated population of Azarbaijan. Asadi never cites any of Qatran's verses in his lexicon, which further underscores that the intention of the work was to clarify the uncommon words used in Eastern Persian. With the reunification of Iran by Seljuk Empire in the mid 11th-century, eastern Persian literature had a better opportunity to sway the western provinces.\n\nQatran seemingly spent all of his life in Azarbaijan and Transcaucasia, where he served under local rulers. His diwan was compiled and published by the 20th-century Iranian businessman and collector Hajj Mohammad Nakhjavani (died 1962). It contains 3000\u201310,000 couplets, which mentions about thirty patrons. The majority of the odes in his diwan are dedicated to the Rawadid rulers of Tabriz, Abu Mansur Wahsudan () and his successor Abu Nasr Mamlan II (), as well as the Shaddadid rulers of Ganja, Abu'l-Aswar Shavur ibn Fadl () and Fadl ibn Shavur (). Other notable patrons include Abu Dulaf-i Dayrani, the ruler of Nakhchivan. Some works have been erroneously attributed to Qatran, such as the Qausnama (\"The Book of Arch\"), which was in reality the work of a certain Qatran Tirmidhi, who lived 100 years after him. Some works of the prominent Persian poet Rudaki (died 941) have also erroneously been attributed to Qatran, due to the similarity of their styles, and the names of their patrons, the Samanid ruler Nasr ibn Ahmad () and Abu Nasr Mamlan. Qatran was the first poet from Azarbaijan to compose poetry in Dari.\n\nQatran's work is also an important source in historiography, as many names and events in Azarbaijan and the Caucasus mentioned in his poems would have been otherwise unknown. This includes among other things the Ghuzz incursions into Arran and Azarbaijan, and the peace treaty between the Rawadids and Shaddadids in 1040. During his later career, Qatran suffered from gout, possibly an indication of his good welfare. Qatran died in Ganja; the date of his death is uncertain. According to some accounts of writers such as the 19th-century Persian poet Reza-Qoli Khan Hedayat, Qatran died in 1072. However, one of Qatran's qasidas dedicated to Abu Nasr Mamlan indicate that he at least lived till 1088. According to Taqi, Qatran died in 1092.\n\nLegacy \nQatran is considered to have been one of the leading poets in 11th-century Iran. The modern historian De Bruijn calls him the first eminent poet born in the western Iranian provinces.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\nFurther reading \n \n\n11th-century births\n11th-century deaths\n11th-century Persian-language poets\n11th-century writers\n11th-century Iranian people\nPoets from Tabriz\nBurials in Maqbaratoshoara", "Frank Michael Kratovil Jr. (born May 29, 1968) is an American politician who was the U.S. representative for  from 2009 to 2011. Elected in 2008, he was defeated in his bid for reelection on November 2, 2010. Kratovil is a member of the Democratic Party. He previously served as State's Attorney of Queen Anne's County on Maryland's Eastern Shore, and he was appointed as a judge for the county's District Court by Governor Martin O'Malley in December 2011.\n\nEarly life, education and career\nFrank Kratovil was born in Lanham, Maryland, and spent his childhood in Prince George's County, Maryland.  He is the son of Frank M. Kratovil Sr. and Lynnda Kratovil.  Kratovil attended high school at Queen Anne School in Upper Marlboro and graduated in 1986.  Kratovil received his bachelor's degree in 1990 from Western Maryland College. He joined Phi Delta Theta while there and played soccer, basketball and baseball. In soccer, he served as Captain for three years, was named to the Middle-Atlantic Conference All-Conference Team and received the Most Valuable Offensive Player Award and the Homer Earl Outstanding Player Award.  Upon graduation, he was awarded the Bates Prize for the Most Outstanding Graduating Male, the Charles W. Havens Award, awarded to an intercollegiate athlete who \"has shown by word and deeds the attributes of charity, altruism, benevolence, and a humane and compassionate concern for his fellow man\", and the Carroll County Scholar-Athlete Award. Kratovil then graduated with honors from University of Baltimore School of Law in 1994. He served from 1994 to 1995 as Law Clerk for Judge Darlene G. Perry of Prince George's County Circuit Court.  From 1995 to 1997 he served as Assistant State's Attorney for Prince George's County, Maryland.\n\nIn 1997, Kratovil moved to the Eastern Shore and was appointed Assistant State's Attorney for Queen Anne's County, Maryland.  During his tenure as Assistant State's Attorney he served as the county's only full-time Prosecutor and Community Prosecutor.  He continued to serve as Assistant State's Attorney until 2001 when he was appointed as Deputy State's Attorney in Kent County, Maryland.  He also served as the President of the Young Democrats of Maryland from 1997 to 1998, and in 1998 was selected to represent the United States on the American Council of Young Political Leaders' delegation to Taiwan. He was also a member and on the executive committee of the Queen Anne's County local management board.\n\nQueen Anne's County State's Attorney\nIn 2002, Kratovil ran for the office of State's Attorney in Queen Anne's County and was elected after defeating four-term incumbent David Gregory in the primary and Republican Paul W. Comfort in the general election. Kratovil assumed office at the age of 34 making him the youngest State's Attorney in Maryland. He ran unopposed for re-election in 2006. He was elected by his fellow State's Attorneys to be President of the Maryland State's Attorneys' Association (MDSAA) for 2005. During his time as President of the MDSAA, he pushed for stronger legislation to expand prosecution of gangs and increased awareness of growing problems with drugs and gangs in Maryland's rural areas.\n\nU.S. House of Representatives\n\nElections\n\n2008\n\nOn June 4, 2007, Kratovil announced that he would run for Congress in Maryland's 1st congressional district.  During the February 12 primary, Kratovil defeated fellow Democrats Christopher Robinson, Steve Harper, and Joseph Werner.\n\nKratovil expected to face nine-term Republican incumbent Wayne Gilchrest, a leading Republican moderate, in the general election. However, Gilchrest was ousted in the Republican primary by a considerably more conservative Republican, State Senator Andy Harris. This significantly changed the race, as Kratovil was now running for an open seat rather than against a long-term incumbent.\n\nKratovil was initially a heavy underdog due to the district's election history. Although Democrats and Republicans are nearly tied in registration, the district has a strong tinge of social conservatism that favors Republicans. It had been in Republican hands for all but 14 years since 1947, although Kratovil received a significant boost when Gilchrest endorsed him over Harris. In June, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) decided to back Kratovil's campaign financially through their Red to Blue program.  Kratovil, who is considered a moderate, picked up a number of endorsements from local Eastern Shore Republicans as well as Democrats. He also received an endorsement from the Blue Dog Coalition, a group of fiscally conservative congressional Democrats. CQ Politics designated the race as \"No Clear Favorite.\"\n\nThe November election was close, as expected. On election night, Kratovil led Harris by 915 votes. After two rounds of counting absentee ballots, Kratovil's lead grew to 2,000 votes. Forecasting that it would be nearly impossible for Harris to close the gap, most media outlets declared Kratovil the winner on the night of November 7. Harris finally conceded on November 11.\n\nKratovil's election dramatized the geographic split that characterizes the 1st District. An Eastern Shore resident, Kratovil carried all nine counties on the Shore. However, he lost badly in the district's portion of Baltimore County, including most of Harris' base in Baltimore's more conservative eastern suburbs. He also lost the district's portions of Harford and Anne Arundel counties on the Western Shore.  The district's voters are split almost evenly between the two regions. Kratovil therefore became only the third Democrat to represent the 1st since 1947. Proving just how Republican this district still was, John McCain carried it with nearly 60 percent of the vote, which was his best showing in the state.\n\n2010\n\nHarris announced in May 2009 that he would seek a rematch against Kratovil, citing Kratovil's vote for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in its final form.\n\nKratovil based his 2010 re-election bid on his independent streak in Washington. He was quoted as saying \"We can send someone to Washington who is going to continue to be independent and put the interests of the people of his district first, or we can send people that are going to put their own extreme ideological views ahead of the best interests of the people of this district.\" He also pointed to his overall record in Congress as proof. He was ranked as being in the top ten of independent voting records in Congress by CQ Politics in 2009.\n\nA \"Super PAC\" group called The Concerned Taxpayers of America paid $150,000 for ads attacking Kratovil, and $300,000 for ads attacking Peter DeFazio of Oregon. Mid-October 2010 quarterly FEC filings showed that the group was solely funded by $300,000 from Daniel G. Schuster Inc., a concrete firm in Owings Mills, Maryland, and $200,000 from New York hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, the co-head of Renaissance Technologies of Setauket, New York. According to Dan Eggen at The Washington Post, the group said \"it was formed in September 'to engage citizens from every walk of life and political affiliation' in the fight against 'runaway spending.'\" Its only expenditures were for these ads. Schuster was the top contributor to Harris.\n\nThe district reverted to form, and Kratovil was defeated, taking 42 percent of the vote to Harris' 54 percent. No Democrat has won more than 40 percent of the vote in the district since Kratovil left office.\n\nTenure\nDespite the conservative nature of the district, analysis conducted by The Washington Post and others found Kratovil voted with the House Democratic Leadership 85% of the time. Major Democratic priorities Kratovil voted for included:\n\nAn analysis of major legislation only by Congressional Quarterly and Centerline.org concluded Kratovil was one of the most centrist congressmen in the country.  Kratovil voted against the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in March 2010, citing his district's overwhelming opposition to it  and \"the overall cost, the deficit impact, and the negative impact that the bill's employer mandates could have on job creation.\"\n\nCommittee assignments\n Committee on Agriculture\nSubcommittee on Conservation, Credit, Energy, and Research\nSubcommittee on Horticulture and Organic Agriculture\nSubcommittee on Livestock, Dairy, and Poultry\n Committee on Armed Services\nSubcommittee on Readiness\nSubcommittee on Air and Land Forces\n Committee on Natural Resources\nSubcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans and Wildlife\n\nElectoral history\n\nJudicial career\nIn late December 2011, Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley appointed Kratovil as a judge for the Queen Anne's County District Court.

He played hurling with his local club Buffer's Alley and with the Wexford senior inter-county team from 1984 until 2000.\n\nPlaying career\n\nClub\n\nDempsey played his club hurling with the famous Buffer's Alley GAA club and enjoyed much success. He first came to prominence on the club's senior team in the early 1980s as the team was in the middle of completing a four in-a-row of county championship titles between 1982 and 1985. This last county title was later converted into a Leinster club title for Dempsey, but his side was beaten by Kilruane MacDonagh's of Tipperary in the All-Ireland final. 1988 saw Dempsey won another county title before later adding a second Leinster club medal to his collection. Once again Buffer's Alley reached the All-Ireland final, this time with O\u2019Donovan Rossa of Antrim providing the opposition. Victory went to the Wexford men by 2-12 to 0-12, giving Dempsey an All-Ireland club medal. He won another set of county medals in 1989 and 1991 before collecting a third Leinster club medal in the latter year. His side was later defeated by Sarsfield's of Galway in the All-Ireland final. Dempsey finished off his career by winning a final county title in 1993.\n\nInter-county\n\nDempsey first came to prominence as a dual player at minor level. He played both hurling and Gaelic football for Wexford in the under-18 grade, but he enjoyed little success. Dempsey later joined the county under-21 hurling team. Here he won a Leinster title in 1986 following victory in a replay over Offaly. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Galway provide the opposition. Dempsey's side were completely outclassed on that occasion as Galway won by 1-14 to 2-5.\n\nBy this stage Dempsey had already made his debut with the Wexford senior team, but it was not a happy time to be a Wexford hurler. The county had been pushed back into third place in the Leinster Championship behind Kilkenny and Offaly. Provincial final appearances in 1988 and 1992 brought nothing but defeat for Dempsey's team. In 1993 Dempsey was captain as Wexford looked set for glory when they reached the final of the National Hurling League. The opponents on that occasion were Cork; the game ended in a draw. The replay saw extra time being played, but both sides ended level once again. At the third attempt Cork emerged victorious by 3-11 to 1-12. In spite of this defeat expectations were still high for the Leinster championship. In the final of that competition Wexford drew with arch rivals and All-Ireland champions Kilkenny and there was hope of success. The replay was a different affair as Kilkenny won handily enough by 2-12 to 0-11.\n\nWexford were defeated in the Leinster final again in 1994 before disappearing from the championship at the first hurdle in 1995. By 1996 things were beginning to change in Wexford, thanks in no small way to the new manager Liam Griffin. Once again Dempsey lined out in the Leinster final. Offaly provided the opposition on that occasion; history was made as Wexford won by 2-23 to 2-15. It was Demspey's first senior Leinster title and Wexford's first since 1977. Wexford later defeated Galway in the penultimate game of the championship, setting up an All-Ireland final meeting with Limerick. The Munster men were slight favourites going into the game. They were the beaten finalists of 1994 and had already beaten Clare, the reigning champions, in the Munster Championship. The game was far from a classic, though it did provide excitement. Dempsey was the hero of the day as he scored a goal after nineteen minutes to give Wexford a major advantage. His side led by 1-8 to 0-10 at half-time in spite of having \u00c9amonn Scallon sent off. Wexford took a four-point lead in the second-half; this was whittled back to two points as Wexford hung on for the last twenty minutes. The final score of 1-13 to 0-14 showed how vital Dempsey's goal was. It was his first All-Ireland medal and Wexford's first since 1968. Dempsey was later honoured with an All-Star award.\n\nDempsey captured a second Leinster medal in 1997 as Kilkenny fell in the provincial decider. 1997 saw the introduction of the so-called \u2018back-door\u2019 system whereby the defeated Munster and Leinster finalists were allowed back into the All-Ireland championship at the quarter-final stage. Because of this Wexford's opponents in the All-Ireland semi-final were Tipperary, the Munster runners-up. On that occasion Wexford were outclassed by Tipp who won by 2-16 to 0-15.

In 1991, the separate South African Cricket Union and the South African Cricket Board merged to form the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCB), ending enforced racial separation governance in South African cricket. Cricket South Africa was formed in 2002, and initially ran parallel to the UCB, before becoming the sole governing body in 2008. As an affiliate of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC), and a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC), CSA administers all levels of cricket in South Africa, including the national teams in all three formats for both men and women.\n\nHistory\n\nBackground \nOrganised cricket has been taking place in South Africa since the British first introduced the sport in the 1880s. England were the first side to tour South Africa in 1888-89, playing their first Test match at Port Elizabeth and becoming the third Test playing nation after England and Australia. \n\nSince 1890, various national bodies have formed and governed cricket in South Africa. Originally, this was along separate racial lines and South Africa regularly played only against the other white teams of England, Australia and New Zealand. In 1970, after recent incidents such as the D'Oliveira affair, the ICC imposed an cricketing ban on South Africa in response to its domestic policy of apartheid and its refusal to field non-whites or play non-white teams. When the ban was enforced, South Africa was arguably the best team in the world after recent victories over England and Australia. The Test careers of hugely talented players were cut prematurely short, some of whom later emigrated and played for other nations.\n\nDuring South Africa\u2019s expulsion from international cricket, a number of different organisations ran domestic cricket depending on the various racial groups. The South African Cricket Association (SACA) administered white players, with the South African Cricket Board of Control (SACBOC) and the South African African Cricket Board (SAACB) administrating the different non-white racial groups. The effect of the cricketing boycott had a significant impact on the domestic game. Standards, attendances and participation fell, and while the game had been revolutionised by the introduction of the Cricket World Cup in 1975, South African expulsion meant that domestic cricket became deprived of new revenue streams. \n\nBy 1976, in a dramatic turn away from official government policy, the three organisations agreed to establish one single board to govern South African cricket, and that all future cricket would be played on an integrated and purely meritocratic basis, regardless of race or colour. Termed \u2018normal\u2019 cricket, it was hoped this would enable re-admission to the ICC, however, the new South African Cricket Union (SACU) was rejected by many non-white players who saw it as a feeble gesture within the wider context of apartheid. The South African Cricket Board (SACB) was subsequently organised to administer cricket for those non-whites that refused to join the SACU.\n\nAs South African cricket continued to be excluded, \u2018Rebel Tours\u2019 (unofficial international teams coming to South Africa to play), were organised by the SACU during the 1980s. Despite intense disapproval by international cricket boards, national governments and the ICC, seven tours were staged in South Africa between 1982 and 1990. Players who joined \u2018rebel tours\u2019 ran considerable risks to their own careers and reputations. Many faced ostracization when they returned home, as well as a cricketing ban. The SACU offered substantial amounts of money as an incentive for Rebel Teams to tour, particularly in an age when many cricketers did not earn high wages. Teams from England, Australia, and also the West Indies and Sri Lanka played 19 Tests and numerous One Day Internationals between them against South Africa in these unofficial tours.\n\nIn June 1991, the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCB) was established following the unity process and the amalgamation of the SACU and the SACB, finally ending racial segregation within South African cricket. Former SACB president Krish Mackerdhuj was elected as the inaugural UCB president. In July, South Africa was readmitted as a full member of the ICC, playing its first sanctioned international match since 1970 against India in November, and their first ever Test match against the West Indies in April 1992.\n\nIn 2002, Cricket South Africa (CSA) was formed and operated in conjunction with the UCB. CSA was responsible for and administered the professional game, and the UCB oversaw amateur cricket in South Africa. In 2008, CSA and the UCB merged, reportedly for tax reasons, with CSA becoming the sole governing body for both professionals and amateurs.\n\nMismanagement \nIn recent years, Cricket South Africa was rocked by significant amounts of turmoil and disorganisation that has caused notable reputational harm, both at home and abroad. \n\nIn 2012 Gerald Majola, CEO of CSA since 2000, was suspended and later dismissed following a scandal into unauthorised bonuses. An internal investigation had initially exonerated Majola of any wrongdoing, however a government inquiry later found that he, and several other staff members, had failed to declare a collective US$671,428 in bonuses after South Africa hosted of the 2009 IPL and Champions Trophy. Both CSA President Mtytzeli Nyoka and his acting replacement, AK Khan, resigned in the aftermath of the scandal. The government inquiry subsequently recommended that CSA should be restructured. \n\nHaroon Lorgat, CEO since 2013, 'mutually agreed to part ways with immediate effect' from CSA in September 2017 after his position became untenable following allegations that he had deliberately withheld critical financial information from the board of directors. Lorgat had been embattled with the CSA board over the financial expenditure of the now abandoned Global League T20. With tournament outlay alone totalling US$330,000 between May 2016 and April 2017, the league had yet to secure a broadcaster and title sponsor a month before the competition was due to start.\n\nUnder Thanang Moroe, CEO from 2017 to 2020, Cricket South Africa spiralled into numerous crises. A series of high-profile controversies and disagreements with the South African Cricketers Association relating to league restructuring, broadcasting rights, and various administration issues overtook CSA. In December 2019 Moroe was suspended, and later dismissed, following an independent forensic report that had uncovered multiple incidents of financial dishonesty where board money had been paid to private companies for a service that was never delivered. Throughout this time, CSA had refused to publish the final non-redacted Funduszi Report that had investigated alleged wrongdoing and negligence dating back to 2016 within the organisation. As a consequence, in October 2020 the entire Board of Directors resigned with immediate effect. The South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) announced that they had suspended Cricket South Africa due to \u2018maladministration and malpractices\u2019, and had taken over cricketing operations in the country. The acting CEO since July 2020, Kugandrie Govender, (the first woman in the position) herself was suspended four months later, pending the outcome of a hearing into allegations of misconduct during her time as Chief Commercial Officer, as well as acting CEO. She was later dismissed with immediate effect in July 2021.  \n\nIn January 2021, Cricket South Africa appointed Pholetsi Moseki, the former CFO, as acting CEO - the third CEO since the beginning of 2020. In April, the interim board and the Members Council reached an agreement over organisational reforms at the eleventh hour after the South African Government threatened to defund the organisation and remove recognition for all the country's national teams - effectively ending organised cricket in the country. The International Cricket Council had also announced that it could suspend South Africa due to government interference in the sport, which is against ICC rules. Zimbabwe Cricket has twice been suspended for political intervention by the ICC, most recently in 2019.\n\nNew Era \n\nIn June 2021, a new board of directors was appointed. For the first time, the majority of the board is made up of independents (i.e, outside CSA current administrative or operational circles), and was heralded as a new era for the organisation both domestically and internationally, with the return of administrative professionalism and long-term stability to the sport.\n\nOrganisation\n\nStructure \nCSA is currently governed by two internal organisation structures with a joint purpose of delivering responsible administration of the game, as well as to nurture sustainable growth and business investment for South African cricket.\n\nThe Board of Directors of CSA is generally composed of 12 directors that are elected to serve a three year term, each director however is eligible to have that term extended by another three years. The Board currently contains seven non-independent directors - those involved in cricket - and five independent directors that are employed to bring outside experience on legal, accounting and business matters to CSA. Strategic direction, formulation of policy and management of daily operations is the primary responsibility of the Board of Directors, and is performed through the governance framework of CSA committees and internal control procedures.\n\nThe Members Council is the highest authority within CSA, and is currently composed of 14 Presidents of the affiliated Provincial cricket unions. Two Provincial Presidents are also themselves elected as President and Vice-President of CSA. All major decisions taken by the Board of Directors must be debated and ratified by the Members Council. Throughout, close consultation is kept with the South African Cricketers Association (SACA), who represent the interests and welfare of the players.\n\nCSA\u2019s current interim Board of Directors, chaired by Zak Yacoob, has been in place since the mass resignation of all Board Directors in October 2020 following the decision by the suspension of CSA in the wake of repeated allegations of serious misconduct and malpractices. With their tenure lasting until February 2021, it has been announced by the interim Board that they are proposing an end to the current arrangement of two separate structures within CSA, and that the Board of Directors be made the sole seat of authority going forward. To ensure the independence of the CSA organisation, it has also recommended that more independent directors join the board. Currently, seven Provincial Presidents are non-independent directors on the board, as well as serving on the Members Council, potentially leading to large scale conflict of interests with CSA decision making.\n\nTransformation \nCSA maintain that their continued vision is to ensure that cricket is supported by the majority of South Africans, and that the game is available to all. Although a previous racial quota was repealed in 2007, since 2016 \u2018transformation\u2019 targets, although highly controversial, have been set by CSA in order to ensure that more South Africans of colour achieve greater representation at the national level. The percentage of black African players required in a team currently stands at 25%, up from 18% the previous season. In 2021-22, this will increase to 27% and in 2022-23, it will sit at 33%. Overall, the numbers of players of colour required will increase to 63% by 2022-23, from the current 58%. National teams must field six players of colour, of which at least two must be black African. These quotas however are for an average across the course of a season and are not enforced for individual matches. A further memorandum had stated from August 2020\u00a0that white consultants would no longer be appointed by CSA unless a person of colour could not be found during the recruitment process. In January 2021, it was announced by the interim board that all previous transformation targets adopted by CSA, including the affirmative action against hiring white consultants, would be suspended for the foreseeable future.\n\nNational Teams - The Proteas\n\nMen's \nTest - Having hosted and played their first international first-class game against England in 1888-89, South Africa developed into a competitive team by the start of the 20th century. Arguably the best team in the world when the ICC imposed an international ban on South Africa in 1970, since re-administration in 1991 South Africa have reasserted themselves as a strong team. Although at times holding the number one position in the international rankings, they have only had one success in an ICC organised tournament, the 1998 Champions Trophy.\n\nODI - Playing their first One Day International against India soon after readmittance in 1991, South Africa have reached the ODI World Cup Semi-Finals four times, most recently in 2015, but never progressed further. \n\nT20I - South Africa played their first T20I against New Zealand in 2005. Much like the other national squads, the T20I teams fortunes have varied and have been close to silverware. Appearing in 7 T20 World Cups, the Proteas have been semi-finalists twice, most recently in 2014.\n\nWomen\u2019s \nTest - Making their debut in 1960 against England, the women\u2019s team did not play any international fixtures between 1972 and 1997. Despite being the oldest form of women\u2019s cricket in South Africa, the Proteas have played just 13 Test matches, with the most recent being in 2022 and winning only one. With a win rate of only 8%, T20 has taken on a far more prominent and financially rewarding role, almost ending women's Test cricket as a viable entity.\n\nODI - The women\u2019s team played their first One Day International against Ireland in 1997, and have a current win rate of roughly 50% over nearly 200 matches. Playing in six Women\u2019s World Cups, the Proteas have been semi-finalists twice, in 2000 and 2017, although never progressing further. \n\nT20I - The Proteas\u2019 first T20I was in 2007 against Australia, and have since played over 100 matches. Competing in 6 Women\u2019s T20 World Cups, South Africa have been semi-finalists in 2014 and in 2020.\n\nDomestic Competitions \nCSA organises and oversees a range of domestic competitions within the country. \n\nFrom the 1892-93 season, first-class domestic cricket in South Africa emerged into the familiar province-based champion season. This competition format, with occasional changes and additions, survived until the 2004/05 season when the domestic structure was remodelled across all three formats to introduce six, entirely professional, franchise teams.\n\nIn 2021, Cricket South Africa announced a return to the traditional province based domestic structure. 15 first-class teams now play in two divisions, determined by promotion and relegation. Eight teams make up the first division, with 16 contracted players each, and seven teams the second division, with 11 contracted players each. CSA believes that the new format will provide more opportunities for players to compete at a high standard just below international cricket, in turn providing a wider talent pool for the national selectors. It is hoped that wider selection of teams at the highest domestic level will help increase playing opportunities of all races, particularly those currently underrepresented.\n\nSouth Africa's major domestic competitions are:\n\nFirst Class - CSA 4-Day Series \n\nList A - CSA One Day Cup\n\nT20 - CSA T20 League \n\nFor women, CSA Provincial Cricket is currently the top level of cricket in South Africa, however it remains semi-professional. Since 2019, South African women have played in the Women's T20 Super League. Further developing the women\u2019s game at a high level, CSA have said that the competition will allow top performing players from across the under-19s and provincial cricket to continue and improve domestic standards, as well as ultimately strengthening the national limited over sides.\n\nDevelopment, Youth and Grass Roots \nCricket South Africa offers numerous programmes that cover all aspects of the development of the amateur and professional game, for both men and women. From school projects, to introduction of hard ball cricket, through the semi-professional and fully professional franchise system, and then the pinnacle of international cricket.\n\nAs the majority of South African schools do not have the necessary support infrastructure in place, CSA provides regional and district programmes, often via their Performance Centres. KFC Mini-Cricket is usually the first introduction to cricket that South African boys and girls enjoy. Starting at the ages of four to thirteen, more than 126,000 school children have participated in the programme, while the number of coaches and schools participating has increased to nearly 14,000 and 7,000 respectively. \u00a0\n\nNational inter-provincial tournaments are played at under-13, under-15, under-17 and under-19 levels for boys, and at under-15 and under-19 levels for girls. Through the Talent Acceleration Programme, the best players can be identified, particularly disadvantaged cricketers, without any bias against their background or circumstance. Numerous initiatives are available that provide financial support for deprived young cricketers, through the Sunfoil Education Trust (SET), the Momentum Bursary Trust, and the SASCOC Bursary Programme. From Youth to International progression, CSA nourishes talent through multiple Provincial and Regional Academies, as well the National Academy and the High Performance Centre.\n\nFinances and Sponsorship \nIn the preceding years before Covid-19, CSA had reported a declared loss of R200m for the 2018-19 financial year, and profit of R50m for 2019-20. Due to the pandemic, as well as organisational instability, CSA forecasted major losses of R654m (\u00a332m) by the end of its four year in 2022 due to the effect on hosting tours, introducing the Mzanzi Super League, and restructuring the domestic game. Whilst the SA Cricketers Association puts that figure closer to R1bn (\u00a350m), CSA now project a revised figure of R400 (\u00a319m) due to tours going ahead and new sponsorship agreements. So far, CSA has not undertaken any job or pay cuts and has reported cash reserves of R800m (\u00a339m). Although facing a tough financial period and COVID consequences, CSA have agreed a major broadcast deal with Star India in November 2020 for a reported R1.5bn (\u00a372m) over the next four years to 2024. Another arrangement with South African broadcaster SuperSport is set to be negotiated before April 2021, alongside potential new sponsorship deals and existing television rights.\n\nIn September 2020, the financial services giant Momentum confirmed that it would not seek to renew its sponsorship agreement with CSA, affecting the ODIs, the franchise one-day cup, the national club champions, the under-13, under-15 and under-17 competitions and initiatives. Momentum will however continue to sponsor the national women\u2019s team under 2023, but have stated they will continue to advise CSA to resolve its administrative plight as a matter of urgency. Momentum is the not the only major sponsor to separate from CSA since the start of its instability crisis in December 2019. Standard Bank have opted not to continue their support for the national Test team, as well as the CSA development programmes. The sunflower oil producer Sunfoil, who had sponsored the first-class four day competition, similarly decided not to renew their sponsorship in 2019.\n\nSee also\nSouth Africa national cricket team\nCricket in South Africa\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n Wisden Cricketers Almanack\n\nExternal links\nCricket South Africa web site\nOfficial Facebook page\nCricinfo\nSouth Africa Cricket News\nCricinfo: South Africa - First-class teams\nICC\n\nCricket administration in South Africa\nOrganisations based in Johannesburg\nSports governing bodies in South Africa\nSports organizations established in 1991\n1991 establishments in South Africa", "The Hohe Villerspitze is a mountain, , in the Southeastern Sellrain Mountains (S\u00fcd\u00f6stlichen Sellrainer Bergen), a sub-group of the northern Stubai Alps in the Austrian state of Tyrol.

In 1952, he obtained the title of Procurator before completing his law degree as Lawyer (he did five and a half of the six years required for the law degree).\n\nUnion leadership\nDuring his time in Montevideo, he joined the socialist youth movement of the Socialist Party of Uruguay, becoming a prominent member. His social activity intensified during the 1950s, as he became trade union attorney of rural workers and, later, union founder. UTAA (sugar cane workers), SUDA (sugar beet workers) and the project for an all-inclusive association of rural workers, SUDOR, were born as a result of his actions. Sendic both saw and experienced the abuse by agricultural employers in areas where there seemed to be no awareness of democracy. In the late 1950s Sendic started a campaign to create social awareness of the cane workers' situation in Montevideo. Four hundred workers marched to Montevideo with the motto \"For the land and with Sendic\" (). The marchers were repeatedly repressed.\n\nFounding of Tupamaros\nHence, Sendic began to think that the only option for the country was terrorist violence that should complement the workers' requests. In 1963, the Tupamaros robbed an arms shop in Colonia to found a guerrilla movement. However, the MLN-T began to be recognised because of its activities only in 1967, when government repression, during the presidency of Jorge Pacheco Areco, caused the mobilization and response of a variety of groups, principally the Tupamaros.\n\nMLN-T began by staging the robbing of banks, gun clubs and other businesses in the early 1960s, then distributing stolen food and money among the poor in Montevideo. By the late 1960s, it was engaged in political kidnappings, armed propaganda and assassinations. The group kidnapped bank manager Pereyra Rebervel and the United Kingdom ambassador to Uruguay, Geoffrey Jackson, as well as kidnapping and murdering Dan Mitrione, an FBI agent alleged to have taught techniques of torture to police forces in various Latin American countries.\n\nThe peak of the Tupamaros was in 1970 and 1971. During this period they made liberal use of their \"People's Prison\" () where they held those that they kidnapped. In 1971 over 100 imprisoned Tupamaros escaped the Punta Carretas prison. Nonetheless, the movement was hampered by a series of events including serious strategic gaffes and the betrayal of high-ranking Tupamaro H\u00e9ctor Amodio P\u00e9rez, police officers who were granted liberal repressive powers to deal with Tupamaros. Sendic was arrested in Uruguay on 7 August 1970, and remained in prison until his escape 6 September 1971. The mass escape of the year 71 caused the civilian authority to call the Uruguayan military to lead the operations (so far being undertaken by the police). Sendic remained in Uruguay as a fugitive until his eventual capture one year later. The Tupamaros lead an increase on their aggressive activities during the massacres of April the 14th and May the 18th. \n\nThis caused the Uruguayan military to unleashed a series of operations and mass arrests, dispersing those guerrillas who were not killed or arrested. The tactics were incredibly effective, and by the end of 1972, the MLN-T had been severely weakened. Its principal leaders were imprisoned under for the next 12 years. Despite the diminished threat, the civilian government of Juan Mar\u00eda Bordaberry ceded governmental authority to the military in 1973 in a bloodless coup d'\u00e9tat that led to further repression against the population and the suppression of all political parties.\n\nSecond imprisonment\nRa\u00fal Sendic and eight of the MLN-T leaders were confined to different improvised prisons in poor conditions for 12 years. They suffered continuous physical and psychological torture. After the military dictatorship fell in 1985, Sendic was released from prison.  The Tupamaros returned to public life as part of a political party, the Movement of Popular Participation. Today, the party comprises the largest single group within the ruling left-wing Frente Amplio coalition.\n\nUnited Nations complaint\nIn November 1979, Sendic's wife, Violeta Setelich, submitted a complaint to the United Nations Human Rights Committee on his behalf, alleging breaches of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), a treaty to which Uruguay is a party.  In October 1981, the Committee found that Uruguay violated articles 7, 9, 10 and 14 of the ICCPR in respect of Sendic during his trial and imprisonment.\n\nDeath and legacy\nSendic died in Paris in 1989, aged 63, of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  His funeral was held in Montevideo, where he was buried. His son, Ra\u00fal Fernando Sendic Rodr\u00edguez, is a former Vice President of Uruguay, having also served as Industry Minister.\n\nSee also\n List of political families#Uruguay\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n La tierra: un tema tab\u00fa que vuelve, Ra\u00fal Sendic, 1987\n\n1926 births\n1989 deaths\nUruguayan people of Croatian descent\nUruguayan people of Italian descent\nPeople from Flores Department\nNeurological disease deaths in France\nDeaths from motor neuron disease\nUnited Nations Human Rights Committee case law\nUruguayan communists\nTerrorism in Uruguay\nMovement of Popular Participation politicians\nSocialist Party of Uruguay politicians\nUruguayan guerrillas\nBurials at Cementerio de La Teja, Montevideo\n\nel:\u03a4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2", "KNLS is an international shortwave radio station near Anchor Point, Alaska, United States. The station is operated by World Christian Broadcasting, a non-profit company based in the United States. KNLS broadcasts 20 hours a day of Christian-themed programming in Chinese, English and Russian.\n\nHistory\n\nThe idea for KNLS came about during World War II, when Maurice Hall, a young Army Signal Corps officer, was involved in delivering shortwave radio transmitters to the Yalta Conference so that President Franklin D. Roosevelt could stay informed of news from Washington. Hall, a devout Christian, realized that Christian programming could also be sent to the entire world in the same way. After World War II, Hall became a minister, educator and missionary, but still dreamed of an international shortwave station that would reach the entire world with Gospel messages.\n\nIn 1976, World Christian Broadcasting Corporation was formed and work began on making the station a reality. The following year, Lowell Perry, one of the founding directors, was killed in a plane crash during a mission to find a transmitter site. In 1979, land was purchased in Alaska and a transmitter was built.\n\nKNLS signed on the air July 23, 1983, broadcasting ten hours a day in Mandarin Chinese and Russian and reaching roughly one-third of the world. English was added later. As the Soviet Union\u2019s empire fell apart, listeners from those countries began writing and requesting Bibles and other religious materials. In 2005, the station signed on a second transmitter in Alaska.\n\nKNLS today\n\nKNLS is on the air each day for ten hours in Mandarin, five in Russian and five in English. Programming is produced at the station\u2019s Operations Center in Franklin, Tennessee, a suburb of Nashville. Programs are presented in a magazine-style format and provide Bible and religious teaching segments and reports about life in America as well as music.\n\nKNLS never asks listeners to send money.

He is said to have died during the persecutions of the Emperor Galerius on April 2 in or around the year 305.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox calendar, his feast thus falls on April 2, along with Edesius (Aedisius), who is sometimes called his brother.\n\nOrigins\nHe was from Lycia, and his wealthy and distinguished parents gave him the best education possible in rhetoric, law, and philosophy in the famous school of Berytus in Phoenicia. While he was away at school, he became a Christian.  Aphian withdrew to Cappadocia because his parents resisted his efforts to convert them to Christianity.\n\nMartyrdom\nPamphilus was at Caesarea Maritima at the time of Aphian's martyrdom, expounding Holy Scripture, and the young Aphian was one of his disciples. He lived at the house of Eusebius, but gave no intimation of his purpose to make the public protest which ended in his martyrdom. \n\nAccording to his legend, he was only eighteen when he entered the temple at Caesarea Maritima, where the prefect Urbanus was offering sacrifice. Seizing the outstretched hand that was presenting the incense, he reproached the magistrate for his idolatrous act. The guards fell upon him furiously and, after cruelly torturing him, flung him into a dungeon. The next day he was brought before the prefect, torn with iron claws, beaten with clubs, and burned over a slow fire, and then sent back to confinement. After three days he was again taken from prison and thrown into the sea with stones tied to his feet. Eusebius, an eyewitness, declares that an earthquake simultaneously shook the city, and that the sea flung up his corpse on the shore.\n\nFeast\nIn the old martyrologies his feast was on April 5, but the Bollandists give April 2 as the correct date.\n\nSee also\n4th century in Lebanon\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\nSaints of April 2: Amphianus\n San Amfiano\n\n287 births\n305 deaths\n4th-century Christian martyrs\n4th-century Romans\nPeople executed by drowning\nLycians\nChristians martyred during the reign of Diocletian\nPeople of Caesarea Maritima", "Andrew Nuttall (born 7 September 1957) is a New Zealand cricketer.

He holds a best of 20.13 seconds for the distance, set in 2018.\n\nBiography\nOf Nigerian descent, he acquired Italian citizenship in 2012, at 18 years old as he was born in Casalmaggiore, Italy, to Nigerian parents. Desalu originally focused on association football in his youth. However, he began to take up track and field around 2008, initially focusing on the sprint hurdles. His speed was better than his technique and he eventually focused on the 200\u00a0m instead. He gained full Italian citizenship in 2012. A member of Gruppi Sportivi Fiamme Gialle \u2013 the sports club of Italy's fiscal police force \u2013 he made his international debut at the 2012 World Junior Championships in Athletics. However, he failed to progress beyond the heats. He also ran with the 4\u00d7100 metres relay team, but they were also eliminated in the heats stage.\n\nDesalu's first international medal came at the 2013 European Athletics Junior Championships, where he was a relay bronze medallist on home turf in Rieti, running the anchor leg on a team of Giacomo Isolano, Lorenzo Bilotti and Roberto Rigali. He also managed fifth place individually in the 200\u00a0m. His first senior medal followed at the 2014 European Team Championships, where he was part of the bronze medal-winning relay quartet alongside Massimiliano Ferraro, Diego Marani, and Delmas Obou. He was selected both individually and for the relay for Italy at the 2014 European Athletics Championships. He was a semi-finalist in the 200\u00a0m, having set a best of 20.55 seconds in the heats, and was a finalist in the relay with Fabio Cerutti, Marani and Obou (although the Italians failed to finish).\n\nDesalu had his first appearance at global senior level at the 2015 IAAF World Relays, though the regrouped European Championships team did not make it past the heats. At the 2015 Military World Games he won the 200\u00a0m gold medal, a tenth of a second ahead of runner-up Serhiy Smelyk. He came close to a second medal at the games in the relay, placing fourth with Cerutti, Obou and Matteo Galvan.\n\nIn La Chaux-de-Fonds, he runs in 20.36 on 15 August 2020, best European performance of the year on 200 m.

The radial planes need not be perfectly drawn to overlap on an exact intersection point, particularly when the body part being sectioned is not a perfect cylinder, such as in the case of the maxilla and mandible.\n\nUsefulness\nThe radial plane can be useful because certain anatomical elements repeat in a circumferential manner (such as around the curvature of the dental arch (i.e. the jaw) and to speak of these entities using parallel planes becomes cumbersome and inaccurate.\n\nFor instance, the segment of bone on the outer circumference of each individual tooth is referred to as the facial plate of bone. Because the facial plate of bone is anterior to the incisors (in the front of the mouth) but lateral to the premolars and molars (in the back of the mouth), to visualize the facial plate of bone on various teeth will require sagittal slices for the former but coronal slices for the latter. To achieve greater uniformity and diminished confusion, simply speaking of radial slices provides a satisfactory solution for all teeth in both (upper and lower) arches.\n\nPrevious to the advent of this terminology, this plane was referred to as the axial plane relative to the body of the jawbone.

He used to carry a little organ around with him to work on.\" The recording was released on the 1950 Decca LP Dixieland Jazz, 1934-1935, Volume 1 by the Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra, DL 6016, as an album of 78s as A-689, and as an album of 45s as 9-255, the 1999 Avid compilation The Dorsey Brothers, the 2010 Hallmark album Bring Back The Good Times, the 2006 album Essential Collection on West End Records, the Circle collection The Dorsey Brothers Orchestra, 1935, and the 2010 Hallmark collection The Fabulous Dorseys Play Dixieland Jazz.\n\nOther recordings\n\nRay Noble and his American Dance Orchestra performed \"Dese Dem Dose\" as part of a medley, \"Dese Dem Dose/An Hour Ago This Minute/Solitude\", on April 17, 1935 live at the Rainbow Room in New York which was recorded and broadcast and released in 2008 on the live CD by Galaxy Music, The Rainbow Room New York Presents Ray Noble & His American Dance Orchestra: Original Live-Recordings 1935 and the 2011 album The Very Best Of Ray Noble & His American Dance Orchestra on Platinum Collection. The radio announcer introduced the performance as follows: \"'Dese, Dem, and Dose'. Hot and fast but still with that underlying note of sophistication that distinguishes Ray Noble's music.\" Glenn Miller was in the Ray Noble orchestra at the time on trombone and had organized and rehearsed the band. Glenn Miller also appeared with the Ray Noble Orchestra that year in the Hollywood movie musical The Big Broadcast of 1936 (1935). Ray Noble paid Glenn Miller \"for working on The Big Broadcast of 1936, so that Glenn's total weekly pay ranged from a one-week low of $130 to a one-week high of $356.\"\n\nJazz trumpeter Billy Butterfield and Andy Bartha performed \"Dese Dem Dose\" in the early 1970s, a performance which was released on the 2005 live album Take Me to the Land of Jazz. \"Dese Dem Dose\" was released in 2008 by the Colorado jazz band The Jazz Cookers on their album Live At Brix.\n\nPersonnel\n\nThe Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra consisted of the following members in 1934-1935: Ray McKinley on drums; Skeets Herfurt on tenor sax; Delmar Kaplan on bass; Bobby Van Epps on piano; Roc Hillman on guitar; Don Mattison on trombone; Kay Weber on vocals; Jack Stacey on alto sax; George Thow on trumpet; Tommy Dorsey on trombone; Jimmy Dorsey on alto sax; and, Glenn Miller on trombone. Glenn Miller was also an arranger in the band. Charlie Spivak and Bob Crosby were also members during this period.\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n\n Simon, George Thomas. Glenn Miller and His Orchestra.

Over the course of his career with Marvel Comics and DC Comics, Rosen lettered such titles as The Fantastic Four, Captain America, Daredevil, Spider-Man, G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, The Incredible Hulk, The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones, and X-Factor. He also lettered the DC/Marvel intercompany crossover book Superman and Spider-Man.\n\nBiography\nRosen started his career in the production department of Fawcett Comics, where he worked from 1940 to 1943. He then joined DC Comics' production department, lettering at that publisher until the mid-1950s. By then he had established a prolific freelance career, including with Harvey Comics, where he was known as speedy, professional, and a \"quiet fellow.\" Rosen lettered almost exclusively for Harvey throughout the rest of the 1950s.\n\nIn the 1960s and early 1970s, Rosen created pencil artwork for the DC Comics romance title Girls' Love Stories. From 1969 to 1971 he also drew stories for DC's Secret Hearts. In the 1960s, while continuing to letter for DC and Harvey, Rosen also lettered for Marvel Comics, occasionally in 1968\u201369, and regularly from 1974 onward. Beginning in the 1980s, and throughout the rest of his career, Rosen worked almost exclusively for Marvel.\n\nIn 1975 he began lettering Daredevil. Rosen would work on 127 issues of the comic over 16 years.\n\nHis brother was Sam Rosen, also a long-time Marvel Comics letterer. Joe Rosen died October 12, 2009.\n\nTributes \nTom Spurgeon, the Comics Reporter:\n\nRick Parker, long-time letterer:\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\n Kraft, David Anthony.

As a linguistic concept, known usually  as gallicization, it is the practice of modifying foreign words, names, and phrases to make them easier to spell, pronounce, or understand in French. \n\nAccording to the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF), the figure of 220 million Francophones (French-language speakers) is  (under-evaluated) because it only counts people who can write, understand and speak French fluently, thus excluding a majority of African French-speaking people, who do not know how to write. The French Conseil \u00e9conomique, social et environnemental estimate that were they included, the total number of French speakers passed 500 million in the year 2000. French has the world's fastest-growing relative share of speakers.\n\nIn 2014, a study from the French bank Natixis claimed French will become the world's most-spoken language by 2050. However, critics of the study state that French coexists with other languages in many countries and the study's estimates are prone to exaggeration.\n\nThe number of Francophones in the world has been rising substantially since the 1980s. In 1985, there were 106 million Francophones around the world. That number quickly rose to 173.2 million in 1997, 200 million in 2005, 220 million in 2010 (+10% from 2007). and reached 274 million in 2014. Forecasts expect that the number of French speakers in Africa alone will reach 400 million in 2025, 715 million (readjusted in 2010) by 2050 and reach 1 billion and 222 million in 2060 (readjusted in 2013). The worldwide French-speaking population is expected to quadruple, whereas the world population is predicted to grow by half.\n\nAfrica \n\nAfrica has 32 French-speaking countries, more than half its total (53); French was also the most widely spoken language in Africa in 2015.\n\nHowever, Nigeria, the most populous country on the continent, is predominantly English speaking.\n\nThe Francophone zone of Africa is two times the size of the United States of America (including Alaska).\n\nFrench was introduced in Africa by France and Belgium during the colonial period. The process of francization continued after the colonial period, so that English-speaking countries like Ghana or Nigeria feel strong French influences from their French-speaking neighbours.\n\nFrench became the most spoken language in Africa after Arabic and Swahili in 2010. The number of speakers changed very rapidly between 1992 and 2002, with the number of French learners in sub-Saharan Africa increasing by 60.37%, from 22.33 million to 34.56 million people. A similar trend in the Maghreb region is occurring. However, as figures provided by the OIF for the Maghreb region were combined with those of the Middle East, the exact count for the Maghreb countries alone is not possible. In this larger region (Maghreb and Middle East), an increase from 10.47 million to 18 million people learning French was observed between 1992 and 2002.\n\nConsideration should be given to the number of French speakers in each country to get an idea of the importance the French language holds in Africa.\n\nMany African countries without French as an official language have recently joined the OIF in view of francizing their countries:\nCape Verde (official language: Portuguese)\nEgypt (official language: Arabic)\nGhana (official language: English)\nGuinea Bissau (official language: Portuguese)\nMozambique (official language: Portuguese)\nS\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe (official language: Portuguese)\n\nThe French language currently plays an important role in Africa, serving more and more as a common language or mother tongue (in Gabon, Ivory Coast, Congo, Cameroon and Benin in particular). The African Academy of Languages was established in 2001 to manage the linguistic heritage.\n\nFrancophone African countries counted 370 million inhabitants in 2014. This number is expected to reach between 700 and 750 million by 2050. There are already more francophones in Africa than in Europe.\n\nAsia\nVietnam, Cambodia and Laos were once part of French Indochina, part of the French Empire. French culture, in aspects of architecture, culinary and linguistics, have been integrated into the local ones, although the latter remained highly distinct. French language used to be the official language and was considerably popular and influential in these colonies, but after they were decolonised and gained independence, the new governments generally removed its influence, by implementing the native language as the only official language in the newly independent states. Currently, the presence of French language in these countries are negligibly minor.\n\nEurope\n\nEngland \nEngland, and therefore the English language, was deeply francized during the Middle Ages. This was a result of the conquest of England by William the Conqueror from Normandy in 1066, a king who spoke exclusively French and imposed the French language in England. Old English became the language of the poor population and French the language of the court and wealthy population. It is said that during this period, people in England spoke more French than those in France. Today, it is estimated that 50% to 60% of the English language comes from French or Latin.\n\nCookery gives a good example of this tendency: the names of many farm animals have Anglo-Saxon roots. However, the names of their meat (once exclusive to the wealthy) have Old French origins:\n\nPig (Anglo-Saxon) \u2013 Pork from the Old French \nCow (Anglo-Saxon ) \u2013 Beef from the Old French \nChicken (Anglo-Saxon) \u2013 Poultry from the Old French  or \nSheep (Anglo-Saxon )  \u2013 Mutton from the Old French\n\nFrance  \n\n\"Francization\" is also used to mean any of many cultural assimilation policies implemented by French authorities since the French Revolution. These aimed to impose or maintain the dominance of the French language and French culture. Before the Revolution, French was still a minority language in France by number of speakers, but was the prestige language.  The Ordinance of Villers-Cotter\u00eats under King Francis I of France prescribed the official use of the French language, the langue d'o\u00efl dialect spoken at the time in the \u00cele-de-France, in all documents. Other languages, such as Occitan, began to disappear as written languages.\n\nWith the decline of Latin, French became increasingly important for writing. Often, people were encouraged or compelled to adopt French, thereby developing a French identity at the expense of their existing one. Use of other languages was often suppressed. This occurred, for example, among the Alemannic-speaking inhabitants of Alsace and the Lorraine Franconian-speaking inhabitants of Lorraine after these regions were conquered by Louis XIV during the seventeenth century, to the Flemings in French Flanders, to the Occitans in Occitania, and to Basques, Bretons, Catalans, Corsicans and Ni\u00e7ards.\n\nShortly after the fall of the Ancien R\u00e9gime, the new revolutionary government adopted a policy of promotion of French as a unifying and modernizing language, simultaneously denigrating the status of minority languages as bulwarks of feudalism, Church control of the state, and backwardness in general. In less than a year after coming to power (1792), the Committee for Public Instruction mandated that the newly-expanded public education be fortified by sending French-speaking teachers to areas that spoke other languages. This programme achieved many of its aims during the 19th century: by the 1860s, nearly 80% of the national population could speak French.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Turin was signed in 1860 between the Victor Emmanuel II and Napoleon III as a consequence of the Plombi\u00e8res Agreement, the County of Nice was ceded to France as a territorial reward for French assistance in the Second Italian War of Independence against Austria, which saw Lombardy united with Piedmont-Sardinia. The Italian language was the official language of the County of Nice, used by the Church, at the town hall, taught in schools, used in theaters and at the Opera, was immediately abolished and replaced by French. The French government implemented a policy of Francization of society, language and culture of the County of Nice. The toponyms of the communes of the ancient County have been francized, which acted as a bank to the obligation to use French in Nice, as well as certain surnames (for example the Italian surname \"Bianchi\" was francized into \"Leblanc\", and the Italian surname \"Del Ponte\" was francized into \"Dupont\").\n\nBy 1900, French had become the mother tongue of the majority of adults in France. Jules Ferry introduced free, compulsory education during the French Third Republic, and openly tried to strengthen the centralised state by instilling a French national identity in the population. French was presented as the language of modernity, as opposed to regional languages such as Breton or Basque, labelled as barbaric or tribal. Pupils caught speaking these languages were punished by making them display tokens of shame. In Occitan-speaking areas that school policy was called the vergonha. \n\nHistorically, no official language was recognized by the French Constitution. In 1994, French was declared constitutionally to be the language of the French Republic. In 1998, France became a signatory of the European Charter on Minority Languages; however, it has yet to ratify it, with general agreement among the political class that supportive measures are neither popular enough to attract wide support nor banal enough to be uncontroversial, with concerns specifically about courts forcing the state to act if the rights enshrined in the charter are recognised. \n\nInitiatives to encourage the use of minority languages are limited by the refusal of the French Government to recognize them, on the basis of the French Constitution, which states that \"The language of the Republic of France is French\". This view was upheld in 2021, when Deputy Paul Molac unexpectedly won a majority vote in the French National Assembly to allow for immersive education in minority languages in state-run schools. The Assembly's decision was immediately contested by the French Constitutional Council, which struck out the parliament's vote. The Council also deemed unconstitutional the use of diacritical marks not used in French, such as the tilde in \"\u00f1\".\n\nBelgium\n\nBrussels and the Flemish periphery\n\nIn the last two centuries, Brussels transformed from an exclusively Dutch-speaking city to a bilingual city with French as the majority language and lingua franca. The language shift began in the eighteenth century and accelerated as Belgium became independent and Brussels expanded beyond its original city boundaries. From 1880 onwards, more and more Dutch-speaking people became bilingual, resulting in a rise of monolingual French speakers after 1910. Halfway through the twentieth century, the number of monolingual French-speakers carried the day over the (mostly) bilingual Flemish inhabitants. Only since the 1960s, after the fixation of the Belgian language border and the socio-economic development of Flanders was in full effect, could Dutch stem the tide of increasing French use. The francization of the Flemish periphery around Brussels still continues because of the continued immigration of French speakers coming from Wallonia and Brussels.\n\nNorth America\n\nCanada\n\nQuebec\n\nThe Government of Quebec has francization policies intended to establish French as the primary language of business and commerce. All businesses are required to provide written communications and schedules in French, and may not make knowledge of a language other than French a condition of hiring unless this is justified by the nature of the duties. Businesses with more than fifty employees are required to register with the Quebec Office of the French language in order to become eligible for a francization certificate, which is granted if the linguistic requirements are met. If not, employers are required to adopt a francization programme, which includes having employees, especially ones in managerial positions, who do not speak French or whose grasp of French is weak attend French-language training.\n\nAs part of the francization programme, the Quebec government provides free language courses for recent immigrants (from other countries or other provinces) who do not speak French or whose command of French is weak. The government also provides financial assistance for those who are unable to find employment because they are unable to speak French.\n\nAnother aspect of francization in Quebec regards the quality of the French used in Quebec. The Quebec Office of the French language has, since its formation, undertaken to discourage anglicisms and to promote high standards of French-language education in schools.\n\nThe francization programmes have been considered a great success. Since 1977 (the year the Charter of the French Language became law), the number of English speakers has decreased from 14% in 1970 to less than 6.7% in 2006. In the 1970s the French language was generally understood only by native French speakers, who were 80% of the population of Quebec. In 2001, French was understood by more than 94% of the population. Moreover, the number of immigrants sending their children to English schools fell from 80% in 1970 to less than 4% in 2006.\n\nFrench is also becoming increasingly attractive to foreign speakers, suggesting that the francization programmes have been successful.\n\nMontreal is a particular interesting case because, unlike the rest of Quebec, the French-speaking proportion of the population diminished. However, this does not mean that the francization programmes failed, as the share of English speakers diminished as well; it seems more likely that the decrease was caused by the fact that 93% of new immigrants to Quebec choose to settle in Montreal, with a corresponding rise in languages other than English and French. The government of Quebec estimates that, over the next 20 years, the Francophone proportion of Montreal will go back up.\n\nBut those estimations seem to underestimate the francization of Montreal for some experts, because statistics show that the proportion has already risen from 55.6% (1996) to 56.4% (2001).\n\nThe success of francization of Quebec can also be seen over the borders of its territory: in Ontario, the proportion of English speakers dropped from 70.5% in 2001 to 68% in 2006, while the proportion of French speakers went up from 4.06% (488 815) in 2006 to 4.80% (580 000) in 2009. However, this statistic must be examined in conjunction with the effects of Quebec francophone out-migration. Interprovincial migration, especially to Ontario, results in a net loss of population in Quebec. The number of French-speaking Quebecers leaving the province tends to be similar to the number entering, while immigrants to Quebec tend to leave.\n\nNone of the Quebec statistics are adjusted to compensate for the percentage\u2014approximately 20%\u2014of Anglophones who departed the province by the mid-1980s as a consequence of linguistic nationalism. By 2001, over 60% of the 1971 population of Quebec Anglophones had left the province.\n\nThe Charter of the French Language has been a complete success, according to Herv\u00e9 Lavenir de Buffon (general secretary of the \u00ab Comit\u00e9 international pour le fran\u00e7ais, langue europ\u00e9enne \u00bb), who said in 2006: \"Before Bill 101, Montreal looked like an American city. Now Montreal looks like a French-speaking city; that proves how well Bill 101 has worked!\"\n\nNew Brunswick \nThe policy has been even more successful in New Brunswick, for example: the city of Edmundston went from around 89% French-speaking in 1996 to 93.4% in 2006, the city of Moncton from 30.4% in 1996 to 33% in 2006, Dalhousie (from 42.5% to 49.5%) and Dieppe (from 71.1% in 1996 to 74.2% in 2006). Some cities even passed 50% of French speakers between 1991 and 2006 like Bathurst, which passed from 44.6% of French speakers in 1996 to 50.5% in 2006, or Campbellton, from 47% in 1996 to 55% in 2006.\n\nRates of francization may be established for any group by comparing the number of people who usually speak French to the total number of people in the minority language group. See Calvin Veltman's Language Shift in the United States (1983) for a discussion.\n\nOf the language\nThere are many examples of francization in history and popular culture:\n replacing the word \"custard\" on restaurant menus.\nAnne Boleyn choosing the French spelling Boleyn over the traditional English Bolin or Bullen.\nMary, Queen of Scots, choosing the spelling Stuart over Stewart for the name of her dynasty. (The Scots had dual nationality and Mary, Queen of Scots was brought up in France.)\nThe common \"-escu\" final particle in Romanian being traditionally changed to \"-esco\" in French spellings and being occasionally adopted by the persons themselves as a French equivalent of their names (see Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, Irina Ionesco, Marthe Bibesco).\n, short for , replacing e-mail (originally from Quebec).\n\nThe same exists for other languages, for example, English, in which case objects or persons can be anglicized.\n\nSee also\n\n Afrancesado, Spanish followers of French culture and politics in the 18th and 19th centuries\n Anglicism\n French colonial empire\n Gallicism\n List of French expressions in English\n\nReferences\n\nFrench nationalism\nFrancophonie\nNeologisms\nWord coinage\nTransliteration\nCultural assimilation", "Jim Irvin is an English singer, songwriter, music journalist and podcast host.\n\nEarly life\nBorn James Lawrence Irvin and raised in west London.\n\nCareer\n\nFurniture\nIrvin was the singer in the English new wave band Furniture, who released singles and albums with Survival, Stiff and Arista Records between 1982 and 1990. He co-wrote their 1986 UK hit single, \"Brilliant Mind\", taken from the album, The Wrong People. The song also appeared in the John Hughes movie, Some Kind of Wonderful and was re-recorded for the soundtrack. Furniture made one further album, Food, Sex & Paranoia, for Arista (1990), and disbanded in 1991. In 1992, Irvin recorded an album, Mad Scared Dumb and Gorgeous  with jazz musician Chris Ingham, under the name Because. It was released on Boo Hewerdine's Haven label.\n\nIn 2019, Emotional Rescue records reissued Furniture's debut, six-song mini-album, When the Boom Was On (1983) and an EP of 12\" mixes called On Broken Glass\n\nMusic journalism\nIn 1991, Irvin began contributing to Melody Maker magazine, where his work appeared under the name Jim Arundel. He was later made reviews editor. In 1994, reverting to Jim Irvin, he became the founding features editor of Mojo magazine. One of his most notable pieces for the magazine was \"Angel of Avalon\", a major profile of the late Sandy Denny, published in 1998. He also edited an acclaimed book, The Mojo Collection. He has written for The Word, Time Out, The Sunday Times and The Guardian and continues to write a reissues column for Mojo. \n\nIn February 2015, he published an e-book, A Book Of Wild Flowers, which collected his writings on Sandy Denny, Joni Mitchell and Kate Bush.\n\nIn May 2018, he co-authored Jeff Buckley: From Hallelujah To The Last Goodbye (Post Hill Press), a biography of Jeff Buckley written with Dave Lory, the singer's former manager.\n\nIn 2020, he launched a podcast, \u201cHere\u2019s One I Made Earlier\u201d where he interviewed musical creators about a significant work in their career. The following year he launched a second podcast \u201cYou\u2019re Not On The List\u201d dedicated to \u201cforgotten albums and the people who love them\u201d, in which guests nominate undervalued albums and discuss them.\n\nLater production and songwriting\nIn 1995, Irvin produced the first demos by the band Gay Dad, and co-write some of the songs which later appeared on their debut album, Leisure Noise. Their single, \"Oh Jim\", was said to be dedicated to him.\n\nIn 1999, he produced Lido, the debut album by Clearlake, released in 2000 on his own label, Dusty Company, an offshoot of Domino Records.\n\nIrvin returned to full-time songwriting in 2001, concentrating initially on dance music. He co-wrote the 2004 hit \"The Weekend\" by Michael Gray, and had work recorded by Groove Armada, Full Intention and David Guetta.\n\nSince 2006, his work has been mostly outside dance music, with artists like Lana Del Rey, Lissie, Simple Plan, Jack Savoretti, Unloved, Nothing but Thieves and Yungblud.\n\nThe song \"Love\", co-written with and performed by Unloved, introduced the Apple Keynote Speech in March 2019.\n\nDiscography\n\nBibliography\n\nEssays and reporting\n \n  Review of five albums by Fran\u00e7oise Hardy.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Radius Music\n\n1959 births\nLiving people\nEnglish rock singers\nEnglish rock keyboardists\nEnglish music journalists\nEnglish record producers\nEnglish songwriters\nEnglish new wave musicians\nEnglish house musicians\nMale new wave singers\nMusicians from London\nMojo (magazine) people", "The term Uttar\u0101ya\u1e47a (commonly Uttarayan) is derived from two different Sanskrit words \u2013 \"uttara\" (North) and \"ayana\" (movement) \u2013 thus indicating a semantic of the northward movement of the Sun on the celestial sphere. This movement begins to occur a day after the winter solstice in December, which occurs around 22 December and continues for a six-month period through to the summer solstice around June 21 (dates vary). This difference is because the solstices continually precess at a rate of 50 arcseconds per year due to the precession of the equinoxes, i.e. this difference is the difference between the sidereal and tropical zodiacs. The Surya Siddhanta bridges this difference by juxtaposing the four solstitial and equinoctial points with four of the twelve boundaries of the rashis.\n\nThe complement of Uttarayana is Dakshinayana, i.e. the period between Karka sankranti and Makara Sankranti as per the sidereal zodiac and between the Summer solstice and Winter solstice as per the tropical zodiac.\n\nDifference between Uttarayana and Makar Sankranti \nThere is a common misconception that Makar Sankranti marks the beginning of Uttarayana. This is because at one point in time Sayana and Nirayana zodiac were the same. Every year sidereal and tropical equinoxes slide by 50 seconds due to axial precession, giving birth to Ayanamsha and causing Makar Sankranti to slide further.  When equinox slides it will increase ayanamsha and Makar Sankranti will also slide. This misconception continues as there is not much difference between actual Uttarayana date which occurs a day after winter solstice (of Dec 21) when the sun makes the northward journey, and 14 January.  However, the difference will be significant as equinoxes slide further. In 272 AD, Makar Sankranti was on 21 December. In 1000 AD, Makar Sankranti was on 31 December and now it falls on January 14. After 9000 years, Makar Sankranti will be in June. Then Makar Sankranti would mark the beginning of Dakshinayana. However Makar Sankranti still holds importance in Hindu rituals. All Drika Panchanga makers like mypanchang.com, datepanchang, janmabhumi panchang, rashtriya panchang  and Vishuddha Siddhanta Panjika use the position of the tropical sun to determine Uttarayana and Dakshinayana.\n\nUttarayana in various treatises\n\nSurya Siddhanta \n\nMayasura, the composer of Surya Siddhanta, defines Uttarayana, at the time of composition, as the period between the Makara Sankranti (which currently occurs around January 14) and Karka Sankranti (which currently occurs around July 16). L\u0101tadeva describes this as half revolutions of the Sun, using the terms Uttarayana and Dakshinayana to describe the \"northern and southern progress\" respectively.  Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a scholar and mathematician, proposes an alternative, early vedic definition of Uttarayana as starting from Vernal Equinox and ending with Autumnal Equinox. This definition interprets the term \"Uttara Ayana\" as \"northern movement\" instead of \"northward movement\", i.e. as the movement of the Earth in the region North of the Equator. In support of this proposal, he points to another tradition that the Uttarayana is considered the daytime of the Gods residing at the North Pole which tradition makes sense only if we define Uttarayana as the period between the Vernal and Autumnal equinoxes (when there is Midnight Sun at the North Pole). Conversely, Dakshinaya is defined as the period between the Autumnal and Vernal Equinoxes, when there is midnight sun at the South Pole. This period is also referred to as Pitrayana (with the Pitrus (i.e. ancestors) being placed at the South Pole).\n\nDrik Siddhanta \n\nThis festival is currently celebrated on the 14th or 15th of January but due to axial precession of the earth it will continue to shift away from the actual season. The season occurs based on tropical sun (without ayanamsha). The earth revolves around sun with a tilt of 23.44 degrees. When the tilt is facing the sun we get summer and when the tilt is away from the sun we get winter. That is the reason when there is summer north of the equator, it will be winter south of the equator. Because of this tilt, the sun appears to travel north and south of the equator. This motion of the sun transitioning from south to north is called Uttarayana (the sun is moving towards north). Once the sun reaches north, it begins moving south and is called Dakshinayana \u2013 the sun is moving towards south. This causes seasons which are dependent on equinoxes and solstices.\n\nHindu Scriptures \nUttarayana is referred to as the day of new good healthy wealthy beginning. According to Kauravas and Pandavas, in Mahabharata on this day Bheeshma Pitamaha, chose to leave for his heavenly abode. As per the boon granted to Devavrata (young Bheeshma), he could choose his time of death so, he chose this day, when the sun starts on its course towards the northern hemisphere. According to Hindu scripture, Bhagavad Gita, those who die when the sun is on its northward course (from south to north) attain nirvana.  This explains the choice made by Devavrata to wait until Uttarayana to die.\n\nAccording to the Hindu tradition the six months of Uttarayana are a single day of the Gods; the six months of Dakshinayana are a single night of the Gods. Thus a year of twelve months is single Nychthemeron of the Gods. This refers to the six months of single day at the North pole and concurrent six months of night at the south pole.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Animated illustration of Uttarayana and Dakshinayana\n\nHindu astronomy\nHindu calendar\nArticles containing video clips", "Linda Mary Fraser (born 30 October 1953) is a New Zealand former cricketer who played as a left-arm medium bowler.

He was the youngest child of Mladen and Judita (n\u00e9e Vuki\u010devi\u0107) Petkovich. Nikola's two siblings were a sister, Ljubica, and a brother, Teodor. Their father was a successful merchant and importer. By the age of ten, Petkovich had lost both his parents: his mother before he was three, and his father before he was ten. The Petkovich estate was divided, and a trust fund was established for Nikola and the two siblings to provide for their respective education.\n\nPetkovich graduated from the Novi Sad Gymnasium and enrolled in law school at the University of Zagreb. His brother Teodor graduated from the same law school and became a prominent judge and author of several books on philosophy. Petkovich looked up to his older brother and first thought he might follow in Teodor's footsteps. After a year, he withdrew from law school and entered the prestigious Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.\n\nIn 1912 during the First Balkan War, he left school with some of his friends and voluntarily joined the Serbian Army. He was assigned to an army hospital in Old Serbia and when the war ended three months later, he was given an honorable discharge. Upon leaving the military, he went to a seminary to become a monk and was ordained a hieromonk. There he also studied icon and fresco painting. Upon completion in 1916, he decided to emigrate abroad. Petkovich, now Father Nikolaj, arrived in New York City with six dollars in his pocket, and a letter of introduction to a Serbian priest in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. For the next quarter of a century he served Serb communities in Akron and Lorain, Ohio; Butte, Montana; and Clairton and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He also took up teaching art in the 1920s at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now CMU) in Pittsburgh where he remained for the rest of his life.\n\nBy 1940, he was listed in the city directory as Rev. Nikolaj Petkovich, pastor of St. Sava's Serbian Orthodox Church and resided 2107 Sidney Street, on Pittsburgh's South Side. In 1944, he appeared in the city directory as \"Conversationalist,\" a reference to his role as Serbian language instructor for a group of U.S. soldiers being trained at the University of Pittsburgh as candidates for the Office of Strategic Services. While at St. Sava's, Father Nikolaj was separated from the Serbian Orthodox Church in 1942 when he broke his vow as a celibate priest by marrying Zora Strain. A petition was signed by parishioners asking for his reinstatement but it was all to no avail.\n\nAfter leaving the Orthodox Church, Nicholas Petkovich was invited to be an assistant minister of the Calvary Episcopal Church in Shadyside. There he served on a voluntary basis and befriended Bishop Lauriston L. Scaife, and two artists Norwood Hodge MacGilvary (1874-1949), and Andrey Avinoff. All three would change the direction of Petkovich's life. Petkovich met MacGilvary while he was a student at Carnegie Tech. As associate professor of Art, MacGilvary was impressed with the talents of Nikolaj, now Nicholas, and appointed him to the faculty as \"Messier\", so that Petkovich need pay no tuition. Later, Petkovich would meet Dr. Avinoff, an entomologist and artist who was at the time Director of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. When Petkovich accepted to be an assistant minister at Cavalry Episcopal Church, Avinoff was among the first to congratulate him. Sadly, however, Petkovich was to see both of those close friends, Avianoff and MacGilvary, pass away in 1949.\n\nA few years later, Petkovich died on 16 October 1952.\n\nWorks\nFrom December 1955 and January 1956, a memorial exhibition of his art work was held in Pittsburgh. Nicholas Petkovich's works are on display at Westmoreland Museum of American Art in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, and other collections are being sold on a regular basis.\n\nSee also\n Nick Lalich\n George Musulin\n George Vujnovich\n\nSources\n Serb World U.S.A., Vol XXVIII, No. 6, July/August 2012, pages 20\u201327\n\nReferences \n\n1893 births\n1952 deaths\nSerbian Orthodox clergy\nPeople from In\u0111ija\nAmerican people of Serbian descent\nCarnegie Mellon University faculty\n20th-century American male artists", "Sarah Jane Foster (October 12, 1839 \u2013 ) was an educator of newly-freed blacks in Martinsburg, West Virginia, one of many northern volunteers who travelled south to aid and teach freedmen following the American Civil War.\n\nEarly life \nSarah Jane Foster was born on October 12, 1839, the second of children of Moses B. Foster and Eliza A. Benson Foster.  She grew up in Gray, Maine.  Her exact level of education is unknown.  Though she was too poor to have attended much in the way of formal schooling (she longed to have enough money to purchase her own books), she was well read and had well-educated siblings, including a doctor, a nurse and author, and a clergyman.  Her family attended a Free Will Baptist church.\n\nInitially Foster worked as a domestic servant and cared for the sick and dying, then as a teacher.  She began writing for Home Monthly, a woman's magazine, and Zion's Advocate, a Baptist newspaper published in Portland, Maine.  She also wrote short stories and sentimental poetry.\n\nFoster was hired by Reverend Silas Curtis of the Free Will Baptist Home Missionary Society to teach in Martinsburg and she arrived in November 1865, documenting her work in dispatches for the Zion's Advocate.  She taught in an \"uncommonly bad\" basement classroom, lacking a blackboard and sufficient textbooks, teaching about 80 students each day and 45 each night.  Previous attempts at schooling had been met with harassment and violence, so she was publicly accompanied by male students to protect her, including her assistant John Brown (the namesake of the abolitionist hero).  This led to a different kind of harassment, alleging Foster was engaged in sexual relationships with Brown and her students, or part-black herself.  The harassment was so intense that an armed Freedmen's Bureau agent had to escort her home one evening.  Foster was only in Martinsburg for four months; in April 1866 she was transferred to Harpers Ferry and in July, while on summer leave in Maine, she was dismissed.\n\nUndeterred, Foster applied to the American Missionary Society and was hired to work with Francis L. Cardozo in Charleston, South Carolina, but she was soon sent to rural Charleston Neck, where she taught on an isolated farm away from the possible outrages of local whites.  There she contracted yellow fever and died back in Maine on June 25, 1868.\n\nLegacy \nHer great-great-nephew Wayne E.

Between 1891 and 1893 he was a student at the Leeds College of Art where he also taught clay modelling.\n\nSpruce first worked at a local tile factory before moving to Burmantofts Pottery in Leeds, where he was principal modeller. His work there includes some fine panels on the Midland Hotel, Manchester.  He went to Paris to study art and returned to Leeds to set up as a freelance artist with a studio in Chapeltown, Leeds.  In this he was successful, performing numerous portrait commissions of contemporarary figures including a bust of the Lord Mayor of Leeds, Sir James Kitson. Between 1906 and 1915 he exhibited at least four works at the Royal Academy in London. He also created the panels for the war memorial at Bailiff Bridge in West Yorkshire. Possibly Spruce's best known work is the 1918 large multi-figure memorial to the Leeds businessman Sam Wilson at Lawnswood Cemetery in Leeds. The monument is recognised by Historic England with a Grade II listing.\n\nSpruce was also a noted member of the Leeds branch of the Savage Club, becoming its \"Indian Chief\" (i.e. president) in 1912.

Still, every state has the ability to pick and chose what specific provisions of the UCC it wishes to adopt and make its own modifications. Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 governs the sale of goods that are over the price of $500 dollars. Illinois specifically has adopted the exact same Article 2 of the UCC to govern the sale of goods; This is also called the model code. The purpose of the UCC is to allow parties to freely enter into a contract for the sale of goods with their own terms, but still have default rules and gap-fillers for terms in the contract that are missing, ambiguous, or conflicting. A party may include in its contract a force majeure clause. A force majeure clause is a contract clause that allows parties to be free of liability and obligation in the event that an extraordinary capacity event beyond the parties control occurs.\n\nThere has been much debate regarding whether or not COVID-19 is considered an extraordinary capacity event that would be covered by the force majeure clause in many contracts. Many businesses are arguing that the force majeure clauses contained in its contract should be in full force and effect due to the Illinois Executive Order Regulations released during the pandemic that limited production and man-power. A recent case in Illinois discusses if COVID-19 should be considered an extraordinary capacity event under force majeure clauses. In Rudolph, the Court does not decide if COVID-19 is an even covered by a force majeure clause. It instead provides  that every case needs its own individual analysis in deciding if the force majeure clause is in full force and effect for every unique circumstance in which the parties state that they could not perform under the contract. The Court notes that in order for the force majeure to be relevant due to COVID, lack of performance by the party must have completely been out of its/their control, and that government regulation could be evidence of that. In determining what is out a parties control, it is important to take in consideration all of the things that were impacted due to COVID-19 including: supply chains, production restrictions, employee restrictions, health restrictions, etc. This is going to be an ongoing issue, and the bigger the losses are due to COVID-19, the more important the law regarding force majeure clauses becomes.\n\nReferences \n\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States\nUniform Commercial Code", "Jordan Stephen Roberts (born 5 January 1994) is an English professional footballer who plays as a striker for Stevenage.\n\nRoberts has previously played for Tamworth, Havant & Waterlooville, Bishop's Stortford, Aldershot Town, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Crawley Town, Lincoln City, Gillingham, Heart of Midlothian,  Ipswich Town and Motherwell.\n\nClub career\n\nAldershot Town\nRoberts was born in Watford, Hertfordshire.

It tells the story of a Mexican-American male who becomes a boxer, believing this kind of achievement will gain him respect among the English-speaking white majority. The film was shot in various locations in early 1950s Los Angeles. The film examines institutionalized bigotry.\n\nPlot \nThe film focuses on a young Mexican-American named Tomas Cantanios, who boxed under the pseudonym Tommy Kansas, a resident of Los Angeles's poor Chicano neighborhood. He feels constrained due to his inability to thrive in a white-dominated society. Therefore, to achieve popularity, he becomes a professional boxer, achieving fame and recognition. He soon discovers that Anglos are only drawn to him for his sports reputation and that they still consider him an outsider because of his ancestry and skin color. In fact, the only two white men who treat him decently are his manager Pete and trainer Freddy. However, their tolerant behavior is based primarily on monetary gain. Tommy also is conflicted by his unconditional love for Lucy, the daughter of a punch-drunk bum.\n\nProduction \nThe Ring is one of the early sports-centered films in Hollywood in which discrimination against Chicanos is presented.

She was built at Milford by Richard Chitty and launched in 1759. She was sold for breaking at Woolwich on 17 May 1785.\n\nConstruction\n\nIn sailing qualities Milford was broadly comparable with French frigates of equivalent size, but with a shorter and sturdier hull and greater weight in her broadside guns. She was also comparatively broad-beamed with ample space for provisions and the ship's mess, and incorporating a large magazine for powder and round shot. Taken together, these characteristics would enable Milford to remain at sea for long periods without resupply. She was also built with broad and heavy masts, which balanced the weight of her hull, improved stability in rough weather and made her capable of carrying a greater quantity of sail. The disadvantages of this comparatively heavy design were a decline in manoeuvrability and slower speed when sailing in light winds.\n\nHer designated complement was 200, comprising two commissioned officers  a captain and a lieutenant  overseeing 40 warrant and petty officers, 91 naval ratings, 38 Marines and 29 servants and other ranks. Among these other ranks were four positions reserved for widow's men  fictitious crew members whose pay was intended to be reallocated to the families of sailors who died at sea.\n\nService history\n\nFollowing Spain's declaration of war, joining the French against Great Britain in the Seven Years' War, Milford fell in with an aviso carrying orders from Spain to its forces in Havana. The ships met off Cape Tiburon, the westernmost point of St Domingo and after fighting all day the aviso was forced to strike. The avisos commander sank his despatches and the only document received in Havana was a copy of the Madrid Gazette containing the Spanish declaration of war.\n\nOn 6 June 1776, Milford captured the American privateer , a 14-gun, single-deck sloop, after a two-hour battle. The Americans had believed they were chasing a merchantman, but reversed course when they came close enough to recognize the British ship of war. Milford gave chase and caught up to the much smaller ship after about an hour, firing only bow chasers until she was able to come along and give a full broadside. Yankee Heros sails were shredded and almost half her crew incapacitated. Her commander, Captain James Tracy ordered the surrender when they were no longer able to either fight or flee. Four or five of Yankee Heros crew were killed and twelve or thirteen wounded, including the captain.\n\nMilford stands out as the British vessel that engaged the first American armed vessel, .  In the Battle of Yarmouth, under the command of Captain Joseph Olney, Cabot stood out of Boston weeks before on 23 March 1777 the vessel encountered Milford. The vastly more powerful British ship chased Cabot and forced her ashore in Nova Scotia. While Cabots captain and crew escaped into the woods unharmed, the British were later able to get the brig off, and refitted her for service in the Royal Navy.\n\nOn 15 March 1779, the British warships Apollo, , and Milford captured the French privateer cutter . The Royal Navy took her into service under her existing name.\n\nOn 2 October 1779,  captured two French cutters,  and , each of 14 guns and 120 men. The Royal Navy took both into service essentially under their existing names. Jupiter shared the prize money with Apollo, , and Milford.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links\n \n\nFrigates of the Royal Navy\n1759 ships", "Robeco Schweiz is an international investment company with a specific focus on sustainability investments.

Proponents of sustainable investing say that integrating sustainability considerations into investment decisions can lead to superior risk-adjusted returns over the long term.\n\nSAM has theme strategies based on major sustainability trends such as water, energy, materials, agribusiness, and climate. It also has core regional products such as a sustainable global active fund and a sustainable European equities fund. The SAM Sustainable Water Fund received a lot of recognition as it was one of the first of its kind to be launched in 2001. In 2011 it celebrated its 10th anniversary.\n\nClean Tech Private Equity\nSAM houses the clean tech private equity team of its parent company Robeco, a member of Orix. The concept of clean tech investing is based on a world that is characterized by rapid population growth, finite natural resources, high prices and material shortages; all of which call for more efficient production processes. Investments include products, services, and processes across industry verticals that are designed to improve the productive and responsible use of natural resources, greatly reduce or eliminate environmental damage and provide superior performance at lower costs.\n\nSAM Clean Tech Private Equity invests in sustainable private equity through co-investments in unlisted companies or through private equity fund of funds. Since 2004, they have been integrating the ESG framework into investment process. The United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment indicated that SAM Clean Tech Private Equity is a leader in integrating ESG into the investment process as well as into its ownership policies and practices. In 2010, Investment & Pensions Europe (IPE) named SAM Private Equity as the most Responsible European Private Equity Investor.\n\nThe table below demonstrates some examples of clean tech sectors and technologies:\n\nSustainability Services\nIn 2006, SAM founded a sustainability services division. Sustainability services provides company benchmarking reports that provide companies with details about their individual sustainability performance as well as a peer group comparison. Companies can see their strengths and weaknesses mapped against sustainability criterion and compared to best practice examples.\n\nSAM Research\nSAM's asset management, index and sustainability services are all rooted in its proprietary in-house research division. The financial analysts generate stock recommendations based on a combination of financial sustainability criteria.\n\nThe research team develops the methodology for the annual corporate sustainability assessment that is used to determine the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. SAM research has been analyzing companies along sustainability metrics since 1995 and has developed one of the largest global corporate sustainability databases. The research department often collaborates with academia to share the valuable data from this proprietary database. Ongoing collaborations include projects with ETH and IESE Business School.\n\nCorporate sustainability assessment\nThe family of Dow Jones Sustainability Index are based on the results of the corporate sustainability assessment. The findings are then presented in the Industry Leader Report for each of the 60 industries assessed via the Corporate Sustainability Assessment and represented in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index.\n\nMuch of the data derived from the corporate sustainability assessment is used in SAM's financial analysis. The data is integrated into the valuation models. Full integration of sustainability into valuation analysis is a differing approach to using data as a sustainability overlay. Advocates of the integration approach state that it is a more accurate reflection of the companies value as it takes into account the various ways in which sustainability factors affect different business models and cost structures.\n\nAlso from the results of the corporate sustainability assessment, SAM produces a \"Sustainability Yearbook\" After the assessment, each participating company receives a peer benchmarking analysis. in which they announce the companies that have been ranked as sustainability \"sector leaders\" and/or \"sector movers\". They also give a small number of companies a classification of gold, silver or bronze to recognize their added commitment to sustainability issues. Sector leaders in the past have included: Adidas, BMW, Nokia, Panasonic, PepsiCo, Pirelli, and Rolls-Royce Group plc. Sector movers in the past have included: Air France, Fiat, Hormel, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Starbucks.\n\nAwards\nBest Climate Change Fund, 2010: The SAM Sustainable Climate Fund was awarded the \"Best Climate Change Fund\" by Investment Week\nSRI/Sustainable Investment Manager of the Year Award, 2010: awarded by Financial News in October 2010.\nTBLI Best Asset Manager Investing in ESG, 2008, 2009: awarded by IPE TBLI Group ESG Leaders Awards\n\nMemberships\nSAM is a member of the following organizations:\nPRI, Principles for Responsible Investment\nEurosif, European Social Investment Forum\nCeres, Investors and Environmentalists for Sustainable Prosperity\nASrIA, The Association for Sustainable & Responsible Investment in Asia\n\nSustainability leadership awards\nIn 2001, SAM and Sustainable Performance Group (SPG) founded the sustainability leadership award. The award ran from 2001 to 2010 and was presented annually to a chosen sustainability leader and pioneer.\n\nSee also\n Dow Jones Sustainability Index\n Dow Jones Indexes\n World Water Index\n\nReferences\n\nInvestment companies of Switzerland\n1995 establishments in Switzerland", "Hugh de Fellenberg Montgomery (1844\u20131924) was an Ulster Unionist Party member of the Senate of Northern Ireland from 1922 until his death in 1924.\n\nHe was the son of Hugh Severin Montgomery of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire and educated at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating BA in 1868.

() is an official nonprofit organization dedicated to the aid of the homeless population in Tokyo, Japan. Sanyukai's services include a free clinic, as well as an outreach program which distributes food and clothing to the homeless in the area.\n\nStructure\nSanyukai is located in the San'ya district in Tokyo, Japan. The building has three floors, and includes the free Sanyu clinic, a kitchen where food is prepared for the Outreach Program, and an office where free legal advice is offered. Sanyukai also hosts events in an effort to bring the community together in aiding the homeless.\n\nClinic\nLocated on the first floor of the Sanyukai building, Sanyu Clinic is one of the few free clinics in Tokyo. Homeless members of society can receive consultations with professional doctors and nurses. Depending on the diagnosis, the patient may receive medical advice, free prescription medication, or a ride to the hospital for intensive care. Most of the clinic staff are medical professionals volunteering on their time off. At this point, Sanyu clinic hosts nine doctors, one chiropractor, four acupuncturists, and six nurses. Working full-time at Sanyukai is one registered nurse who is also the clinic coordinator; another nurse works part-time.\n\nOutreach program\nCentered around the kitchen on the second floor, the Outreach Program strives to provide the homeless with free meals and decent clothing. Several times a week, Sanyukai will prepare individually wrapped meals and go on patrol in the area. Concentrating on the parks and riverside areas homeless individuals frequent, these patrols provide free meals and conversation. This Program works to not only provide the homeless with daily needs, but also establish Sanyukai as a place of safety and help for them. While providing food, the patrol also takes note of everyone's health, sometimes recommending a visit to the Sanyu Clinic. The Outreach Program works to establish and maintain connections with the homeless in the area, to more effectively aid those in need.\n\nSocial center\nAnother aspect of Sanyukai is how it functions as a gathering place for the homeless in the area. Every day, a large group of people can be found in front of the building, joking and socializing. Most of the homeless people in the area are middle aged or elderly men who are out of work and have no real family. Sanyukai functions as a place where these people can relax and socialize. The volunteers provide green tea and other basic things at the Sanyukai entrance that help these people on a daily basis. The homeless are provided with toothbrushes, shaving razors, towels, hand soap, and laundry detergent, to help them maintain their hygiene and health. Once a month, a barber volunteers his services and spends a day giving as many free haircuts as he can. Overall, Sanyukai is not only a place where the homeless go when they are sick or starving, but rather, a landmark where they are welcomed and taken care of.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n  \n  \n NPO portal site \"Sanyukai\" - Cabinet Office\n\nMedical and health organizations based in Japan\nHomelessness organizations\nNon-profit organizations based in Japan", "In logic and philosophy, an argument is an attempt to persuade someone of something, or give evidence or reasons for accepting a particular conclusion.\n\nArgument may also refer to:\n\nMathematics and computer science\nArgument (complex analysis), a function which returns the polar angle of a complex number\nCommand-line argument, an item of information provided to a program when it is started\nParameter (computer programming), a piece of data provided as input to a subroutine\nArgument principle, a theorem in complex analysis \nAn argument of a function, also known as an independent variable\n\nLanguage and rhetoric\nArgument (literature), a brief summary, often in prose, of a poem or section of a poem or other work\nArgument (linguistics), a phrase  that appears in a syntactic relationship with the verb in a clause\nOral argument in the United States, a spoken presentation to a judge or appellate court by a lawyer (or parties when representing themselves) of the legal reasons why they should prevail\nClosing argument, in law, the concluding statement of each party's counsel reiterating the important arguments in a court case\n\nOther uses\nMusical argument, a concept in the theory of musical form\nArgument (ship), an Australian sloop wrecked in 1809\nDas Argument, a German academic journal\nArgument Clinic, a Monty Python sketch\nA disagreement between two or more parties or the discussion of the disagreement\nArgument (horse)\n\nSee also\nThe Argument (disambiguation)", "Engineering and Installation, better known as E&I, is a functionary of the United States Air Force that\nprovides the engineering and installation of telecommunications into permanent facilities.

He had a successful season once again, claiming 24 wickets at 31.79 and finishing behind Stuart Clark as the second leading wicket taker for New South Wales. 2002\u201303 was a season that saw Bracken struggle as he only took 16 wickets in 6 matches at a rather expensive 36.62. 2003\u201304 saw Bracken make his Test debut and as a result, he appeared less frequently for New South Wales. Despite this, he still performed well in the 4 matches he participated in, taking 16 wickets at 24.75. Following this season, Bracken was signed by Gloucestershire to play in the English first-class competition as a replacement for Mike Smith. Bracken only played 2 matches for the club, however he was quite successful and took 5 wickets at 21.20 with best figures of 2/12 coming against Lancashire.\n\n2004\u201305 was Bracken's best season for New South Wales to date. He played in all 11 matches and took 43 wickets at an average of 18.79. The season contained a number of memorable performances by Bracken including a phenomenal spell of 7/4 off 7 overs to help dismiss South Australia for a mere 29 runs at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 2 December 2004. The figures were Bracken's best ever at the time, and are amongst the most impressive figures seen in Australian domestic cricket history. He also played an enormous part in New South Wales' thrilling 1 wicket win in the final against Queensland, winning Man of the Match. Bracken claimed 6/27 in 13.2 overs to help bowl out Queensland for 102 in their first innings and took an important 2/54 in their second innings. To add to this, Bracken scored an invaluable 11* to guide his team home to their target of 183 after New South Wales were 9/161, still needing 22 for victory. 2005\u201306 saw a return to the Test team for Bracken and as a result, fewer matches for New South Wales. Bracken still performed strongly in his few games, taking 13 wickets at 17.53. After only playing 2 matches in the 2006\u201307 season, the Blues enjoyed Bracken's services in their Pura Cup winning 2007\u201308 season as he appeared in the final and took 22 wickets at 21.22 during the season.\n\nList A cricket\nBracken made his List A debut for New South Wales against the now defunct Canberra Comets on 31 October 1998 at Manuka Oval, Canberra. New South Wales won the match and Bracken was rather economical taking 0/19 off his 5 overs. After a Man of the Match performance against Queensland in the semi-final of the Mercantile Mutual Cup, Bracken was selected in the New South Wales team to meet Victoria in the final in only his 5th List A game. Bracken was economical, taking 0/28 off his 10 overs however New South Wales still lost the final by 39 runs.\n\nAfter only playing one match in the 1999\u201300 season, the 2000\u201301 season proved to be a successful one for Bracken as he made his One Day International debut and helped New South Wales to win the Mercantile Mutual Cup. Bracken took 11 wickets at an average of 25.00, including figures of 2/43 in the final against Western Australia. He continued his good form into the 2001\u201302 season, helping New South Wales claim their second consecutive One Day title, this time over Queensland. Bracken took 18 wickets at 21.88 during the season, which included his best List A performance to date, as he took 5/38 against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 2002\u201303 was another successful season for both Bracken and New South Wales, as the Blues recorded their third consecutive domestic One Day title and Bracken claimed 15 scalps at 23.66. Bracken was once again a leading performer in the final, taking 2/35 off his 10 overs as New South Wales cruised to a 7 wicket win.\n\nAfter three seasons of success, Bracken struggled for New South Wales in both the 2003\u201304 and 2004\u201305 seasons taking 3 wickets at 76.33 and 7 wickets at 44.71 respectively. International commitments left Bracken out of the side for a large majority of the 2005\u201306 One Day season, however he performed well in his limited appearances, claiming 5 wickets at 21.60. Once again, Bracken's international duties kept him out of a large majority of the 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308 seasons and he took 3 wickets at 54.33 and 5 wickets at 37.80 respectively.\n\nInternational career\n\nTest cricket\n\nBracken made his Test debut for Australia on 4 December 2003 against India in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy as a replacement for the injured Glenn McGrath. In a drawn Test, Bracken had a respectable debut Test claiming 1/90 off 26 overs in the first innings and 2/12 off 4 overs in the second. Despite this, Bracken was dropped for Western Australian paceman Brad Williams for the Second Test at Adelaide. The selectors chose Bracken ahead of Andrew Bichel for the final two Tests and in a drawn series that saw most bowlers struggle, he finished with 6 wickets at 58.50.\n\nDue to the strength of fast bowling in Australia, Bracken was kept out of the Test team for nearly 2 years until he was selected in the Australian side for the 1st Test of the 2005\u201306 Frank Worrell Trophy against the West Indies in Brisbane. It was in this match that Bracken recorded both his best Test batting and bowling performances to date. In Australia's first innings he struck 37 off 51 balls and in the West Indians' second innings, Bracken claimed figures of 4/48 off 16 overs including the wickets of Brian Lara and Shivnarine Chanderpaul. Despite this good all-round performance, leg spinner Stuart MacGill was favoured by the selectors for the remaining Tests in the series. In December 2005, Bracken played the 1st Test against South Africa at the WACA Ground before once again being dropped in favour of Stuart MacGill.\n\nBracken has not played another Test since then due to the rise of Stuart Clark and Mitchell Johnson however in February 2008 he claimed that he was still eager to claim a spot in the Test team. Bracken is considered unlucky by many for his lack of Test starts given his one-day form \u2013 leading to comparisons with Michael Bevan.\n\nOne Day cricket \nBracken made his debut for Australia on 11 January 2001 against the West Indies. Although putting in respectable performances with the ball, he could not manage an assured place in the side due to both injuries and the strength of the Australian team. However, after Jason Gillespie was dropped from the national side, Bracken returned for the 2005 ICC Super Series against the World XI. This began the start of a sustained run in the national team and rise of Bracken as an international cricketer.\n\nIn the record-breaking fifth ODI during Australia's Tour of South Africa in 2006, Bracken achieved his maiden 5 wicket haul, taking 5-67 off 10 overs. He was the only bowler in the match to concede less than 7 runs an over. From the third ODI of that tour until the 5th match of the Commonwealth Bank series in 2007, Bracken went on a 17 match streak of taking at least a wicket a game. His consistency was rewarded with a place in the 2007 World Cup winning team and took 16 wickets during the campaign.\n\nOn 8 February 2008, Bracken achieved his best ever international figures taking 5\u201347 against Sri Lanka in Sydney. On 8 July Bracken displaced Daniel Vettori as the no. 1 ranked ODI bowler in the world following the series against the West Indies. He was also named in the ICC World ODI team of the year in 2008 and awarded Australia's ODI player of the year at the 2009 Allan Border Medal ceremony. Bracken played his last ODI on 17 September 2009 after succumbing to a knee injury and being ruled out of the 2009 ICC Champions Trophy. This would be his last appearance in Australian colours as the selectors moved on towards younger players. Bracken later announced he would quit from all forms of international cricket on 29 January 2011.\n\nHe finished with 174 ODI wickets at an average of 24.36 and proved to be a vital member of the Australian One Day International side during his career. With a combination of accuracy, swing and cutters, Bracken established himself as one of the most effective limited overs bowlers in the world.\n\nCareer highlights\n\nTests \nTest Debut: vs India at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, 4 December 2003 (cap 387).\n\n Bracken's 1st Test wicket was that of Virender Sehwag, caught by Matthew Hayden (1st match).\n Bracken's best bowling figures of 4/48 off 16 overs came against the West Indies at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, 6 November 2005\n Bracken's highest score of 37 came against the West Indies at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, 4 November 2005\n\nOne Day Internationals\nOne Day International Debut: vs West Indies at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, 11 January 2001 (cap 142).\n\n Bracken's 1st One Day International wicket was that of Sherwin Campbell, caught by Michael Bevan (1st match).\n Bracken's 50th One Day International wicket was that of Sanath Jayasuriya, caught by Andrew Symonds (31st match).\n Bracken's 100th One Day International wicket was that of Makhaya Ntini, bowled (60th match).\n Bracken's best bowling figures of 5/47 off 8.3 overs came against Sri Lanka at the Sydney Cricket Ground, 8 February 2008\n Bracken's highest score of 21* off 12 balls came against New Zealand at Jade Stadium, 10 December 2005\n Took figures of 3/22 against the West Indies in the final of the 2006 ICC Champions Trophy\n He was part of Australia's Cricket World Cup winning squads in both 2003 and 2007.\n\nTwenty20 Internationals\nTwenty20 International Debut: vs South Africa at the Brisbane Cricket Ground, 9 January 2006 (cap 14).\n\n Bracken's 1st Twenty20 International wicket was that of Boeta Dippenaar, caught by Brad Haddin (1st match).\n Bracken's best bowling figures of 3/11 off 2.3 overs came against India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, 1 February 2008\n Bracken's highest score of 4 off 3 balls came against Zimbabwe at Newlands Cricket Ground, 12 September 2007\n\nAwards\n Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year \u2013 2001.\n Bracken has won three One Day International and one Twenty20 International Man of the Match awards.\n Man of the Series in the 2007\u201308 Commonwealth Bank Series.\n\nAchievements and records\n Bracken finished as Australia's leading wicket taker in One Day International cricket for the year 2006 with 46 wickets at an average of 18.82.\n Bracken reached 100 One Day International wickets in his 60th match.

The ranch provided goods for trade and was a place where the caravans that plied the road would stop on their journey coming from or going to Santa Fe.  It was a paraje, an official rest stop for travelers, and was even mentioned by the great colonial military leader and governor, Don Juan Bautista de Anza, when he stopped here with his expeditionary force in 1780.\n\nEl Rancho de las Golondrinas, located on 200 acres in the rural farming valley of La Ci\u00e9nega just south of Santa Fe, New Mexico, strives to maintain examples of life during the period when Spain ruled in the southwestern portion of the North and most of the Central American continent. The museum opened in 1972 and is dedicated to the history, heritage and culture of 18th and 19th century New Mexico. Guides are dressed in period clothing and demonstrate weaving, hide tanning, milling, blacksmithing and the planting of crops. In addition to normal hours of operation there are ten annual festivals at El Rancho de las Golondrinas. The ranch and its acequia system (irrigation ditch complex) are listed on the National Register of Historic Places[1] and the New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties.\n\nHistory\nIn 1932, Leonora Frances Curtin (later Paloheimo) and her mother purchased the ranch property.  Leonora is known for the founding of Santa Fe's Native Market in an effort to save and reestablish traditional craft forms and techniques, and to provide local artisans with a source of income during the Great Depression. After their marriage in 1946, Leonora and her Finnish husband, Yrj\u00f6 Alfred (Y.A.) Paloheimo, saw the potential in the old ranch as a site for a living history museum.  Both Leonora and Y.A. devoted themselves to transforming the property into a place where visitors could physically engage with the rich culture of the region and become immersed in the history of New Mexico. Existing historic buildings were restored, period structures were erected and historic buildings were brought in from other sites around New Mexico.  The museum officially opened its doors in the spring of 1972 and over time has grown into New Mexico's premier living history museum.  Today the museum promotes and preserves the Hispano heritage of Northern New Mexico, while at the same time building a better understanding of the lasting influence of Hispanos in the Southwest and the rest of the country.\n\nFilmography\n\nEl Rancho de las Golondrinas has been seen in numerous Western films. Some movies filmed here include Butch and Sundance: The Early Days (1979), Wild Times (1980) the CBS miniseries Comanche Moon (2008), and the Better Call Saul episodes \"The Guy for This\" and \"Dedicado a Max\".\n\nSee also\n\nNational Register of Historic Places listings in Santa Fe County, New Mexico\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nMuseums in Santa Fe, New Mexico\nHistoric American Engineering Record in New Mexico\nHistory museums in New Mexico\nLiving museums in New Mexico\nRanches on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico\nVillages in New Mexico\nColonial New Mexico\nSpanish-American culture in New Mexico\nNorthern Rio Grande National Heritage Area\nNational Register of Historic Places in Santa Fe County, New Mexico\nCamino Real de Tierra Adentro", "The 2014  Tour Cycliste F\u00e9minin International de l'Ard\u00e8che was a women's cycle stage race held in France  from 2 September to 7 September, 2014.

It also serves as the administrative center of Tarnogsky Selsoviet, one of the thirteen selsoviets into which the district is administratively divided. Municipally, it is the administrative center of Tarnogskoye Rural Settlement. Population:\n\nHistory\n\nTarnogsky Gorodok has been first mentioned in the chronicles in 1453. The area produced crops, and the Kokshenga and the Vaga were used to transport bread to Arkhangelsk. In the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great the area was included into Vazhsky Uyezd of Archangelgorod Governorate. In 1796, the area became part of Totemsky Volost in the center in the town of Totma. In 1890s, Tarnogsky Gorodok became the center of Shevdenitskaya Volost.\n\nOn July 15,\u00a01929, Kokshengsky District with the administrative center in the selo of Tarnogsky Gorodok was established as part of Vologda Okrug of Northern Krai. It included parts of the former area of Totemsky Uyezd. July\u00a030, 1931 Kokshengsky District and the neighboring Sukhonsky District were abolished, and Nyuksensky District with the center in the selo of Nyuksenitsa was established. January\u00a025, 1935 Tarnogsky District with the administrative center in Tarnogsky Gorodok was established from some areas formerly in Nyuksensky and Totemsky Districts.\n\nEconomy\n\nIndustry\nThe economy of the Tarnogsky Gorodok is based on timber industry. Food industry is also present, in particular, there is a butter factory.\n\nTransportation\nTarnogsky Gorodok is on the paved road connecting Oktyabrsky in Arkhangelsk Oblast in the north with Totma in the south and Veliky Ustyug in the east. There also local roads. There is regular passenger bus service originating from Tarnogsky Gorodok.\n\nTarnogsky Gorodok was served by the Tarnogsky Gorodok Airport, which is currently defunct.\n\nCulture and recreation\nTarnogsky Gorodok hosts the Museum of Traditional Folk Culture. The ethnographic department of the museum is located in the selo of Zarechye.\n\nThe regional newspaper, Kokshenga, is published in Tarnogsky Gorodok.\n\nReferences\n\nNotes\n\nSources\n\nRural localities in Tarnogsky District\nTotemsky Uyezd", "The Sukhoi Su-34 (; NATO reporting name: Fullback) is a Soviet-origin Russian twin-engine, twin-seat, all-weather supersonic medium-range fighter-bomber/strike aircraft. It first flew in 1990, intended for the Soviet Air Forces, and it entered service in 2014 with the Russian Air Force.\n\nBased on the Sukhoi Su-27 Flanker air superiority fighter, the Su-34 has an armoured cockpit with side-by-side seating for its two pilots. The Su-34 is designed primarily for tactical deployment against ground and naval targets (tactical bombing/attack/interdiction roles, including against small and mobile targets) on solo and group missions in daytime and at night, under favourable and adverse weather conditions and in a hostile environment with counter-fire and electronic warfare (EW) counter-measures deployed, as well as for aerial reconnaissance. The Su-34 is planned to eventually replace the Su-24 tactical strike fighter and the Tu-22M long-distance bomber.\n\nDevelopment\nThe Su-34 had a murky and protracted beginning. In the mid-1980s, Sukhoi began developing a new tactical multirole combat aircraft to replace the swing-wing Su-24, which would incorporate a host of conflicting requirements. The bureau thus selected the Su-27, which excelled in maneuverability and range, and could carry a large payload, as the basis for the new fighter-bomber. More specifically, the aircraft was developed from , the naval trainer derivative of the Sukhoi Su-27K. The development, known internally as T-10V, was shelved at the end of the 1980s sharing the fate of the aircraft carrier Ulyanovsk; this was the result of the political upheaval in the Soviet Union and its subsequent disintegration.\n\nIn August 1990, a photograph taken by a TASS officer showed an aircraft making a dummy approach towards the aircraft carrier Tbilisi. The aircraft, subsequently and erroneously labelled Su-27KU by Western intelligence, made its maiden flight on 13 April 1990 with Anatoliy Ivanov at the controls. Converted from an Su-27UB with the new distinctive nose, while retaining the main undercarriage of previous Su-27s, it was a prototype for the Su-27IB (IB stands for istrebitel-bombardirovshchik, or \"fighter bomber\"). It was developed in parallel with the two-seat naval trainer, the Su-27KUB.  However, contrary to earlier reports, the two aircraft are not directly related. Flight tests continued throughout 1990 and into 1991.\n\nIn 1992, the Su-27IB was displayed to the public at the MosAeroshow (later renamed \"MAKS Airshow\"), where it demonstrated aerial refuelling with an Il-78, and performed an aerobatic display. The aircraft was officially unveiled on 13 February 1992 at Machulishi, where Russian President Boris Yeltsin and the CIS leaders were holding a summit. The following year the Su-27IB was again displayed at the MAKS Airshow.\n\nThe next prototype, and first pre-production aircraft, T10V-2, first flew on 18 December 1993, with Igor Votintsev and Yevgeniy Revoonov at the controls. Built at Novosibirsk, where Su-24s were constructed, this aircraft was visibly different from the original prototype; it had modified vertical stabilizers, twin tandem main undercarriage and a longer \"stinger\", which houses an N012 rearward-facing warning radar, plus the drogue chute and as well as fuel jettison outlet.\n\nThe first aircraft built to production standard made its maiden flight on 28 December 1994. It was fitted with a fire-control system, at the heart of which was the Leninets OKB-designed V004 passive electronically scanned array radar. It was different enough from the earlier versions that it was re-designated the \"Su-34\". However, at the 1995 Paris Air Show, the aircraft was allocated the \"Su-32FN\" designation, signalling the aircraft's potential role as a shore-based naval aircraft for the Russian Naval Aviation. Sukhoi also promoted the Su-34 as the \"Su-32MF\" (MnogoFunksionalniy, \"multi-function\").\n\nBudget restrictions caused the programme to stall repeatedly. Nevertheless, flight testing continued, albeit at a slow pace. The third pre-production aircraft first flew in late 1996.\n\nRussia's Ministry of Defence plans to modernize the Su-34; according to the deputy head of the military department, Yuriy Borisov, \"We are planning to modernize the aircraft: prolong its service life, increase the number of airborne weapons. Plane is in great demand in our armed forces, and it has a great future.\"\n\nRussia is developing two new versions of the aircraft: one for electronic warfare (L700 Tarantul ECM pod can provide electronic cover for a group of aircraft) and one for Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.\n\nSu-34M modernised version will feature a new electro-optical infrared targeting pod, a Kopyo-DL rearward facing radar that can warn the pilots if missiles are approaching, combined with automatic deployment of countermeasures and jamming.\n\nOrders and deliveries \nAn initial batch of eight aircraft was completed by the Novosibirsk factory in 2004. In March 2006, Russian Minister of Defence Sergei Ivanov announced the purchase of the first five pre-production Su-34s for the Russian Air Force. In late 2008, a second contract was signed for delivery of 32 aircraft by 2015. A total of 70 aircraft were to be purchased by 2015 to replace some 300 Su-24s in service at the time, which were then undergoing a modernization program. Ivanov claimed that as it is \"many times more effective on all critical parameters\", fewer of these newer bombers are required than the old Su-24 it replaces. In December 2006, Ivanov stated that approximately 200 Su-34s were expected to be in service by 2020. This was confirmed by Air Force chief Vladimir Mikhaylov on 6 March 2007. Two Su-34s were delivered in 2006\u20132007, and three more were delivered by the end of 2009.\n\nOn 9 January 2008, Sukhoi reported that the Su-34 had begun full-rate production. The final stage of the state tests were completed on 19 September 2011.\n\nThe Russian Air Force received another four Su-34s on 28 December 2010, as combat units in airbases first received six Su-34s in 2011. Delivery came in the form of two contracts, the first in 2008 for 32 aircraft and the second in 2012 for a further 92 aircraft, totaling 124 to be delivered by 2020.\n\nIn December 2012, Sukhoi reportedly delivered five aircraft under the 2012 State Defence Order.\n\nOn 6 May 2013, the first Su-34s under the 2013 defence procurement plan were delivered. On 9 July 2013, three more Su-34s were delivered in an official acceptance ceremony held at the Novosibirsk Aircraft Plant. By the end of 2013, Sukhoi completed the 2008 contract and started deliveries of aircraft under the 2012 contract.\n\nIn August 2013, Sukhoi ordered 184 Identification friend or foe transponders for the Russian Su-34s from the Kazan-based Radiopribor holding company, to be delivered by 2020.\n\nOn 10 June 2014, a further delivery of Su-34s was made to the 559th Bomber Aviation Regiment at Morozovsk Air Base. Another three aircraft were delivered on 18 July 2014. In total, 18 aircraft were delivered in 2014, with 20 planned to be delivered in 2015.\n\nSukhoi delivered the first batch of Su-34s under the 2015 defence procurement plan on 21 May 2015. On 16 July 2015, the Sukhoi Company handed over another batch of Su-34 frontline bombers to the Russian Defence Ministry. The transfer took place in the framework of the Unified Military Hardware Acceptance Day in the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association Plant.\n\nAfter eight years of negotiations, Rosoboronexport received official request to supply the Su-34 to the Algerian Air Force.\n\nThe last two Su-34s of the 2012 contract were delivered to the 968th Fighter Aviation Regiment at the Lipetsk Air Base in December 2020. This brought the total number of operational aircraft delivered to the Russian Air Force to 131 (not counting crashes and aircraft written off). Apart from this, also seven pre-production units were built under previous contracts.\n\nOn 25 August 2020, the Russian Defence Ministry signed a third contract for a further 24 Su-34 aircraft for the Russian Air Force. The deliveries will stretch over three years. By December 2021, the Russian Air Force received six new aircraft of the third order.\n\nIn June 2022, the Russian Air Force received another four aircraft of the third order. These were the first aircraft built under the new \"Su-34M\" standard. They became part of the 277th Bomber Aviation Regiment.\n\nIn August 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defence signed a new contract for supply of Su-34 bombers.\n\nIn November 2022, Russia received a new batch of Sukhoi Su-34s of the modernized Su-34M variant; the number is yet unknown but it is safe to assume it was at least four units. Another batch of modernized Su-34Ms was handed over to the Russian Air Force in late December 2022. At this point, the total number of Su-34s produced under all contracts, including seven prototypes and pre-production units, reached at least 153 units.\n\nDesign\n\nThe Su-34 shares most of its wing structure, tail, and engine nacelles with the Su-27/Su-30, with canards like the Su-30MKI, Su-33, and Su-27M/35 to increase static instability (higher manoeuvrability) and to reduce trim drag.\n\nThe Su-34 is powered by a pair of Saturn AL-31FM1 turbofan engines, the same engines used on the Su-27SM, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of Mach 1.8+ when fully loaded. Although slower than the standard Su-27, the Su-34 can still handle high G-loads and perform aerobatic maneuvers. When equipped with a full weapons load, the Su-34 has a maximum range of , or further with aerial refueling. The airframe is cleared to perform maneuvers of up to +9 g. The noise level of the Su-34 is two times lower than the level of its predecessors.\n\nThe Su-34 is a three lifting surface design having both a conventional horizontal tailplane at the rear and a canard foreplane in front of the main wings. The foreplane provides both additional lift (force) and greater maneuverability. It has twin tail fins like those of Su-27 from which it is derived. The Su-34 has 12 hardpoints for  of ordnance, intended to include the latest Russian precision-guided weapons. It retains the 30\u00a0mm GSh-30-1 cannon of the Su-27 and Su-30, and the ability to carry six R-77 or R-73 air-to-air missiles, with these being primarily for defense against pursuers if detected by the rearward facing radar. The maximum weight of any single munition carried is . Its stand-off weapons have a range of up to . A Khibiny electronic countermeasures (ECM) system is fitted as standard.\n\nCompared to other members of the Flanker family, the Su-34 has an entirely new \"Duckbill\" nose and forward fuselage designed to increase cabin room and maximize crew comfort and safety, giving the Su-34 the nickname \u2018Hellduck\u2019 or \u2018Platypus\u2019. The two pilots sit side-by-side in NPP Zvezda K-36dm ejection seats: the pilot-commander on the left with the navigator and weapon operator on the right. An advantage of the side by side cockpit is that duplicate instruments are not required for each pilot. Since long missions require comfort, the pressurization system allows operation up to  without oxygen masks, which are available for emergencies and combat situations.\n\nThe crew members have room to stand and move about the cabin during long missions. The space between the seats allows them to lie down, if necessary. A hand-held urinal \"toilet\" and vacuum flask \"kitchen\" are provided. A ladder attached to the nose landing gear and a hatch in the cockpit floor is used to enter the cockpit. The cockpit is a continuous capsule of armour (17\u00a0mm).\n\nThe multifunctional Leninets V-004 main radar has terrain-following and terrain avoidance modes. Maximum detection range for the passive electronically scanned array forward radar is  against large surface targets, to cover the rear a second aft-facing radar is mounted. The main radar can simultaneously track ten air targets and attack four targets (in the air, on land or on the water). The radius of detection for fighter-sized targets is up to 120\u00a0km, the range of the survey is +/- 60 degrees. The rear warning radar system can warn of attack from behind and allow it to fire its R-73 missiles against pursuers without needing to turn the aircraft. The rear radar is from Phazotron/Rassvet, and is unofficially called the N-012. The Su-34 reportedly has a frontal radar cross-section that is an order of magnitude smaller than prior generation fighters.\n\nA new 4th generation radar Pika-M of the complex BKR-3, having a range up to 300\u00a0km, passed state tests in 2016. As of 2021, several aircraft of the RuAF have passed modernization with special equipment that increases capabilities in detecting air and ground targets and expand the types of weapons used.\n\nOperational history\n\nRussia\n\nThe Su-34 is rumoured to have made its combat debut during the 2008 Russo-Georgian War.\n\nIn July 2010, several Su-34s and Su-24Ms conducted a  non-stop flight from air bases in European Russia to the Russian Far East. The exercise included aircraft carrying weapons at full load and simulated delivering them on targets, demonstrating the Su-34's long-range capability. The Su-24Ms were refuelled three times, while the Su-34s were refuelled twice.\n\nThe final stage of the Su-34's state trials was completed on 19 September 2011 and the aircraft entered service in early 2014. Russia plans to have 124 aircraft in use by 2020. It is planned to increase to 200 aircraft later.\n\nOn 4 June 2015, an Su-34 slid off the runway and flipped over when its parachute failed to open after landing. Nobody was injured. The aircraft was returning from a routine training mission in Russia's Voronezh region. In June 2016, the damaged aircraft was transferred on board an Antonov An-124 to the Novosibirsk Aircraft Production Association plant for repairs, and was likely returned to service the same year.\n\nOn 18 January 2019, two Su-34s collided mid-air in Russia's Far East region, while performing a scheduled training flight. Two pilots were killed, one was rescued and one remained missing. All Su-34 flights were suspended throughout Russia following the accident.\n\nOn 6 September 2019, two Su-34s again collided mid-air, this time in the western Russian city of Lipetsk. According to a Russian source the collision happened due to pilot error. Both pilots managed to land after the accident.\n\nOn 21 October 2020, an Su-34 crashed performing a training flight in Khabarovsk region.\n\nOn 17 October 2022, an Su-34 crashed into the courtyard of a residential apartment complex in Yeysk during a training flight, setting two blocks on fire. At least 13 people were killed and 19 were treated in hospital. Locals were seen rescuing one of the pilots and a school was evacuated. Russian defense ministry sources stated the cause of the crash was an engine fire on take off and that both pilots ejected safely.  Russian naval aviation uses Yeysk as a main training area.\n\n2015 Russian military intervention in Syria\n\nIn September 2015, six Su-34s arrived at Latakia airport in Syria, for attacks against rebel and ISIL forces. Russian air attacks in Syria started on 30 September, in the Homs region. On 1 October, the Su-34 was used to bomb Islamic State targets in Syria. The Russian Air Force Su-34 fighter-bombers destroyed an Islamic State command center and training camp south-west of the city of Raqqa. These included precision strikes from an altitude of over 5,000\u00a0m (16,400\u00a0ft).\n\nRussian Su-34 and Su-25 attack aircraft carried out air strikes the next day against Islamic State targets in Syria's Hama province using precision bombs. According to Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, Su-34s hit an ISIL fortified bunker in the Hama province with guided bombs. Fortifications, ammunition depots, seven units of the military equipment near Syria's Maarrat al-Numan were also destroyed by the Russian Air Force. An ISIL command center and underground depot were also destroyed with explosives near Raqqa. \n\nDefense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said in a statement on 3 October: \"Accurate delivery of a concrete-piercing bomb BETAB-500 launched from a Su-34 aircraft near Raqqa destroyed a hardened command centre of one of the illegal armed groups as well as an underground bunker with explosives and ammunition depot.\" A Russian Air Force representative stated Su-34s acquire targets using the GLONASS satellite system for bombing. During this time six Su-34s were in Syria.\n\nFollowing the downing of a Su-24 by Turkey, Russia announced on 30 November 2015 that Su-34s in Syria had begun flying combat missions while armed with air-to-air missiles. On 16 August 2016, Tu-22M3 long-range bombers and Su-34 bombers, having taken off from their base in Hamadan Islamic Republic of Iran, carried out group airstrikes against targets belonging to ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra terrorist groups in the provinces of Aleppo, Deir ez-Zor and Idlib.\n\nOn 3 October 2017, Russian Su-34s and Su-35s were deployed to strike \"the place of the Al-Nusra leadership meeting\" whose location was discovered by Russian military intelligence in Syria subsequently eliminating 12 Al-Nusra field commanders and some 50 militants of the group including Ahmad al-Ghizai, Al-Nusra's security chief according to the Russian Defense Ministry.\n\nOn 28 May 2018, it was reported that Russian Su-34s intercepted two Israeli Air Force F-16s over Tripoli, Lebanon, forcing them to retreat.\n\nOn 27 February 2020, two Russian Su-34s allegedly carried out an airstrike on a Turkish military convoy killing up to 36 soldiers and injuring at least 60 more in Balyun, Syria.\n\nOn 6 October 2020, two Russian Su-34s conducted air strikes against underground structures in the Eastern bank of Euphrates, Deir Ez-Zor province allegedly inside Rojava territory resulting in the death of ISIL field commander Abu Qatada, who was involved in preparing a terrorist attack against Russian forces which resulted in the death of Major General Vyacheslav Gladkikh. Additionally, the strike also destroyed two underground shelters and killed some 30 militants.\n\n2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nOn 28 February 2022, footage emerged reportedly showing Su-34s overflying the Kharkiv region of Ukraine. In various regions of Ukraine, downed Su-34 aircraft were mostly shot down by Ukrainian forces but some crashed for other reasons. One Su-34 was in a flat spin before it crashed. Another was a modernized variant Su-34M and was reportedly shot down by Russian forces. There were reports of pilots ejecting with some dying and some captured. Most of the downed planes were identified by their red tail numbers and registration numbers, for example, Red 31 with RF-81251.\n\nAs of 8 March 2023 there have been 19 visually confirmed cases of Su-34s being  lost, damaged or abandoned by Russian forces since the start of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. \n\nA lack of guided bombs required the Su-34s to fly low for accurate bombing, where they were subjected to heavy Ukrainian air-defenses. \n\nThe first Su-34 shot down during combat occurred a few days after the beginning of the war on 28 February 2022, near Buzova airfield. Other Su-34 aircraft crashes occurred early March, 5 March, and another the same day, 6 March, 14 March, 25 April, 26 April, 18 July, 11 September, 24 September and 17 October. Russia confirmed the loss of more than 10 Su-34s. It was reported on 3 March 2023 that a Su-34 was shot down over Yenakijeve, Donetsk Oblast.\n\nOther usage\nSukhoi Su-34s were used on bombing runs against ice dams on the rivers in Vologda Oblast to prevent the floods during the spring of 2016.\n\nAlgeria\nIn January 2016, Algeria was negotiating a purchase of 12 aircraft for its Air Force. The deal should have been signed in late 2016, but in 2017 the talks were still ongoing and no sale was made. On 27 December 2019, Algeria reportedly signed a contract for 14 aircraft as part of large military deal that also includes purchase of Su-35 and Su-57 fighters. However, neither Russian nor Algerian governments ever confirmed that such deal exists.\n\nAccording to Mil.press, after eight years of fruitless negotiations with Algeria on selling Su-32 (export version), in 2019 Russia agreed to sell the modernized, non-downgraded Su-34ME version; Algeria became interested in the model after the campaign in Syria, where the aircraft demonstrated excellent combat qualities. Production of the first batch was underway as of March 2021 and, according to CAWAT, should be ready in 2021. Training of Algerian pilots would commence in 2022, and all planes would be delivered by 2023.\n\nVariants\n Su-34 \u2013 basic aircraft model.\n Su-32 \u2013 export model, offered to Algeria in 2012.\n Su-34M / Su-34 NVO \u2013 modernized version. Russian contract was to be signed in 2021 and replace basic Su-34 in production. According to reports, this upgrade will seriously affect almost all of the aircraft's avionics. The radar, sight, and communication systems will be improved. The range of guided munitions that the bomber can use will be significantly expanded. EW capabilities will also be expanded with introduction of new hardpoints.\n\nOperators\n \n Russian Air Force \u2013 7 prototypes and 146 operational aircraft as of December 2022.\n 47th Bomber Aviation Regiment \u2013 Baltimor Air Base, Voronezh Oblast\n 277th Bomber Aviation Regiment \u2013 Khurba Air Base, Khabarovsk Krai\n 559th Bomber Aviation Regiment \u2013 Morozovsk Air Base, Rostov Oblast\n 2nd Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment \u2013 Chelyabinsk Shagol Airport, Chelyabinsk Oblast\n 4th Centre for Combat Employment and Retraining of Personnel \u2013 Lipetsk Air Base, Lipetsk Oblast\n State Flight Testing Center named after V.P.

He was a sports car driver from Porsche, but was seconded to Audi for selected events in 2009 and 2010. He is the ninth and most recent driver to complete the informal triple crown of endurance racing. On 29 June 2018, he became the first person in 35 years to break the all-time N\u00fcrburgring Nordschleife lap record, set by Stefan Bellof in 1983 with a Porsche 956, in a derestricted Porsche 919 Evo with a time of 5:19.546.\n\nEarly career\nBernhard was born in Homburg, Saarland. He debuted in karting in 1991. He finished 5th at the CIK/FIA Junior World Championship and was crowned German junior champion. The next two years, Bernhard was 6th and 3rd at the German Karting Championship. In 1998 he moved to formula cars as he joined Formula Ford, finishing 6th in both the German series and the Eurocup in 1998. In his last year in open-wheelers, 1999, Bernhard finished 3rd in the German Formula Ford.\n\nSports cars\nFor 2000, Bernhard drove in Porsche Supercup as a UPS Porsche Junior driver, finishing 3rd in the championship.  In 2001, he made his American Le Mans Series debut at the 12 Hours of Sebring, where he finished 2nd in the GT class with Randy Pobst and Christian Menzel, driving for Alex Job Racing.  He also made four other ALMS starts, and won the Porsche Carrera Cup championship.\n\n2002\nIn 2002 he began the season with a class win in the 24 Hours of Daytona for The Racer's Group.  He then finished second overall at the 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring driving for Alzen Motorsport.  The crowning achievement of the year was winning the GT class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, with Kevin Buckler and Lucas Luhr.  He also finished 3rd in the Carrera Cup, and won his first ALMS race (with J\u00f6rg Bergmeister) and finished 4th in the championship.\n\n2003\nBernhard began the season by winning the 24 Hours of Daytona outright in a Porsche 911 GT3-RS, driving with Buckler, Michael Schrom, and Bergmeister.  Bernhard and Bergmeister won 3 ALMS races, including Petit Le Mans, and finished second in the championship.  He also finished 3rd at the N\u00fcrburgring 24 Hours.\n\n2004\nIn 2004, Bernhard again partnered with J\u00f6rg Bergmeister in the ALMS.  The duo took six wins from nine starts and won the GT class driver's championship.  Their successes included class wins at Sebring and Petit Le Mans, both time joined by Sascha Maassen.  Bernhard also finished 4th overall and 2nd in class in the Spa 24 Hours.  He finished on the podium at the N\u00fcrburgring 24 Hours for the 3rd straight year, finishing in third in a Manthey Racing Porsche.\n\n2005\nBernhard joined Romain Dumas in the ALMS for 2005.  They scored four class wins, and Bernhard won four poles, but finished second in the championship.  Dumas also finished 2nd in the GT2 class at the 24 Hours of Le Mans, driving with J\u00f6rg Bergmeister and Patrick Long.\n\n2006\nIn 2006, Bernhard moved to Penske Racing who owned and captained by legendary owner Roger Penske and the new Porsche RS Spyder in the LMP2 class of the ALMS, again partnering Dumas.  After a frustrating start to the season, Bernhard and Dumas took advantage of the Audi R10's absence from the series to take the overall win at Mid-Ohio. This was the first overall win for an LMP2 class car, and the first win for an under-class car since 2003. Bernhard also won the LMP2 class at Petit Le Mans (with Sascha Maassen and Emmanuel Collard), and took four class victories in total and finished 3rd in the championship. He also won the 24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring outright, partnering Lucas Luhr, Marcel Tiemann, and Mike Rockenfeller.\n\n2009\nBernhard and Dumas moved to Joest Racing, in which he ran the new Audi R15 TDI.

At the time, most Christian nations heavily incorporated Biblical scripture into their laws, and as such it was illegal for any person to charge interest on a loan of money.\n\nThe name comes from the workings of the device: a rich person would deposit a large sum with a bank. His name would be kept a secret (at the banker's \"discretion\"), as a discretionary deposit was seen as an obvious dodge around the charging of usury, and it would have embarrassed the Pope, cardinals, and various nobles and merchants who made use of this device. Every year, in gratitude for the personage's deposit, the banker would make the account a \"gift\", the exact amount of which would be at the banker's discretion. Of course, the gifts would work out to whatever the prevailing rate was, 8-12%, perhaps. Should a banker's \"gifts\" be too little, depositors would eventually take their money to another bank whose \"gifts\" were more commensurate with the going rate.  Discretionary deposit accounts were not demand deposit accounts, and so notification of withdrawals often had to be given in advance \u2014 sometimes as much as a year.\n\nSee also\n Contractum trinius\n\nReferences\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n Medici money: banking, metaphysics, and art in fifteenth-century Florence, Tim Parks. 2005, W.

He also held the position of state secretary on the issues of security (Staatssekret\u00e4r f\u00fcr das Sicherheitswesen) in the General Government, and was involved in the operations of Chelmno extermination camp and Warsaw concentration camp as well as operations against the Polish resistance. He organized the execution of more than 30,000 Polish patients suffering from tuberculosis, and ordered that all male relatives of identified resistance fighters should be executed, and the rest of their family sent to Nazi concentration camps.\n\nThe Polish Secret State ordered his death. An attempted assassination resulted in his being wounded by the Kedyw unit \u2013 Battatlion Parasol in \"Operation Koppe\" (\"Akcja Koppe\") part of \"Operation Heads\" on 11 July 1944 in Krak\u00f3w. With the Eastern Front approaching Poland, Koppe ordered all prisoners to be executed rather than freed by the Soviets.\n\nIn 1945 Koppe went underground and assumed an alias (Lohmann, his wife's surname) and became a director of a chocolate factory in Bonn, Germany. In 1960 he was arrested but released on bail on 19 April 1962. His trial opened in 1964 in Bonn. He was accused of being an accessory to the mass murder of 145,000 people. The trial was adjourned due to Koppe's purported ill health and in 1966 the Bonn court decided not to prosecute and Koppe was released for medical reasons. The German government refused a Polish request for extradition. Koppe died in 1975, aged 79, in Bonn.\n\nSee also\nHolocaust in Poland\nList SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n Arendt, Hannah (1992).

This would enable the creation of integrated circuits composed solely of memristors, which, according to the patent, might be easier and less expensive to create. HP Labs stated that memristors could someday replace transistors in the same way that transistors replaced vacuum tubes.\n\nDetails\nThe crossbar was introduced by HP Labs scientists in the Journal of Applied Physics, which provides a basis for constructing logic gates using memristors. The crossbar latch consists of a signal line crossed by two control lines.  Depending on the voltages sent down the various lines, it can simulate the action of the three major logic gates: AND, OR and NOT.\n\nThe abstract of the patent is as follows:\n\nApplications in arithmetic processing\n\nGreg Snider of Hewlett-Packard created this application, which uses crossbar latches to imitate the functionality of a half adder, which is the foundation of modern computing systems.  A crossbar tile is created in this application from a layer of horizontal row wires and a layer of vertical column wires, with memristor or similar materials sandwiched between the horizontal and vertical wire layers. Each crossbar tile intersection or junction can be configured to be in a high-resistance state with little or no current flowing between the horizontal and vertical wires, or in a low-resistance state with current flowing. Fig. 1 illustrates the configuration of a half-adder using a crossbar tile, as taught by Snider, with the nodes identifying junctions of the crossbar tile configured as low-resistance states. By setting different logic inputs A, NOT A, B, and NOT B to different row wires this configuration produces the sum and carry outputs typical for a half-adder. Connections between multiple half-adders may then be used to form full adders in accordance with conventional arithmetic architectures.\n\nApplications of crossbar latch in neuromorphics\n\nCrossbar latches have been suggested as components of neuromorphic computing systems. One implementation of this is in the form of a neural network formed from nanowires as discussed in a patent by Greg Snider of Hewlett-Packard.\n\nSee also\n\nMemristor\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n \n Research could send transistors the way of the vacuum tube (HP Press Release)\n HP claims molecular computing breakthrough (ComputerWorld)\n\nElectrical components", "Blues Hall of Fame je ka\u017edoro\u010dn\u011b ud\u011blovan\u00e1 cena.

It is famous for its part in the history of musical notation, in particular solmization.  The hymn belongs to the tradition of Gregorian chant.\n\nIt is not known who wrote the melody. Guido of Arezzo possibly composed it, but he more likely used an existing melody. A variant of the melody appears in an eleventh-century musical setting of Horace's poem Ode to Phyllis (4.11) recorded in a manuscript in France.\n\nStructure\nThe hymn uses classical metres: the Sapphic stanza consisting of three Sapphic hendecasyllables followed by an adonius (a type of dimeter).\n\nThe chant is useful for teaching singing because of the way it uses successive notes of the scale: the first six musical phrases of each stanza begin on a successively higher notes of the hexachord, giving ut\u2013re\u2013mi\u2013fa\u2013so\u2013la; though ut is replaced by do in modern solf\u00e8ge. The naming of the notes of the hexachord by the first syllable of each hemistich (half line of verse) of the first verse is usually attributed to Guido of Arezzo. Guido, who was active in the eleventh century, is regarded as the father of modern musical notation. He made use of clefs (C & F clefs) and invented the ut-re-mi-fa-sol-la notation. The hymn does not help with the seventh tone as the last line, Sancte Iohannes, breaks the ascending pattern. The syllable si, for the seventh tone, was added in the 18th century.\n\nThe first stanza is:\n\nUt queant lax\u012bs\nreson\u0101re fibr\u012bs\nM\u012bra gest\u014drum\nfamul\u012b tu\u014drum,\nSolve poll\u016bt\u012b\nlabi\u012b re\u0101tum,\nS\u0101ncte Iohann\u0113s.\n\nIt may be translated: So that your servants may, with loosened voices, resound the wonders of your deeds, clean the guilt from our stained lips, O Saint John.\n\nA paraphrase by Cecile Gertken, OSB (1902\u20132001) preserves the key syllables and loosely evokes the original meter:\nDo let our voices\nresonate most purely,\nmiracles telling,\nfar greater than many;\nso let our tongues be\nlavish in your praises,\nSaint John the Baptist.\n\nUt is now mostly replaced by Do in solf\u00e8ge due to the latter's open sound, in deference to Italian theorist Giovanni Battista Doni. The word \"Ut\" is still in use to name the C-clef. The seventh note was not part of the medieval hexachord and does not occur in this melody, and it was originally called \"si\" from \"Sancte Ioannes\" (Johannes). In the nineteenth century, Sarah Glover, an English music teacher, renamed \"si\" to \"ti\" so that every syllable might be notated by its initial letter. But this was not adopted in countries using fixed-do systems: in Romance languages \"si\" is used alike for B and B flat, and no separate syllable is required for sharp \"sol\".\n\nLiturgical use\nIn the Roman Rite, the hymn is sung in the Divine Office on June 24, the Feast of the Nativity of John the Baptist. The full hymn is divided into three parts, with \"Ut queant laxis\" sung at Vespers, \"Antra deserti\" sung at Matins, \"O nimis felix\" sung at Lauds, and doxologies added after the first two parts.\n\nSee also \n Diatonic and chromatic\n Do-Re-Mi (song).

It contains historical descriptions of the main towns and villages of the former County of Flanders, in addition to the lives of its counts and bishops. The works is lavishly illustrated. It contains etched portraits of historical figures and heraldic representations but it is specifically known for its maps and topographical views which form an important source for historic study. The Latin work knew several editions and translations until well into the 18th century. In Dutch it was published under the title Verheerlykt Vlaandre (Glorify Flanders).\n\nSanderus' predecessors \nSanderus tells us in his Sanderus Apologidion that the biggest inspiration for his Flandria Illustrata was the Theatrum sive Hollandiae Comitatus et urbium nova descriptio Marcus Zuerius Boxhornius (Boxhorn Nl), which in 1632 was published by the Amsterdam based publisher and engraver Henricus Hondius. It was Sanderus' goal to surpass his predecessors, both in terms of completeness and quality.\n\nIllustrations \nAs the title Flandria Illustrata underlines it is more lavishly illustrated than its earlier Dutch example.\nApart from city maps in cavalier projection, major civil and ecclesiastic buildings and structures such as town halls, guild houses, fortifications, churches and convents are represented, mostly in bird's eye view. Rural places are often represented with a view of the local castle or country house, underscoring the feodal structure of the county. Many illustrations have been provided by the artist and surveyor Vedastus Du Plouich. City maps of larger cities such as Brugge and Ghent however are based on older published sources such as Braun and Hogenberg's 'Civitates Orbis Terrarum'. In the case of the map of Ghent for example the map is oriented in a different direction and the representation of some streets and fortifications is updated.\n\nPublication \nThe writing and publishing of Flandria Illustrata did not run without a hitch. After the plan was conceived, Sanderus contacted the publisher Henricus Hondius, who had published the work of Boxhorn. The contact went through an intermediary named Johannes D'Hondt, a nephew of the publisher and an acquaintance of Sanderus. There was one major problem: Hondius, based in a Calvinist Republic, was a Protestant. This would mean that the book would be difficult to obtain in Catholic Flanders, but it would also put Sanderus, a canon, in a bad light. Protestant publishers had already found a solution to this problem: the book was printed and published in the Protestant Republic, but under the name of a Catholic publisher from Cologne.\n\nFrom 1632 Sanderus began with the first studies for his work. In 1634 he signed a contract with Hondius. After some time tensions arose: Hondius had begun the work with the material he already received, but had to interrupt the production process repeatedly because of articles and drawings that were still lacking. Hondius himself remained not free from blame: he sent back several drawings and maps for (unnecessary) corrections while failing to implement the corrections that Sanderus suggested. Hondius was so thoroughly tired of the situation that he sold the Flandria Illustrata to its competitor brothers Blaeu without even notifying Sanderus nor Johannes D'Hondt. Meanwhile the publication already advanced fairly well. Although the publication was initially planned for Easter 1637, it would take almost four more years until the first volume appeared on April the first 1641.\n\nThird volume \nSanderus also prepared a third volume containing a description of French Flanders, Tournai and the Tournaisis that was titled; Icones Urbium, Villarum, Castellorum et Coenobiorum Gallo-Flandriae, quae Tertia Pars est Flandriae illustratae. Although it was already prepared in detail, including the preparatory drawings for the maps and illustrations by Vedastus du Plouich , this volume was never published. The drawings by du Plouich survived and are kept in the manuscript department of the Royal Library of Belgium.\n\nNotes\n\nReferences \nCaullet, G., De gegraveerde, onuitgegeven en verloren geraakte teekeningen voor Sanderus\u2019 Flandria Illustrata, Antwerpen, 1908\nDe Borchgrave, O., 'Henricus Hondius en de eerste uitgave van Sanderus\u2019 Flandria illustrata', Handelingen van de Koninklijke Geschied- en Oudheidkundige kring van Kortrijk, jrg. x (1979), nr. 96, pp. 95-113\nDe Vleesschauwer, C., De Flandria illustrata van Antonius Sanderus: alfabetisch register van het illustratiemateriaal in de twee Latijnse edities (1641, 1732) en in Verheerlijkt Vlaandre (1735), Brussels, 1978\nFris, V., 'Sanderus', Biographie Nationale, XXI, Brussels, 1913, pp. 317-367\nGalesloot, L., La Flandria illustrata de Sanderus.

Durham was born on 24 September 1936 in East Ardsley, West Yorkshire, where he spent his formative years, and died on 6 December 2013 in the town of \u00c1lora, Andalusia, Spain. Mostly self-taught, he studied and was greatly inspired by the works of Paul Klee and other European artists such as Picasso, Gauguin and Matisse. He attended the Leeds College of Art before pursuing painting as his profession.\n\nEarly years\nIn 1960, Durham moved to St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly where he and his wife worked in the Atlantic Hotel for two years. There, he found inspiration in the rugged island landscape, and the sunny and temperate climate of the Islands produced \"good conditions for painting\". It was while working on the island and through his group of friends there that Durham heard of the growing art scene in London. After a short return to Yorkshire, he moved with his family to Beckenham, Kent in 1964.\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s\nWhile living in Beckenham, Durham got to know Nicholas Treadwell, and was one of the regular artists with work on \"Nicholas Treadwell's Mobile Art Gallery\", based in Croydon. He was one of the first artists to show at the Nicholas Treadwell Gallery on Chiltern Street in London when it opened in 1968. Durham's early London exhibitions were widely covered in the local press, bringing him into the media spotlight and to the attention of figures such as Bill Wyman, Muriel Spark, Lulu and Andrew Bown.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Durham moved back to Yorkshire, where he continued to work while holding exhibitions in London. He formed friendships with Stuart Walton, a local artist specialising in northern street scenes, and with Austin Mitchell, who was at that time the presenter of the Yorkshire TV news programme Calendar.\n\nOne of his paintings was analysed by biologist and science historian Jacob Bronowski in an episode of the 1973 television series The Ascent of Man and the accompanying book:\n\nIn the mid-1970s, Terry Durham produced the first of a series of children's art books, based on a character of his own creation named Angus Pangus. It was a black on white line drawing work produced and printed in limited edition by Robin Alston at the Janus Press in Ilkely.\n\n1980s to 2000\nIn 1993, Durham moved with his family to the Algarve, southern Portugal, where he lived for 11 years. During his time there, in addition to painting professionally, he had many successful exhibitions, was employed regularly as a mural painter and performed as vocalist for a rock and blues band. He was particularly inspired by the people, climate, colours, landscape and architecture of southern Portugal.\n\nDuring this time, Durham also had several international exhibitions, including five in Berlin and one on the island of Jersey. One of his \"Yellow Bird Walking\" series is displayed in Rickenbakers Music Inn in Berlin and while he was there he met one of his jazz heroes, Coco Schumann, who expressed a great appreciation of and fondness for his work.\n\nIn 2003, Durham moved to Porto Seguro in the Bahia municipality of north-east Brazil, the vibrant colours, wildlife and tribal cultures of which influenced the paintings and sketches he would complete both during his time there and across the rest of his life.\n\nAs well as spending his time painting and travelling, he was commissioned by a Portuguese and Jamaican themed beach restaurant and music venue, That Shack, to decorate the venue with murals.\n\nMusic and poetry\nMusic and poetry were also important to Durham, and he formed a musical group called Storyteller with Roger Moon, Mike Rogers and Caroline Attard. Storyteller toured local jazz and folk clubs and were signed by Transatlantic Records. They recorded two albums: Storyteller, produced by Peter Frampton and More Pages. The group appeared on the same bill as The Humblebums (Gerry Rafferty and Billy Connolly), Hawkwind, and Vinegar Joe (Elkie Brooks and Robert Palmer). Storyteller also appeared as a support act for a UK tour by Ralph McTell, beginning at the Royal Festival Hall, London, shortly after which they split up.\n\nDurham went on to record his only solo album, Crystal Telephone, in 1969. It had musical arrangements by John Coleman and featured the saxophonist Evan Parker. It was re-released in 2005, and the track \"Dreams Of Tomorrow In Every Language\" was played on the Stuart Maconie Radio 6 Music Show Freakier Zone in 2012. Crystal Telephone has been described as \"a wonderfully different album\", \"Yorkshire's answer to Serge Gainsbourg\" and \"a beautiful piece of poetry and music - a very unique balsam for the soul\".\n\nLater life\nDurham lived and worked in \u00c1lora, Andalusia from 2007 until his death on 6 December 2013. He had major individual and combined exhibitions in both \u00c1lora and Malaga, and participated in regional art competitions. When not painting professionally he taught art classes for children and adults. His work was displayed in various establishments in \u00c1lora as murals and caricatures, and he was known in the area as \"el artista\" (the artist) or \"el maestro\" (the teacher).\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n http://www.terrydurham-artist.com\n\n1936 births\n20th-century English painters\nEnglish male painters\n21st-century English painters\n20th-century English male artists\n21st-century English male artists\n2013 deaths", "The 1st Utah Senate District is located in Salt Lake County, which includes Salt Lake City, and includes Utah House Districts 20, 22, 23, 26, 29, 31 and 33.\n\nThe current State Senator representing the 1st district is Luz Robles Escamilla.

He is fondly remembered during a preseason exhibition game against the Dallas Cowboys. Late in the game and down by one score, Richardson led the Oilers within striking distance. The drive culminated with a play during which he, a right-hander, completed the winning touchdown pass with his left arm.\n\nRichardson was the starter for nearly half of the season and he split time with Carlson and Billy Joe Tolliver, none of the three being particularly effective as the Oilers stumbled their way to a league-worst 2\u201314 record.

His family emigrated to Canada in 1939, settling in Halifax. (He became a naturalized citizen in 1953.) Laufer obtained his bachelor of music degree from the University of Toronto in 1957 and his Masters of Music degree from the same institution in 1960. He studied composition with John Weinzweig, John Beckwith, Oskar Morawetz, and T\u0101livaldis \u0136eni\u0146\u0161. Some time after 1960 he temporarily settled in the New York area, attending the Juilliard School where he studied piano with Eduard Steuermann and composition with Vincent Persichetti. At Princeton University, he studied composition with Milton Babbitt, Earl Kim, and Roger Sessions. While in the New York area, he studied Schenkerian analysis privately with Ernst Oster. Laufer obtained a Masters of Fine Arts from Princeton University in 1964.\n\nBefore returning to Canada, he taught at Smith College from 1969 to 1971, the State University of New York at Purchase from 1972 to 1974, and the Mannes College of Music from 1973 to 1974. Moving back to Toronto, he was composer-in-residence from 1974 to 1975 at the University of Toronto, and then became a member of its Faculty of Music.\n\nHe gave lectures in Canada, the United States, Finland, and England. He published articles in Perspectives of New Music, Journal of Music Theory, Music Theory Spectrum, and ''Int\u00e9gral.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n The Edward Laufer Electronic Archive (ELEA) at the University of North Texas\n\n1938 births\n2014 deaths\nUniversity of Toronto alumni\nJuilliard School alumni\nPrinceton University alumni\n20th-century Canadian composers\nCanadian male composers\nAcademic staff of the University of Toronto\n20th-century Canadian male musicians", "The 2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Nevada was held on November 3, 2020, to elect the four U.S. representatives from the state of Nevada, one from each of the state's four congressional districts.

It covers not just economic relations, but broader political issues and cooperation.\n\nThe Australian Government maintains a delegation to the EU at its embassy in Brussels. A Delegation of the European Union is located in Canberra.\n\nHistory \nAustralia's relationship with Europe is a result of the historical connections generated by colonialism and mass European immigration to Australia. Possible first sightings of mainland Australia by Portugal and Spain have been theorized. However, the first documented European landings occurred since March 1606 by Holland. Australia would later be explored and conquered between the 18th and 19th centuries by the British Empire.\n\nTrade\n\nThe EU is Australia's second largest trading partner, after China, and Australia is the EU's 18th. Australia's exports are dominated by mineral and agricultural goods, while 37% of trade is in commercial services, especially transportation and travel. EU corporations have a strong presence in Australia (approximately 2360) with an estimated turnover of \u20ac200 bn (just over 14% of total sales in Australia). These companies directly created 500,000 jobs  in Australia.  The EU is Australia's second largest destination of overseas investment and the EU is by far Australia's largest source of foreign investment \u20ac2.8 billion in 2009 (\u20ac11.6 billion in 2008). Trade was growing but ebbed in 2009 due to the global financial crisis.\nIn August 2019, Australian Senator Simon Birmingham, released a list of names that the EU wants to protect as a part of its new trade deal. The list of proposed names included beers, spirits and cheese and meats, which as per EU is aimed at protecting the identity of European products from non-European products. This concept of segregation is known as \u201cgeographical indications\u201d or Gis, which will change the name of commodity in regards to the country of its origin.\n\nSee also\n\n Foreign relations of Australia\n Foreign relations of the European Union\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Australian mission to the EU\n EU mission to Australia\n European Union - Australian Department for Foreign Affairs and Trade\n \n\n \nEuropean Union\nThird-country relations of the European Union", "\"Hip Hop Holiday\" is the debut single from New Zealand hip hop group 3 The Hard Way.

Polysialic acid is considerably anionic. This strong negative charge gives this modification the ability to change the protein's surface charge and binding ability. In the synapse, polysialation of NCAM prevents its ability to bind to NCAMs on the adjacent membrane.\n\nStructure \nPolysialic acid (polySia) is polymer of linearly repeating monomer units of \u03b12,8- and \u03b12,9-glycosidic linked sialic acid residues. Sialic acid refers to carboxylated 9-carbon sugars, 2-keto-3-dexoxy-D-glycero-nononic acids. An unusual property of this sugar is that it often polymerizes into polySia. This is accomplished by attaching the monomers to the nonreducing end of the glycan. This mostly consists of Neu5Ac subunits. It is polyanionic and bulky, meaning there is little ability to reach its central molecules. polySia is useful in signaling in vertebrates and on the cell surface of few glycoproteins and glycolipids causing modifications, and it has been recently found that the function of polySia relates almost directly to its degree of polymerization. The number of units can range from 8 to greater than 400. This vast range causes differences in the polySia's ability to adhere different cells, assist in cellular migration, synapse formation, and regulate adhesion in nerve cells by modeling and formating them. polySia's most prominent role is in post-translational modifications in a few proteins, with the main one being NCAM. polySia links to adhesion molecules causing their adhesive properties to be subdued allowing for the detailed control of cell migration and cell to cell relations. This is caused by polySia's bulky and polyanionic properties.\n\nThe human body produces polySia naturally and attaches it to a various number of proteins. This is done by linking polySia on the \u03b12,3- or \u03b12,6- terminal of the glycoprotein. O-linked glycosylation through threonine or N-linked glycosylation through asparagine is employed. This polySia linkage is found in proteins such as NCAM, E-selectin ligand 1 (ESL-1), C\u2013C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7), synaptic cell adhesion molecule-1 (SynCAM-1), neuropilin-2 (NRP-2), the CD36 scavenger receptor found in the milk of humans, and the \u03b1-subunit of the voltage-sensitive sodium channel. The synthesis of polySia is enzymatically formed by \u03b12,8-sialyltransferase (ST8Sia) in a Type II transmembrane protein located on the Golgi Apparatus membrane. ST8Sia does this by adding sialic acids to the terminal end of the glycan through the CMP-sialic acid donor at various lengths depending on necessity. The length is controlled extensively by the expression of polysialyltransferase enzymes, once again controlling the function of polySia.\n\nDiscovery and methods of detection \npolySia was discovered in E. coli K-235 by Barry and Goebel in 1957. E. coli is an encapsulated, gram-negative bacteria in which Barry and Goebel studied, pinpointing polySia, which they called colominic acid. Following this discovery, multiple other bacterial capsules abundant in glycans were found to contain polySia. This included Neisseia meningitidis serogroups B and C in 1975. This was done by the use of a horse anti-polySia polyclonal antibody, being one of the first effective immunochemical probes. This was revolutionary as the anti-polySia antibodies were used to find polySia on proteins and cells. Mannheimia haemolytica A2, Moraxella nonliquifaciens, and E. coli K92 were found in 2013. Due to the capsule containing polySia, many scientists have tried to generate vaccines for these specific bacteria, notoriously difficult to target. However, their successes have been numbered as \u03b12,8-polySia is naturally produced by humans. Another issue is that polySia found in bacteria does not produce a solid or consistent immune response.\n\nAnother method of polySia detection relies on molecular labeling with fluorescence. This process, started in 1998, involves exposing \u03b12\u21928-linked N-acylneuraminic acid (Neu5Acyl) to periodate oxidation causing the terminals to be oxidized and in between untouched. If C9 compounds are observed after this exposure it indicates the presence of polySia. The way these can be numbered is by anion exchange chromatography after periodate oxidation with the label 1,2-diamino-4,5-methylenedioxybenzene (DMB) on C7 and C9. It is known that there are many different structures of polySia and these were difficult to recognize and detect until this fluorescent labeling, making it very advantageous.\n\nFunction in humans \npolySia is involved in many natural human functions. The major examples include membranes, neuron signaling, the immune system, neutrophil extracellular trap formation, and macrophage and microglia function. First, polySia makes membrane modifications due to interactions with a variety of factors. These could include repulsive forces between the polyanionic polySia and the mostly negatively charged glycocalyx.  Because of these interactions the membrane is edited in its ability to interact with other cells, its surface charge distribution, inter-membrane interaction, pH, and membrane potential. Hydration and charge were noted before and after removing polySia from a membrane and a 25% decrease in the distance between cells was observed. This is due to the anti-adhesive properties of polySia. polySia does not only have repulsive interactions, as there are positive charge molecules located in lipid rafts, such as NCAM.  The interaction between polySia and NCAM greatly affects NCAM's signaling ability as its composition is altered when they meet. Other forms of neuron signaling polySia is involved in include brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). With nearly the same mechanism, the act of polysialylation causes BDNF or FGF2 complexes through electrostatic interactions. This allows for the binding of polySia and these complexes causing polySia to be a reservoir. polySia then regulates the concentration of neurotrophins. Because they are not allowed to diffuse, signaling is more efficient. polySia is also found on immune cell surfaces. Some of the proteins are known, but many are not and the mechanisms are still being studied. However, it is known that polySia is in regulatory functions in the immune system leading to protection from invaders and response to damaged tissue. polySia is involved in NETosis which is a reactionary function of the body in the presence of foreign invaders. It is the intentional death of neutrophils. polySia ensures that this targeted cell death does not kill cells that are healthy and unaffected, as well as containing antimicrobial attributes. This is done by polySia by binding to lactoferrin, another antimicrobial molecule, surrounding neutrophils. polySia binding causes a tighter shell of lactoferrin around the cell membrane. polySia binds with Siglec-11 allowing for the regulation of microglia through exosomes. This shows that polySia binding with Siglec-11 causes a delay in neurodegeneration and control of neuroinflammation. polySia also limits inflammation in macrophages. polySia was found to have limited the expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF).\n\nReferences \n\nMolecular biology", "Galen is an almost exclusively masculine given name.

The term has its origin in onomatopoeia. The word \"beep-beep\" is recorded for the noise of a car horn in 1929, and the modern usage of \"beep\" for a high-pitched tone is attributed to Arthur C. Clarke in 1951.\n\nUse in computers\nIn some computer terminals, the ASCII character code 7, bell character, outputs an audible beep. The beep is also sometimes used to notify the user when the BIOS is not working or there is some other error during the start up process, often during the power-on self-test (POST). A beep is also made when holding down too many keys at the same time, as the computer often cannot handle the processes.\n\nThe command-line interfaces of the ReactOS, PTS-DOS, SISNE plus, and AROS operating systems include a beep command.\nA beep command is also part of ASCII's MSX-DOS2 Tools for MSX-DOS version 2.\n\nUse in transport\nBeeps are also used as a warning when a truck, lorry or bus is reversing. It can also be used to define the sound produced by a car horn. Colloquially, beep is also used to refer to the action of honking the car horn at someone, (e.g., \"Why did that guy beep at me?\"), and is more likely to be used with vehicles with higher-pitched horns. \"Honk\" is used if the sound is lower pitched (e.g. Volkswagen Beetles beep, but Oldsmobiles honk. On trains, beeps may be used for communications between members of staff.\n\nUse in telecommunication\n\nCall waiting\nA beep is also  a colloquialism for a zip tone to indicate a telephone call coming in on the same phone line as someone is currently speaking, either on a landline or mobile phone. The call waiting feature often outputs an audible \"beep\" noise to indicate that there is a second call coming in.\n\nPaging\nThe electronic pager is often referred to as a \"beeper\" for the sound it emits to alert its owner to an incoming message.\n\nCall back request\nAs a noun, the practice of \"beeping\" in sub-Saharan Africa refers to the cell phone phenomenon during which a person dials a number but immediately cancels the call before it is answered in order to elicit a call back from the recipient. One reason for this practice is to elicit a recipient to call back when the caller has almost run out of prepaid units for his/her cell phone but still wants or needs to talk to the recipient. In Rwanda, this practice has evolved into an art for courting between men and women, where women \"beep\" males in order to elicit a call back, which manifests the man's interest and willingness to pay for the woman's call. At times, this practice can be an inconvenience for the recipient, and at times, people ignore the \"beeps.\" \"Beeping\" is also known as \"flashing\" in sub Saharan Africa, and is known as \"menacing\" or \"fishing\" in Indonesia.\n\nCensorship\n\nThe use of profanity and offensive language on free-to-air broadcasts in the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Thailand, and Japan is sometimes censored by replacing the profane word or phrase with an audible beep(s), often accompanied by obscuring the speaker's mouth to prevent lip-reading.

The Council of State approved Occitania as the new name of the region on 28 September 2016, coming into effect on 30 September 2016.\n\nThe modern administrative region is named after the larger cultural and historical region of Occitania, which corresponds with the southern third of France. The region of Occitania as it is today covers a territory similar to that ruled by the Counts of Toulouse in the 12th and 13th centuries. The banner of arms of the Counts of Toulouse, known colloquially as the Occitan cross, is used by the modern region and is also a popular cultural symbol. In 2015, Occitania had a population of 5,839,867.\n\nToponymy\n\nEnacted in 2014, the territorial reform of French regions had been subject to debate for many years. The reform law used as the new region's provisional name, the hyphenated names of its predecessors: Languedoc-Roussillon and Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, in alphabetical order. As for most of the merged regions, a permanent name was then proposed by the new regional council to replace that provisional name. On 24 June 2016, the Regional Council of Languedoc-Roussillon-Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es adopted the name Occitania after lengthy public consultation. The provisional name of the region was withdrawn on 30 September 2016, when the new name took effect.\n\nOccitania, the new name, derives from the historical appellation of the broader region, and refers to the historical use throughout that territory of the Occitan language and its various dialects, which are so named for the word , the Occitan word for  or \"yes\". The circa 450,000 French Catalans living in the region (or Catalans of the North, as they mostly call themselves) expressed dismay at the regional assembly resolution, regarding the new name as ignoring their presence. On 10 September 2016, some 10,000 people (7,800 according to the police) demonstrated in Perpignan, demanding that the merged region name contain the words  (literal translation: \"Catalan country\").\n\nGeography\nOccitania is the second-largest region in mainland France, covering an area of ; it has a population of 5,845,102 (2017). It has a Mediterranean coast on the southeast and is neighboured by Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d'Azur on the east, Auvergne-Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes on the northeast and Nouvelle-Aquitaine on the west and northwest, as well as foreign borders of Andorra (Canillo, Encamp, La Massana, Ordino) and Spain (Aragon and Catalonia) on the south.\n\nDepartments\n\nMajor communities\n\nThe largest communes of Occitania are (population :\n Toulouse (479,553)\n Montpellier (285,121)\n N\u00eemes (150,610)\n Perpignan (120,158)\n B\u00e9ziers (77,177)\n Montauban (60,810)\n Narbonne (54,700)\n Albi (50,759)\n Carcassonne (47,365)\n\nEconomy\nThe gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 171.2 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 7.3% of French economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 26,000 euros or 86% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 102% of the EU average.\n\nPolitics\nFollowing the creation of the region in 2016, Carole Delga, a member of the Socialist Party, was elected to the presidency of the Regional Council of Occitania. The , where the Regional Council of Occitania meets, is situated in Toulouse.\n\nHistorical identity\n\nThe new administrative region includes provinces and territories of diverse cultural and historical origin: Languedoc (High and Low Languedoc), Pa\u00efsos Catalans (Roussillon, Cerdanya, Vallespir, Conflent, Capcir), the County of Foix, and the eastern parts of what was formerly Gascony (Armagnac, Comminges, Couserans, Bigorre, Condomois, N\u00e9bouzan, Rivi\u00e8re-Verdun), and Guiana (Carcin, Roergue). During the Ancien R\u00e9gime, most of these territories lay within the jurisdiction of the Parlement of Toulouse, founded in 1443.\n\nOccitania\n\nOccitania ( or  in Occitan) is a historical region of southwestern Europe in which Occitan was the main vernacular language. This territory was already united, in Roman times first as the Diocese of Vienne and then as the Seven Provinces () and in Aquitaine at the beginning of the Middle Ages (Aquitanica, Visigoth kingdom of Toulouse), before the Frankish conquest. Occitania is characterized by \"the Occitan culture\", since the Middle Ages another expression of Romance culture in France and to a lesser extent in Italy, Spain and Monaco. It is presented and recognized on institutional sites of French communities, such as those of the Lot-et-Garonne County Council and the city of Agen.\n\nLanguedoc\n\nMost of the territory that came to be called Languedoc (the region where  is spoken; in Occitan , ) became attached to the Kingdom of France in the 13th century, following the Albigensian Crusade (1208\u20131229). This crusade aimed to put an end to what the Church considered the Cathar heresy, and enabled the Capetian dynasty to extend its influence south of the Loire. As part of this process, the former principalities of Trencavel (the Viscounty of Albi, Carcassona, Besi\u00e8rs, Agde and Nimes) were integrated into the Royal French Domain in 1224. The Counts of Toulouse followed them in 1271. The remaining feudal enclaves were absorbed progressively up to the beginning of the 16th century; the County of G\u00e9vaudan in 1258, the County of Melgueil (Maugui\u00f2) in 1293, the Lordship of Montpellier in 1349 and the Viscounts of Narbonne in 1507.\n\nThe territory falling within the jurisdiction of the Estates of Languedoc, which convened for the first time in 1346, shrank progressively, becoming known during the Ancien R\u00e9gime as the province of Languedoc.\n\nThe year 1359 marked a turning point in the history of the province.  The three bailiwicks () of B\u00e8ucaire, Carcassona and Tolosa had the status of  (towns granted privileges and protection by the king of France in return for providing a contingent of men at arms). In that year, the three entered into a perpetual union, after which their contribution of royal officers was summoned jointly rather than separately for each of the three . \n\nTowards the end of the 14th century, the term \"country of the three seneschalties\" (), later to become known as Languedoc, designated the two bailiwicks of B\u00e8ucaire-Nimes and Carcassona, and the eastern part of Tolosa (Toulouse), retained under the Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny. At that time, the County of Foix, which belonged to the seneschal of Carcassona until 1333 before passing to Toulouse, ceased to belong to Languedoc. In 1542, the province was divided into two : Toulouse for Haut-Languedoc, and Montpellier for Bas-Languedoc. This lasted until the French Revolution in 1789. From the 17th century onward, there was only one intendance for the whole of Languedoc, with its seat in Montpellier.\n\nHaute-Guyenne\n\nThe former provinces of Gascony (in Gascon , ), and Guyenne; in Occitan  ) were historically part of the Great South-West of France (), and derived from the medieval duchyies of Vasconia, Aquitaine and then Guyenne. Today, only the eastern regions of the two provinces are part of Occitania. These areas correspond essentially to the territories acquired by the kings of England, dukes of Guyenne, under the treaty of Br\u00e9tigny of 1360, and which then remained under the jurisdiction of the provincial appellate court of Toulouse (Parlement of Toulouse) after the creation of the Parlement of Bordeaux in 1462. From that time, they were generally grouped under the name of Haute-Guyenne, by opposition with Basse-Guyenne, which was dependent on the Parlement of Bordeaux.\n\nThe territory of the former province of Guyenne (Guiana) that lies within the region corresponds with Quercy (the current department of Lot and the north of Tarn e Garona), and with Roergue (Avairon). These two counties are thus part of the Occitan linguistic area, in its Languedocien dialectal variant. They were possessions of the Counts of Toulouse from the 9th century, at various stages a minor branch or the main branch. Like the other possessions of the Counts of Toulouse, they were integrated for the first time with the French royal domain in 1271,and then yielded to the kings of England under the 1360 Treaty of Br\u00e9tigny. The province of Quercy was definitely reunited with the Crown in 1472; Roergue, possession of the counts of Armagnac, did not follow until 1607. Both came within the province of Guyenne, under military rule from 1561. Together, they became the  of Montauban from 1635, which then became the province of Haute-Guyenne in 1779. Today, the name Guyenne no longer has administrative or political currency, although the Haut-Agenais used the term  in a campaign which evoked its historical identity to promote the Lot-et-Garonne and part of the valley of Dr\u00f2t. This reference is now superseded in the promotion of tourism by the designation . The appellations Quercy and Roergue, in contrast, retain a strong identity.\n\nGascony is the former province located on the territory of the current departments of Gers (Armanhac and Condomois), Hautes-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es (Bigorre), Lanas in the neighboring region, and parts of other departments of the two regions of Aquit\u00e0nia and Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es (Comenge, Nebosan and Rivi\u00e8re-Verdun mainly in the south and west of Haute-Garonne, and Couserans in the western part of Ari\u00e8ge). Successively called Aquitania, Novempopulania, Vasconia (territory of the Vascones) and Gascony in the 13th century, the territory was geographically diverse, situated between the Atlantic Ocean, Garona and the Pyrenees. Claiming a cultural identity based on evolving occupation, from the Aquitani peoples of Proto-Basque language to a Gascon population sharing a latinized Occitan dialect, it constitutes the current Gascon linguistic area. Between the 15th and the beginning of the 16th centuries, it was progressively integrated into the Royal French domain. Comenge yielded to the kings of France in 1443, extinguishing the local dynasty. Armagnac, Bigorre and Nebosan followed, with the county of Foix, in 1607.\n\nCounty of Foix (Fois)\nThe County of Foix is an old French county created out of the County of Carcassonne in around 1050 for Bernard Roger, son of Roger I of Carcassonna. In 1398, the county passed to House of Grailly and, in 1458, King Charles VII of France raised it to the Peerage of France in favor of Gaston IV, Count of Foix.\n\nThe county-peerage passed to the House of Albret in 1484, and then to House of Bourbon-Vend\u00f4me in 1548. In 1607, King Henry IV of France attached the county to the Royal French domain.\n\nFrom the time of the French Revolution, the county was fully incorporated into the department of Ari\u00e8ge. The Occitan dialect traditionally spoken there is Languedocien.\n\nRoussillon\n\nThe Ancien R\u00e9gime province of Roussillon, which had formerly been integrated with the Catalan counties, the Kingdom of Majorca, and the Principality of Catalonia within the Crown of Aragon, was attached to the Crown of France under the Treaty of the Pyrenees, signed on 7 November 1659. Prior to this treaty, the border between the kingdom of France and the Principality of Catalonia lay further north, along a line of citadels (Treaty of Corbeil).\n\nThese territories corresponded to the Catalan counties of Roussillon and Conflent, founded in the 9th century, as well as to the northern part of the County of Cerdanya, to which was added the former Vicounty of Castelnou, or Vallespir (the pagus of County of Besal\u00fa, united with the County of Roussillon in 1209). The new Province of Roussillon also known simply as Roussillon, brought together the medieval administrative courts, or vigueries, of Roussillon, Conflent, and the north of the County of Cerdanya which were part of the government structure of the Crown of Aragon's (and attached to the Principality of Catalonia) counties of Roussillon and Cerdanya (governaci\u00f3 dels comtats de Rossell\u00f3 i Cerdanya in Catalan) at the time of their attachment to France. Roussillon was subject to direct taxation as a pays d'imposition (taxing country) and did not have representation through the Estates (a provincial assembly, the provincial assembly of Roussillon, was created on 15 August 1787). It formed both a government and an intendance and reported to the Secretary of State for War as a border province. It had sovereign jurisdiction: the Sovereign Council of Roussillon, independent of the Parlement of Toulouse.\n\nCurrently, the name Roussillon is still the most widely used to designate this territory, being found in the denomination of the former region of Languedoc-Roussillon.\n\nToday, the territory is often subdivided into five unofficial traditional and natural comarques: Roussillon proper, Vallespir, Conflent, Upper Cerdanya and Capcir. A recent addition is Fenouill\u00e8des, the Occitan part of the department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Orientales.\n\nSee also\n Languedoc-Roussillon\n Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es\n Occitania\n Regions of France\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n Merger of the regions - France 3\n R\u00e9gion Occitanie/Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e -\n\n \nRegions of France\n2016 establishments in France\nStates and territories established in 2016\nFrance geography articles needing translation from French Wikipedia\n2016 establishments in Europe\nMassif Central", "The Bardstown Historic District, comprising the center of Bardstown, Kentucky, is a registered historic district on the National Register of Historic Places.

Over one third of the buildings in the district are Federal or Georgian architecture dating from the 1780s to 1850, reflecting Bardstown's status as one of the first towns in Kentucky, first settled in 1780 and formally established in 1788.  Twenty-four of the blocks are in the initial grid pattern used to lay out the town's lots in 1797.\n\nThe town was originally to be called Salem when it was first settled in 1780 by 33 people, on land given as  grant to John Owings and David Bard by Virginia governor Patrick Henry.  Bard sent his brother William Bard to manage the holdings, and with William donating  for a courthouse, the town was renamed Bardstown.  In 1789 alone 150 log houses were built in the district.  In the antebellum area the district became a cultural center for nearby localities, especially for Catholics; Bardstown had the largest concentration of Catholics of any town in Kentucky for a time.  Its decline began when the Louisville and Nashville Railroad decided to initially bypass Bardstown, not building a railroad for the town until 1860, and not extending the line from Bardstown until 1887, after which Bardstown's population remained steady until it became the center of bourbon production.\n\nAt different times during the Civil War, commanders from both armies held their headquarters within the district.\n\nThe Old Courthouse, which lies in the center of the district surrounded by US 31E and US 150, was constructed in 1892 at the cost of $30,000.  It now serves as the Visitor Center for Bardstown, with the new courthouse being built where the original Wal-Mart in Bardstown was located.\n\nThanks to the Nelson County Historical Society and the 1965 Historical District Zoning laws, much of the district retains its historical nature, save for a few commercial buildings along Third Street, also known locally as Louisville Road (which eventually reaches Louisville, where it is called Bardstown Road).  By the 1980s over 200,000 tourists visited the town, which has steadily increased due to the continuing attractions of the Kentucky Bourbon Festival and My Old Kentucky Home State Park, located on the next hill to the east of the historic district.\n\nUnited States President Jimmy Carter held a town hall meeting in the district in 1979.\n\nGallery\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nHistoric districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky\nNational Register of Historic Places in Bardstown, Kentucky\nGeography of Nelson County, Kentucky", "Hermann August Teuchert (3 March 1880 \u2212 13 January 1972) was a German historical linguist.\n\nTeuchert was born in Loppow (Neumark) In 1920 he was granted the newly created professorship for Low German Philology at the University of Rostock and served in this position until 1946.

As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 1,948.\n\nHistory\n\nThe town of Montgomery was founded in the middle of the Lake Creek Settlement by W. W. Shepperd in July 1837 on 200 acres of land that had originally been part of the John Corner League. Shepperd had established the first store in the Lake Creek Settlement in 1835. W. W. Shepperd and his partner John Wyatt Moody named the town Montgomery.\n\nMontgomery became the first county seat of Montgomery County shortly after the county was created on December 14, 1837.  Montgomery County was the third county formed during the Republic of Texas. The county originally extended from the Brazos River to the Trinity. The city was officially incorporated in 1848 with Judge Nathaniel Hart Davis as mayor.\n\nOrigins of the city's name\nLocal histories and accounts by 20th century historians held that the city and county of Montgomery were named after a family of early settlers to the area: Andrew Montgomery or Owen and Margaret Montgomery Shannon. However, recent evidence provided by Kameron Searle suggests that it is more likely that the town and county were named after Lemuel P. Montgomery, a major in the U.S. Army during the Creek War. John Wyatt Moody, one of the founders of Montgomery, was County Clerk of Montgomery County, Alabama before moving to Texas. Montgomery County, Alabama, is named for Lemuel P. Montgomery. Sam Houston, the President of the Republic of Texas when the town and county of Montgomery were founded, served in the Battle of Horseshoe Bend with Lemuel P. Montgomery, and witnessed his death in the front lines of the battle.  According to Searle, Moody and his partner W.W. Shepperd may have used Houston's connection with Lemuel Montgomery to help promote the creation of Montgomery County, with the town of Montgomery as the county seat.\n\nBirthplace of the Lone Star Flag?\nOn July 7, 1922, Edmund B. Stewart, son of the early Montgomery settler Charles B. Stewart, claimed in a letter that his father had drafted the original design of the Lone Star Flag, enclosing what he claimed was his father's draft of the flag's design. To date, this letter and draft copy, along with claims by Stewart's descendants, remain the only evidence currently known that Charles Stewart was the designer of the flag. In particular, the lack of evidence not directly tied to the Stewart family has caused many flag historians to question Stewart's claim. As a legacy of the Stewart claim, the city of Montgomery describes itself as the \"birthplace of the Texas Lone Star Flag.\"\n\nGeography\n\nMontgomery is located at 30\u00b023'22\" North, 95\u00b041'53\" West (30.389406, \u201395.698089).\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of .  of it is land and  of it is water.

Kung took money that he made from the success of the Westland Oil Development Corp. in the 1970s and used it to build the bunker, since he feared that the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China would launch nuclear weapons towards the United States. Kung bought hundreds of acres of cow pasture on the outskirts of Montgomery and secretly began building the bunker. The two story,  bunker could house at least 700 people; Kung intended to have the bunker house his employees, their families, and others in case of a two-month emergency. Melanie Trottmann of The Wall Street Journal stated that the bunker \"was a source of intrigue and gossip for the town of Montgomery.\" After the oil bust in the 1980s, Kung lost the title to the property; Kung died in 1996. Trottman said that the bunker \"sat frozen in time\" until a group of investors bought the property. The facility, now called \"Westland Bunker,\" serves as a data storage center for businesses. The facility also contains office space that corporations can use in the event of a disaster.\n\nNotable people\n\n Norm Branch, major league baseball pitcher.

She is a Fellow of the American Psychological Association and was one of Barack Obama's Champions of Change.\n\n\nEarly life and education \nByars-Winston earned her bachelor's (1991) and master's (1992) degree at San Diego State University. She completed a predoctoral clinical fellowship at the University of Maryland, College Park. She attended graduate school at Arizona State University, specialising in counseling psychology. Her 1996 dissertation placed her on the national policy-making stage. She was one of only two black PhD students in the School of Education at Arizona State University in the fall of 1992.\n\nCareer \nByars-Winston joined the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison as a KL2 scholar in 1997. She joined the School of Medicine in 2011 and became interested in whether people bring their identity to the foreground of their college experience. Byars-Winston and her colleagues, Christine Pfund and Janet Branchaw, were awarded a $1.4 million R01 National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant to investigate how mentors define diversity and developing ways to measure the impact of mentored research experiences on career outcomes. Byars-Winston is also part of a national team which was awarded $19 million from the NIH to organize a National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN). She has investigated how to measure mentoring interventions. She has also conducted a longitudinal study that monitored how the relationships between undergraduate mentees and their mentors in the biological sciences impact their academic outcomes.\n\nOne of the approaches to meet the skills gap in the United States is to engage African Americans, Latino/as, South East Asians, and Native Americans ('ALANA') with science and engineering subjects. Byars-Winston used social cognitive career theory to examine how ethnicity influenced academic self-efficacy and outcomes. She has identified several barriers to the progression of ALANA investigators, including the marginalization of interests, apartheid within academia and microaggressions. Byars-Winston demonstrated that race and ethnicity impact career expectations more than aspirations. She launched the Training and Education to Advance Minority Scholars in Science program (TEAM-Science) and Culturally Aware Mentoring (CAM) programs, which look to embed self-reflective dialogue about race and ethnicity in science. She is working with the National Academy to examine the effectiveness of programs that look engage individuals marginalized in STEM fields.\n\nBarack Obama named Byars-Winston as one of the United States' Champions of Change in 2011. The Presidency of Barack Obama established a Educate to Innovate campaign, which looked to improve the engagement of young people with science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). She is a member of the National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity STEM Equity Pipeline National Advisory Board and Wisconsin Career Development Association Executive Committee.\n\nShe won the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Outstanding Woman of Color Award in 2014. In 2016 Byars-Winston was a visiting professor at Purdue University, where she ran a series of mentoring workshops. She published the Promising Practices for Strengthening the Regional STEM Workforce Development Ecosystem. In 2017 Byars-Winston became the first African American to achieve the rank of tenured Full Professor of medicine at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison.

It was formed to provide both technical and social support for women Linux users, although men are encouraged to contribute. Members of the community are referred to as \"a Linux chick\" (singular) and \"LinuxChix\" or \"Linux Chix\" (plural) regardless of gender.\n\nHistory \nLinuxChix was founded in 1999 by Deb Richardson, who was a technical writer and web-master at an open source consulting firm. Her reason for founding LinuxChix was to create an alternative to the \"locker room mentality\" of some other Linux User Groups and forums. There are two core rules: \"be polite and be helpful.\"\n\nLinuxChix started as an electronic mailing list called grrltalk. The growth of this mailing list led to the establishment of other mailing lists, beginning with techtalk for technical discussions and issues for discussion of women's political issues. LinuxChix received attention when ZDNet published an article on it, which was subsequently cross-posted on Slashdot.\n\nLeadership and structure \nDeb Richardson oversaw the activities of LinuxChix until 2001, when she handed over global coordination and hosting to Melbourne programmer and writer Jenn Vesperman. Jenn Vesperman led the community in a mostly hands-off fashion, delegating almost all tasks, including mailing list administration and website maintenance, to a group of volunteers. During Jenn Vesperman's tenure, the number of mailing lists tripled with the newchix mailing list for those new to Linux, the courses mailing list used by LinuxChix to teach each other specific topics, and the grrls-only mailing list (the only list closed to male subscribers) founded by Val Henson in 2002. At around the same time, a LinuxChix IRC server was created.\n\nThe term LinuxChix refers to the organisation centered on the official website, the mailing lists and the IRC channels. The organisation has no official status, and the name is used by other loosely affiliated groups, including several local, continental, and national chapters which operate independently.\n\nIn March 2007, Jenn Vesperman announced that she was retiring as the coordinator and invited nominations for a new leader. Mary Gardiner was announced as the new coordinator In April 2007, planning to serve as coordinator until 2009, however she resigned in June 2007.  Currently the organization is led by three lead volunteers known as the \"Tres Chix\" who are elected by popular vote.  In August 2007, Sulamita Garcia, Akkana Peck and Carla Schroder were elected to these positions.\n\nRegional chapters \n\nLinuxChix has over 15 regional chapters around the world. In 2004, a chapter was founded in Africa. In March 2007, on the International Women's Day, Australia's two LinuxChix chapters united to form a nationwide chapter called \"AussieChix\". The New Zealand chapter was established in February 2007.\n\nEvents \nSome local LinuxChix chapters hold regular meetings. Others only meet up on special occasions, such as visits from non-local members or in conjunction with technical conferences. In 2007, members of the Sydney chapter organized a LinuxChix miniconf at linux.conf.au at the University of New South Wales. Events are held on other special occasions; in 2005, for example, LinuxChix Africa organized an event to celebrate Software Freedom Day at Wits University.\n\nLinuxChix labs\nThe Indian chapter of LinuxChix (aka IndiChix) led an initiative to establish Linux labs in a number of cities in India. These labs provide spaces equipped with PCs and internet connections where women can learn more about Linux and collaborate on contributions to the Libre software community. Labs have gone live in Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai, and Pune.\n\nSee also \nAda Initiative\nNational Center for Women & Information Technology\nAnita Borg Institute for Women and Technology\nGirl Geek Dinners\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n LinuxChix website\n LinuxChix regional chapters\n\nWomen in computing\nElectronic mailing lists\nFree and open-source software organizations\nInternet properties established in 1999\nLinux user groups\nOrganizations for women in science and technology\nMass media companies", "James Mason (Yorkshire, 15 de Maio de 1909 \u2014 Lausana, 27 de Julho de 1984) foi um actor brit\u00e2nico nascido na Inglaterra.\n\nBiografia \nJames Mason foi aluno do Col\u00e9gio Marborough e depois cursou a Universidade de Cambridge, onde se formou em Arquitetura, antes de decidir que tinha uma oportunidade melhor de ganhar a vida em um palco do que desenhando casas e pr\u00e9dios.\n\nEle se tornou ator teatral em 1930.

Like other test cards, it was usually shown while no programmes were being broadcast. It was the first to be transmitted in colour in the UK and the first to feature a person, and has become an iconic British image regularly subject to parody.\n\nThe central image on the card shows Carole Hersee playing noughts and crosses with a clown doll, Bubbles the Clown, surrounded by various greyscales and colour test signals used to assess the quality of the transmitted picture. It was first broadcast on 2 July 1967 (the day after the first colour pictures appeared to the public on television) on BBC2.\n\nThe card was developed by a BBC engineer, George Hersee (1924\u20132001), father of the girl in the central image. It was frequently broadcast during daytime downtime on BBC Television until 29 April 1983 and was still seen before the start of programmes until BBC1 began to broadcast 24 hours a day in November 1997, broadcasting BBC News overnight, and on BBC2 until its downtime was replaced entirely by Pages from Ceefax in 1998, after which it was only seen during engineering work, and was last seen in this role in 1999. The card was also seen on ITV in the 1970s, occasionally used in conjunction with Test Card G.\n\nIn the digital age, Test Card F and its variants are very infrequently broadcast, as downtime hours in schedules have largely been discontinued. Several variations of TCF have been screened, among them Test Card J (digitally enhanced), Test Card W (widescreen) and its high definition variant, which is sometimes erroneously referred to as Test Card X.\n\nUp until the UK's digital switchover in 2010\u20132012, the test card made an appearance during the annual RBS (rebroadcast standby) Test Transmissions and, until 2013, during the BBC HD preview loop, which used Test Card W.\n\nTechnical information\n \nVirtually all the designs and patterns on the card have some significance. Along the top (see above) are 95% saturation colour-bars in descending order of luminance\u2014white, yellow, cyan, green, magenta, red, blue and black. There are triangles on each of the four sides of the card to check for correct overscanning of the picture. Standard greyscale and frequency response tests are found on the left and right respectively of the central picture. On the updated version known as Test Card J (including widescreen and HD versions), the X on the noughts-and-crosses board is an indicator for aligning the centre of the screen.\n\nThe blocks of colour on the sides would cause the picture to tear horizontally if the sync circuits were not adjusted properly. The closely spaced lines in various parts of the screen allowed focus to be checked from centre to edge; mistuning would also blur the lines. All parts of the greyscale would not be distinct if contrast and brightness (both internal preset settings and user adjustments) were not set correctly. The black bar on a white background revealed ringing and signal reflections. The castellations along the top and bottom also revealed possible setup problems.\n\nIn the centre image, a child was depicted so that wrong skin colour would be obvious and not subject to changing make-up fashions. The juxtaposed garish colours of the clown were such that a common transmission error called chrominance/luminance delay inequality would make the clown's yellow buttons turn white. Use of centre images in test cards were however not a new idea; RTF and ORTF in France used the Marly Horses as the central motif of its monochrome 819-line test card which was used on TF1 between 1953 and 1983, and the first French colour test card featuring a centre image of colourful roses was used on France 2 from 1967 until sometime around the mid-1970s. SVT in Sweden was also later inspired by Test Card F to develop its own colour test card, based on its earlier monochrome test cards, with a girl holding a doll in the centre image.\n\nModern circuitry using large-scale integration is much less susceptible to most of these problems. Some of them are also associated with cathode ray tubes; liquid crystal displays (LCDs), that are not scanned at high speed. The test card was a vital tool in its day, but has become far less important.\n\nThe name of the broadcasting channel usually appeared in the space underneath the letter F\u2014a serif F denoting an original optical version of the test card.\n\nOriginally, Test Card F was a photographic slide made up of two transparencies in perfect registration\u2014one containing the colour information and the other the monochrome background. The card was converted to electronic form in 1984 when electronic storage became possible.\n\nAudio accompaniment\n\nA sound of some kind is usually transmitted in the background. It is either music, usually a composition commissioned by the station itself or \"royalty-free\" stock music, or a steady tone. Composers whose music has been used include Roger Roger, Johnny Pearson, Neil Richardson, Frank Chacksfield, Syd Dale, John Cameron, Brian Bennett, Keith Mansfield, and Alan Hawkshaw.\n\nIn recent years, the Test Card is only shown during engineering tests on the BBC and is accompanied by a steady tone of various pitches accompanied by a female talking clock. Test Card music had ceased to be frequently heard with the test card by the end of the 1980s, although it continued to be played over Pages from Ceefax until the termination of that service on 22 October 2012.\n\nBubbles the Clown\n\nAlong with his Test Card F co-star Carole Hersee, Bubbles has appeared for an estimated total of 70,000 hours on television, equivalent to nearly eight whole years, which is more than any living person other than Carole (who still owns Bubbles).\n\nColour\nBubbles's original body colour was blue and white, but the BBC engineers decided that green was also needed within the scene as the other two television primary colours, red and blue, were already shown. A green wrap was made to cover his body and this can be seen in Test Card J and Test Card W, along with more of his body shown in the photograph \u2014 revealing the fact that he is actually holding a piece of chalk, which was not previously visible.\n\nHowever, the shade of green material chosen was too subtle for the engineers' liking and so Bubbles' body colour in Test Card F was retouched (this can be seen from the edges of his image) to make it more saturated and also to give it a higher luminance value on screen.\n\nOverseas usage\nTest Card F was also used in approximately 30 countries outside the UK. Notable overseas users included:\n Bahrain Radio and Television Corporation in Bahrain\n DR in Denmark\n NRK in Norway, briefly in the 1970s\n SVT in Sweden, briefly in the 1970s\n STW-9 in Perth, Australia\n TCN-9 and TEN-10 in Sydney, Australia\n NBN-3 in Newcastle, Australia\n Radio Television Singapore (RTS)/Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC), albeit with the original centre image replaced with another slide featuring a puppet resembling Bubbles the Clown and four girls, one of each of the four official races of Singapore. This particular test card was introduced in 1974 along with the Philips PM5544 test card upon the introduction of colour television in Singapore, replacing a modified 625-line version of Test Card C, and remained in use until teletext was introduced to Singapore in 1983.\n New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC)/Television New Zealand (TVNZ), alongside the Philips PM5544 as well as a modified version of TCF called the T1 test card, with different centre image. TCF and T1 test cards were introduced in 1973 upon the introduction of colour television in New Zealand, and used until teletext was introduced to NZ in 1985.\n\nVariants and updated versions\n\nTest Card J \n\nTest Card J is an updated version of Test Card F, and first appeared in November 1999. It includes the following changes relative to its predecessor:\n\n A newly added green square at the top of the screen is used to facilitate easier observation of chrominance to luminance delay.\n The negative black squares in the left hand step pattern should flash on and off at 1 Hz. This is to aid in the detection of frozen digital links.\n The central image is based on the same source photograph, but with some minor adjustments:\n It has been rescanned from the original transparency for improved colour accuracy.\n The image has been re-aligned within Test Card J such that the cross on the noughts and crosses board is at the exact centre of the screen, as some believe was originally intended.\n It is less tightly cropped, resulting in more edge detail from the original photograph being visible.\n\nTest Card W \n\nTest Card W is an updated 16:9 (1.78:1) widescreen version of Test Card F. It first appeared in November 1999 alongside Test Card J, with which it bears some similarities.\n\nThe colour-bars on the top and right of the image are the full 100 percent saturation version, unlike Test Cards F and J which use the 95 percent type. Extra mirrored arrow-heads on the central axis at the sides mark the positions of the middle 4:3 and 14:9 sections of the image.\n\nOn Freeview in the United Kingdom, Test Card W can be viewed at any time on most Freeview boxes.\n\nBBC HD channel variant (\"Test Card X\")  \n\nA 1080 line variant of Test Card W (sometimes referred to unofficially as Test Card X) was used on the now-defunct BBC HD channel. It could be viewed every two hours as part of the BBC HD preview slot. When viewed, it was enhanced with 5.1 surround sound tests. A BLITS tone is played alongside, which plays test tones at different frequencies from each of the different surround sound speakers, with markers (such as L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs) appearing inside some of the grey boxes of the testcard. BBC HD closed in March 2013; therefore Test Card X is no longer broadcast.\n\nBBC Two variant (2016) \n\nFrom August 2016 until July 2019, the latest iteration of the widescreen testcard could be seen briefly each morning at 7:00 am on BBC Two and BBC Two HD. At the centre bottom of the test card is an animated grey bar with graduations corresponding to 1/12 of a second. The animation is accompanied by a 'pip' that occurs when the animated bar reaches the centre mark (indicated by a 0), which together can be used to determine whether the digital audio and video signals are synchronised.\n\nRecent years\n \nIn May 1983, trade test transmissions of the test card ended when Ceefax pages began to be shown during all daytime intervals. This meant that Test Card F was only seen for a few minutes early in the morning.\n\n1992 was the last year that Test Card F was seen daily with music; 1995 was the last year it was seen with music, although it was seen until 1999 with just tone output, and Ceefax was broadcast either with tone or music. However, since the closure of Ceefax, the shutdown of analogue television transmissions, and the imposition of budgetary constraints, a new revision of the testcard can be seen daily on BBC Two and BBC Two HD at the end of the \"This is BBC Two\" transmission. Each morning, as the segment concludes, the testcard is broadcast for approximately one minute.\n\nSince the late 1990s, Bubbles has only very rarely appeared on television, as Test Card F has been discontinued, and Test Cards J and W are very seldom shown, due to the advent of digital television and 24-hour programming.\n\nFor the fortieth anniversary of Test Card F, there was some renewed interest in Bubbles in the media; in a 2007 interview, Hersee mentioned that she took Bubbles into school with her to prove to her headmaster that she really was the girl in the picture.\n\nThe BBC website previously featured Bubbles next to a blackboard with \"404\" inscribed on it when a user visited a page that did not exist; however, some time between July 2017 and May 2020, this was replaced with an image of two \"clangers\" (animated puppets) from the BBC television show Clangers. Similarly, in 2015 the BBC website's \"500\" Internal Error page featured a cross-eyed Bubbles appearing in front of a blackboard with a background of fire; however, this has since been replaced with the same error message seen on the 404 page.\n\nPrior to the relaunch of BBC Three in 2022, Test Card F aired for periods of 20 minutes.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nVariations and parodies of Test Card F are common in British broadcasting, Internet sites and games. Some prominent examples include:\nWhile the Independent Broadcasting Authority used a variation of ETP-1 for its test D-MAC transmissions, the franchisee British Satellite Broadcasting used test cards reminiscent of both Philips PM5544 and Test Card F for public satellite transmissions.\nThe TV series Life on Mars features a Test Card Girl based on Test Card F, who teases and torments the lead character, Sam Tyler.\nParodies have been used in promotional material or videos for many songs, often with band members' faces, including Radiohead's 2000 album Kid A, \"(Waiting For) The Ghost Train\" by Madness, and the Gorillaz music video \"Hallelujah Money\".\nThe test card has also been used in the Numberblocks episode \"Tween Scenes\", with Ten replacing Carole Hersee and Three replacing Bubbles the Clown.\nDave Allen At Large included a parody of Test Card F, where a hand came out and completed the game of noughts and crosses.\nThe Animaniacs (2020 TV series) segment \"The Flawed Couple\" featured a parody of Test Card F with Pinky in place of Carole Hersee and the Brain wearing clown makeup in place of Bubbles.\nRuPaul's Drag Race UK contestant Cheddar Gorgeous wore a runway look inspired by Test Card F for the season four runway \"Keeping it 100!\", which was in honor of the BBC's 100th anniversary\n\nSee also\nList of BBC test cards\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\nBBC links\nTest card special (BBC News, 19 April 2001)\nDown-loadable test card wallpaper from the BBC\n\nInterviews\nCarole Hersee interview marking the 40th anniversary of test card F\nInterview about the Mighty Boosh's Test Card F parody\n\nOthers\nThe Test Card Circle Fan group site includes history of the BBC and ITA Test Cards, the music, and details about the Trade Test Colour Films shown from the late fifties to 1973.\nA history of the BBC's test cards\nCarole Hersee Biography on Youtube\n\nBBC test cards\n1967 establishments in the United Kingdom\nTelevision shows about clowns\nTelecommunications-related introductions in 1967\nTic-tac-toe\nBritish inventions", "The Spoils are an Australian band from Melbourne, consisting of Sean Simmons and Bronwyn Henderson, who are known for their dark urban balladry and side-show themed vignettes.\n\nHistory\nThe Spoils (previously called The Losing End) was formed towards the end of the 20th century in St Kilda, Victoria.

She serves as a straight foil and love interest for the eccentric Dick Solomon.\n\nCasting\nCurtin was recruited to play Mary by friend Bonnie Turner after another actress was deemed too sweet for the part. Co-star John Lithgow said, \"We really needed a very strong human comic presence. . . . Someone who could give it out and dish it out.\" Curtin had earlier worked with Bonnie and Terry Turner on Saturday Night Live and in the 1993 film Coneheads.  She originally signed for just seven episodes, but soon agreed to extend her commitment. \"I loved the character, but I also loved the sense of humor on the show,\" she later explained. \"I had known John in New York, and I'm very comfortable with him. It made me laugh when John and I were working together -- there just would be puddles on the floor.\"\n\nReflecting on the show in 2005, Lithgow remarked \"Jane was just perfect for it. She's a great comedy partner. She understands the role of a straight man; however, she also has a terrific streak of wildness herself so she creates this wonderful repressed character who occasionally spins out just as much as the aliens do.\"\n\nOccupation\nMary works as a professor of Anthropology at the fictional Pendelton State University in Rutherford, Ohio. For approximately six months during the sitcom's 4th season, Mary served as dean of Pendleton's School of Arts and Sciences. However, she lost this job and returned to her role as professor after she was caught breaking into friend and colleague Judith's office after Dick convinced her that Judith was after her job.\n\nRelationship with Dick\nMary and the 'father' of the alien group, who works at Pendelton as a physics professor, were forced to share an office. While Dick was attracted to her almost instantly, Mary took a long time to warm to Dick. After their initial success, Dick and Mary enjoyed an on-off relationship; Dick would often annoy Mary, causing her to grow angry and seemingly break up with him. However, in the next episode, they are nearly always back together (notable exception: when Dick was engaged to Mary, then discovered another alien had been sent to masquerade as his wife, leading Mary to believe he is committing polygamy. Even then, she forgave him.)\n\nWhen Dick and his 'family' are called back to the home planet, Mary discovers Dick's alien identity; she is initially persuaded to return with them. However, she realises how much she would miss Earth, so Dick wipes her memory of him and his family. In an alternate ending, Dick returns and abducts her.\n\nHistory\nFrom hints in the show, Mary formerly drank a lot and often used her femininity to get what she wanted from men. From references and one episode about her parents, it appears that her father had affairs and her mother drank a lot. Mary comes from a seemingly average but trashy family, but she and sister Renata have become successfulRenata is rich, while Mary is a professor and doctor. In one episode, Dick marries Renata, in order to divorce her and get her to promise she will not build a library at Pendelton that will cast a shadow in Mary's office. Renata was played by guest star Megan Mullally (best known for playing Karen Walker on Will & Grace). Mary also has a younger brother, Roy Albright (Bronson Pinchot), who claims to have been abducted by aliens. This completely freaks out the family; to this end Sally and Harry take Roy out a cornfield to \"killroy\" as the plan is called. In the end, he is found out to be lying.\n\nAs seen in \"The Dicks They Are A'Changin'\", Mary was a part of the 1960s counterculture in her youth (flashbacks showed her dressed in hippie garb), though she mentions she \"never made it to Woodstock\". Mary attended UC Berkeley in the late '60s and was apparently involved in the Free Speech Movement there.\n\nAt one point during her youth, she worked at a Dairy Queen.\n\nAlternate universe\nIn the episode \"Dick'll Take Manhattan\" from the sixth season, in which Dick, Harry and Sally enter into an alternate reality, an alternate universe Mary has a completely different personality and life. She is a shallow, airheaded and 'slutty' lounge singer at a dive bar in Manhattan. She uses her feminine wiles to get money and gifts from men. She attempts to do so with Dick Solomon but finds herself falling in love.\n\nPets\nMary used to own fish, before Dick was left to look after them as Mary was on a conferencehe introduced an angelfish, which ate all the others. Mary was angry with Dick for killing her fish, calling him a \"jackass\". Dick subsequently bought her a dog to compensate. After breaking off their engagement, Mary tries to get rid of the dog, but realizes she loves him. She and Dick later get back together, making Mary relieved she didn't get rid of her dog. On several occasions throughout the show, Mary's dog would come running onto the set and start humping her.\n\nTrivia\n In the episode \"Dick's Ark\", it is revealed she is known at her local supermarket as \"The White Zinfandel Lady.\"\n Mary's passport and credit card both say \"Mary Albright, Ph.D.\"\nJane Curtin, the actress who portrays Mary, also played an alien (Prymaat Conehead from Saturday Night Live). Her full name is also similar as Prymaat's alias in the 1993 Coneheads film: Mary Margaret DeCicco.\n\nNotes\n\nExternal links\n\n3rd Rock from the Sun characters\nFictional characters from Ohio\nFictional female doctors\nFictional professors\nFictional anthropologists\nTelevision characters introduced in 1996", "Gymnastics events were competed at the 2018 South American Games in Cochabamba, Bolivia, from May 26 to June 8, 2018.\n\nParticipating nations\n\nMedal summary\n\nArtistic gymnastics\n\nRhythmic gymnastics\n\nTrampoline\n\nMedal table\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n 2018 South American Games \u2013 Artistic gymnastics \n 2018 South American Games \u2013 Rhythmic gymnastics \n 2018 South American Games \u2013 Trampoline \n\n2018 South American Games events\nSouth American Games\n2018 South American Games\n2018 South American Games", "\"Slabtown\" is the fourth episode of the fifth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series The Walking Dead, which aired on AMC on November 2, 2014. The episode was written by Matthew Negrete and Channing Powell, and directed by Michael E. Satrazemis, who is the series' director of photography. In the episode, Beth Greene (Emily Kinney) finds herself in an operational hospital in Atlanta after being abducted in the previous season. Beth discovers that the hospital is ruled by a brutally enforced system and slowly plans her escape. Emily Kinney and Melissa McBride are the only regulars to appear in this episode, though McBride only appears in the final scene, whereas Kinney appears throughout the episode.\n\nPlot\nBeth awakens in Grady Memorial Hospital and is greeted by two survivors, Lt. Dawn Lerner and Dr. Steven Edwards. Dawn explains that her officers found Beth unconscious on the side of a road, surrounded by \"rotters\", and they saved her life. Dawn tells Beth that as a rule of the hospital, she must repay them with labor, and Beth is assigned to Dr. Edwards as a nurse. They are called to tend to a new patient, Gavin Trevitt. Dr. Edwards immediately writes Gavin off as a lost cause, but Dawn insists Edwards try to save him. After Edwards is unsuccessful, Dawn becomes infuriated, and slaps Beth across the face, reopening her previous injuries.\n\nLater, Beth and Dr. Edwards must treat a worker, Joan (Keisha Castle-Hughes), who was bitten while attempting to escape the hospital. Despite Joan's pleas to be allowed to die, Dawn orders Dr. Edwards to amputate Joan's arm to prevent the infection from spreading. Beth meets another hospital worker named Noah (Tyler James Williams), who warns her that Dawn and her officers are more sinister than they seem. They only take in patients weak enough to control, and no ward has ever repaid their debts and been allowed to leave the hospital. He confides that he intends to escape and return to his community in Richmond, Virginia. A recuperating Joan warns Beth that Dawn chooses not to control her officers, and keeps their loyalty and morale high by allowing them to have their way with the patients, implying they have raped her.\n\nOne of the officers at the hospital, Officer Gorman (Cullen Moss), begins sexually harassing Beth but is stopped by Dr. Edwards. Beth asks Dr. Edwards why he stays at the hospital. Dr. Edwards explains that, in the aftermath of the bombing of Atlanta, the officers and surviving staff took shelter in the hospital until they ran out of supplies and were forced to scavenge. He tells her that a deal was made to take in and heal the injured in return for their labor, and says that no matter how bad conditions in the hospital get, it's a better alternative to the outside.\n\nDr. Edwards tells Beth to give Gavin, who is in life support, a dose of Clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic, which kills him. An angry Dawn demands to know what happened, and Noah lies and takes the blame. Dawn has Noah beaten as a punishment. Dr. Edwards insists to Beth that he told her to give Gavin Clonazepam, a benzodiazepine, rather than Clozapine. Dawn warns Beth that she knew Noah was lying but was forced to make an example of him for the greater good. Dawn tells Beth that she isn't strong enough for the world as it is, but Beth insists she is.\n\nThe next day, Beth and Noah plan to escape the hospital via the elevator shaft to the basement. While retrieving a key from Dawn's office, Beth finds the body of Joan, who has committed suicide. Beth is caught by Gorman, who offers his silence in return for sex. Beth hits him in the head with a lollipop jar, leaving him to be eaten by a reanimated Joan. Beth and Noah climb down the elevator shaft, but Noah gets attacked by a walker a few floors down and then falls and injures his leg, attracting walkers. Whilst escaping, Beth shoots some walkers with the gun she got from Gorman. Noah escapes, but Beth is recaptured in the parking lot after officers arrive.\n\nDawn confronts Beth about the deaths of Joan and Gorman. Beth tells Dawn that the two deaths were the result of the hospital's corrupt regime and that nobody is coming to rescue them. Dawn strikes Beth in anger. Later, while Dr. Edwards treats her injuries, Beth reveals that she discovered Gavin was a doctor. Dr. Edwards admits he knew Gavin, and he arranged his death in an attempt to remain indispensable to Dawn, ensuring his own survival. Appalled, Beth later obtains a pair of scissors with the intention of killing Dr. Edwards, but she is stopped in her tracks when a gurney carrying an unconscious Carol is brought into the hospital.\n\nReception\nUpon airing, the episode was watched by 14.518 million American viewers with an 18-49 rating of 7.6, an increase in viewership from the previous week which had 13.801 million viewers and an 18-49 rating of 7.0.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the episode was viewed by 1.218 million viewers, making it the highest-rated broadcast that week. It also received 0.102 million timeshift viewers. In Australia, it received 0.090 million viewers, making it the highest-rated cable broadcast that day.\n\nThe episode received generally positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a 7.7 out of 10, saying: \"As someone who actually enjoyed The Governor's two-episode diversion last season (while still realizing it was the show course-correcting in order to lead back to a legit prison battle), and also as someone who likes Beth, \"Slabtown\" was a bit of a drag. Not fully. There was some good stuff here. But it definitely was a hard comedown after the cannibal saga. So much so that it had me wondering (almost) the entire time what this new group's sinister secret was. And the truth, when revealed, wasn't really all that dark or exciting considering what we've already seen on this season.\"\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n\n\"Slabtown\" at AMC\n\n2014 American television episodes\nThe Walking Dead (season 5) episodes", "Alchemilla subsessilis \u00e9 uma esp\u00e9cie de ros\u00e1cea do g\u00eanero Alchemilla, pertencente \u00e0 fam\u00edlia Rosaceae.\n\nRefer\u00eancias\n\nBibliografia \n Alexander A.

Founded in 1833, it was the first Baptist church in the Cleveland, Ohio area and is the fourth oldest church in Cleveland.\n\nFounded in 1833, the church is a congregation of the American Baptist Churches, USA and the Cleveland Baptist Association of Churches.  It is in partnership with the Greater Cleveland Congregations.\n\nFounding \n\nThe founders of the church were Moses White, Benjamin, and Rebecca Rouse, and Mary Belden. They originally met in private homes.  As the congregation grew, they moved to the brick court-house on Public Square in Cleveland.\n\nOn November 19, 1832, a Baptist minister, Rev. Richmond Taggart from Lockport, New York preached for the group in a stop in Cleveland. The services were held in a meeting room on the upper floor of the Cleveland Academy.  Following the services, a group formed \"The First Baptist Society of Cleveland, Ohio.\"\n\nOn February 16, 1833, 17 individuals established the First Baptist Church of Cleveland. Charter members included African Americans John Malvin and his wife, Harriet (married 8 March 1829). The membership grew rapidly during their first year. A small church building (near Public Square) was built by the congregation for $18,000. The first permanent pastor was Rev. Levi Tucker who was installed in April 1836 and served until 1842. In 1855, the Plymouth Church building was purchased to provide additional space for the growing congregation.\n\nAbolitionist congregation \n\nCharter member John Malvin came to the church with a license to preach the Gospel from the Enon Baptist Church in Cincinnati. Malvin refused to allow segregation of the races during services, a common practice at that time. His stance persuaded the congregation to permit anyone to sit anywhere they choose,  He frequently preached at First Baptist. Several key members of the congregation assisted Malvin in helping runaway slaves, setting up classroom education, and in efforts to overturn Ohio's Black Codes. The church was a supporter of the Ohio Anti-Slavery Society.\n\nIn 1849 First Baptist supported a mission to establish the first African American Baptist Church of Cleveland, Shiloh Baptist Church.\n\n\"Father John\", Malvin remained a lifetime member of First Baptist Church of Cleveland.  He died on July 1, 1880, at his Cleveland home and was buried in the Erie Street cemetery.\n\nEducation and growth \n\nFollowing Rev. Levi Tucker, the church called Reverend Seymour W. Adams, D.D. in November 1846 to serve the church until his death on September 24, 1864.\n\nIn 1852, a cottage Sunday School was established near Dodge street given by Judge Bishop and James Root of Hartford, Conn. Deacon B. Rouse was the first superintendent. Over the next fourteen years, the group grew by over a hundred members. A member of the church, Stillman Witt, gave generously to the congregation. A tablet was erected in the church sanctuary in his memory upon following his death on April 29, 1875.\n\nIn October 1865, Rev. Dr. Augustus Hopkins Strong became pastor of First Baptist Church. Strong was a graduate of Yale  He served until 1872 when he went from there to become president of Rochester Theological Seminary. His book  Systematic Theology (1886) was a recognized major theological work of the period for those of the Baptist Faith.\n\nIn 1874, the Idaka Sunday School was organized and grew from 128 to 255 students under Dr. A. J. Behrends (June 1873-February 1876) and Dr. George W. Gardner (October 1876 - June 1878). Dr. Gardner came from Marblehead, MA but left shortly after his arrival to become president of Pella University, Pella, Iowa,  Rev. Philip S. Moxom became pastor on April 1, 1879, and served until August 1885.\n\nBy the late 1880s, the First Baptist had outgrown its building and explored a union with members of the Idaka Chapel which had been a mission of the church but formed their own independent congregation in 1880. The churches consolidated on April 28, 1887, with a new church building uniting them together at the corner of Prospect and Kennard Street.  This was the third building of the First Baptist Church.  The church had a tower 120 feet high with Amherst sandstone exterior. The church was built debt-free when the cornerstone was laid on September 29, 1889.\n\nIn 1900, seventeen members of the church formed the East Cleveland Baptist Church. Ministers of the period included Dr. A.G. Upham (September 1892-March 1897), Dr. William Lowndes Pickard (October 1897-January 1902), and Dr. Herbert F. Stilwell (March 1903-May 1916). Dr. Stilwell was the national leader in the Northern Baptist Convention. He left the congregation to become the General Superintendent of Evangelism for the American Baptist Home Mission Society.\n\nDr. David Bovington became pastor in January 1917, coming from Rochester Theological Seminary where he taught homiletics for ten years. Born in England when America joined the Great War,\u201dhe cheered and comforted many a sad heart too brave to complain.\" He was a strong advocate for world missions.\n\nMany prominent families in the Cleveland community were leaders within First Baptist: Deacon Gustavus A. Hyde (Head of Engineering of Cleveland Gas Company), Deacon Samuel W. Burrows (Second Lieutenant 27th New York Cavalry and prisoner of war during the American Civil War), Deacon Louis A. Osborn, Deacon Oscar Townsend President of the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railway, Henry A. Sherwin (one of the founders of the Sherwin-Williams Company), Deacon Chandler Snow, Deacon John Ralph Owens, Deacon A.L. Talcott (President of the Cleveland Baptist Home Mission Society and leader of the Prohibition Party), and Deacon Jacob Faber.\n\nDuring this period, several groups out of the congregation formed new Baptist works in the growing communities of Cleveland. These include The Euclid Avenue Baptist (the church home of John Davison Rockefeller), Willson Avenue Baptist Church, Superior Avenue Baptist Church, Trinity Baptist Church, Church of the Master, and East Cleveland Baptist Church.\n\nFormation of First Baptist Church of Greater Cleveland \n\nDuring the 1920s the congregational leadership began conversations with the Cleveland Heights Baptist Church to unite in order to build a modern church. Cleveland Heights Baptist had been meeting in a school beginning in 1926. Their merger formed the First Baptist Church of Greater Cleveland, together they chose to relocate in the middle of the growing communities of Cleveland Heights, Shaker Heights and University Heights.\n\nThe architectural firm of Walker and Weeks was chosen to create plans for the new building to be located in Shaker Heights. The building largely features Indiana limestone constructed in a Neo-Gothic design with a large interior courtyard. A 130-foot bell tower became the most prominent feature of the church thanks to donations from Ambrose Swasey. The tower was named the Swasey Tower in his honor.  Among its many features include angelic faces facing four directions overlooking the community (similar to the Art-Deco statues designed by sculptor Henry Hering and architect Frank Walker \u2013 titled the \"Guardians of Traffic on the Hope Memorial Bridge.)The stone sculptor of FBCGC's Guardians was Walter Sinz (1881 \u2013 1966). His best-known work was the Thompson Trophy- the prize for the premiere aircraft racing 1921\u20131961. He was educated at the Cleveland School of Art, where he also taught from 1911 to 1952. When the final design of the church was presented, the Van Sweringen Company who oversaw the development of the area canceled the final payment of $25,000.\n\nThe construction took over a year. The church building was formally dedicated in June 1929. The building was designated a Shaker Heights Landmark on January 24, 1977.\n\nThe church sanctuary stained glass windows were donated by various families of the congregation from 1928 to 1949. Each glass panel was custom designed after the French Neo-Gothic style created by the Boston glass studios of Reynolds, Francis and Rohnstock.\n\nThe First Baptist Church of Greater Cleveland organ was built by The Austin Organ Company in 1911 for the building on Euclid. It was dismantled, enlarged, moved, and incorporated into the front and rear chambers of the Fairmont building sanctuary. It was rebuilt by the Austin Company in 1954 with additional work done by the Schlicker Organ Company in 1970. In the 1990s, during the ministry of Dr. Robert Schneider, Director of Music and Organist (1993-2018), with the assistance of Timothy Edward Smith, a consultant, the organ was upgraded by the Southfield Organ Builders of Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nDr. Harold Cooke Phillips served as the new building's first Senior Pastor in 1928.  He oversaw the church until 1958. A bronze bust of Dr. H.C. Phillips is found just off the main sanctuary, near the pulpit where he preached. Rev. Russell H. Bishop served the church as Senior Pastor following Dr. Phillips (1958\u20131976) who was followed by Rev. Gilbert F. Helwig (1977\u20131998), Rev. Chris Bennett (2003\u20132005) and Rev. Martin Rolfs Massaglia (2006\u20132014). Rev. Dr. Kregg Burris is the current Senior Pastor (2015\u2013present).\n\nEducation \n\nIn 1957 an educational wing of the church was added to the church and named after the director of Christian Education, Dr. Francis C. Wheaton. Soon thereafter, a weekday child care ministry was established. In 1974 the Children's Center of First Baptist Church was licensed as a daycare and preschool and remains so to the present. In 2016, the Cleveland Life Institute was established as a one-year program to advocate and instruct individuals in social enterprise and entrepreneurship. Its first class began in January 2017. Dr. Victor Bull is the current President of the Cleveland Life Institute.\n\nMusic and Fine Arts \n\nThe Neo-Gothic design of the Sanctuary has been utilized by many local performing arts organizations such as Apollo's Fire, a baroque orchestral ensemble under the direction of Jeanette Sorrel, the Cleveland Chamber Choir, the Suburban Symphony, the Heights Chamber Orchestra, and the Cleveland Opera.\n\nIn addition to the acoustically enhanced Sanctuary, the Spahr Center, named after the late Charles Spahr, former CEO of Sohio, has been the home of the Happy Ending Lyric Players (HELP) a community theater ensemble founded by church members in 1976. The Arts programs have been under the stewardship of G. Michael Skerritt since 1990. Annual selections of Broadway musicals, opera, operetta, drama, comedy, and dance are performed as part of the worship and fine art calendar.  Many of these events have been accompanied by visual art exhibits by local artists. \nIn 2018 First Baptist established The Heights Arts Initiative (THAI), a non-profit organization within the church to provide artistic outreach to the surrounding communities.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n Official website\n\nChurches in Cuyahoga County, Ohio\nBaptist churches in Ohio\nShaker Heights, Ohio", "Kitchen Creek is a tributary of Huntington Creek in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, in the United States.

The creek is designated as a high-quality coldwater fishery.\n\nCourse\n\nKitchen Creek begins in Fairmount Township, near the border between Sullivan County and Luzerne County. The headwaters of the creek are also immediately south of Cherry Ridge. The creek flows southeast for some distance, passing through Lake Lehigh. It then turns south-southwest and enters a deep valley known as the Kitchen Creek Gorge, traveling over numerous waterfalls as it passes through Ricketts Glen State Park, where it receives the tributaries Shingle Cabin Brook and Maple Spring Brook. Upon leaving Ricketts Glen State Park, the creek turns south-southeast and receives the tributary Boston Run. Further downstream, it picks up the tributary Maple Run. After a while, the creek passes through Patterson Grove and enters Huntington Township, where it almost immediately reaches its confluence with Huntington Creek.\n\nKitchen Creek joins Huntington Creek  upstream of its mouth.\n\nGeography, geology, and climate\n\nThe elevation near the mouth of Kitchen Creek is  above sea level.\n\nLakes, swamps, and mountains are present at the headwaters of Kitchen Creek. The topography of the creek's watershed is described as \"rough and hilly\" in a 1921 book.\n\nThe channel of Kitchen Creek is sinuous. The creek flows through rock formations made of sandstone and shale. There is a gorge and waterfall system on the creek. This system is known as the Kitchen Creek Ravines. The Kitchen Creek Falls, a system of waterfalls and rapids, flows through Ricketts Glen State Park. This system has more than 25 waterfalls and descends  in .\n\nThe rate of precipitation in the watershed of Kitchen Creek ranges between  and  per year.\n\nWatershed\n\nThe watershed (or drainage basin) of Kitchen Creek has an area of .

Emphasis is placed on using green manures and plant-based compost instead.\n\nMethods\n\nAnimal-free farming may use organic or non-organic farming methods. However, most detailed discussions of animal-free agriculture currently focus on animal-free organic variants. In the European Union, farmers have a financial incentive to use manure instead of animal-free fertilisers, since manure is subsidised. However, organic manure is not subsidised.\n\nIndustrial agriculture with synthetic fertilizers is animal-free. In the United States, few industrial farms use manure. Of all U.S. cropland, only 5% was manured in 2006.\n\nVegan organic farming\n\nVegan organic farming methods do not use animal products or by-products, such as blood meal, fish products, bone meal, feces, or other animal-origin matter because the production of these materials is viewed as either harming animals directly, or as associated with the exploitation and consequent suffering of animals. Some of these materials are by-products of animal husbandry, created during the process of cultivating animals for the production of meat, milk, skins, furs, entertainment, labor, or companionship. The sale of such by-products decreases expenses and increases profit for those engaged in animal husbandry and therefore helps support the animal husbandry industry, an outcome vegans find unacceptable.\n\nVegan organic growers maintain soil fertility using green manures, cover crops, green wastes, composted vegetable matter, and minerals. Some vegan gardeners may supplement this with human urine from vegans (which provides nitrogen) and 'humanure' from vegans, produced from compost toilets.\n\nVeganic organic farmers take measures such as refraining from making large disturbances in the soil of the land and cultivating a variety of plants in the ground. This form of farming \"encompasses a respect for the animals, the environment, and human health.\" Some of the plant-based techniques used in veganic agriculture include mulch, compost, chipped branched wood, crop rotation and others.\n\nFarms certified as biocyclic vegan use preventative methods to manage insects. If these fail, however, the label allows them to use insecticides such as Bacillus thuringiensis, which starves larvae to death.\n\nVegan organic farming is much less common than organic farming. In 2019, there were 63 self-declared vegan organic farms in the United States, and 16,585 certified organic farms.\n\nTimeline\n\n2006 \n\n The World Conservation Union's Red List of Threatened Species reports that most of the world's threatened species are experiencing habitat loss as a result of livestock production conducted through animal agriculture.\n Center for Science in the Public Interest releases Six Arguments for a Greener Diet that found that a plant-rich diet \"leads to much less food poisoning, water pollution, air pollution, global warming.\"\n\n2016 \n\n Research published in the journal Nature Communications finds that vegan diets have the best land use and are the only way to feed the global population by 2050.\n The World Resources Institute published the report: Shifting Diets for a Sustainable Food Future which showed that if people who consume large amounts of meat and dairy changed to diets with more plant-based meals could reduce agriculture's pressure on the environment.\n\n2017 \n\n University of Edinburgh researchers find that animal farming is the leading cause of food waste as it is responsible for the most losses of all harvested crops on Earth (40%) due to secondary consumption.\n Forbes magazine publishes a compilation of recent vegan and plant-based business successes noting that vegan living is becoming more a norm because of its positive impact on sustainability.\n\n2018 \n\n Research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences find that a vegan shift would increase the US food supply by a third, eliminating all of the losses due to food waste and feeding all Americans as well as roughly 390,000,000 more.\n A Harvard study found that shifting all beef production in the U.S. to pastured, grass-fed systems would require 30% more cattle, increase beef's methane emissions by 43%, and would require much more land than is available.\n\n2019 \n\n A report from the Humane Party determines that vegan-organic agriculture can be 4,198% more productive than animal-based agriculture in the amount of food produced per acre.\nVeganic farmer Will Bonsall told The Guardian that most vegetables are \"very un-vegan\" due to being grown using inputs of animal-based products.\n\nAdvantages \n\nLivestock in the United States produce 230,000 pounds of manure per second, and nitrogen from these wastes is converted into ammonia and nitrates which leach into ground and surface water causing contamination of wells, rivers and streams. Mature compost of plant-based origins, used in animal-free agriculture, can reduce leaching of nitrate which leads to an improvement in groundwater quality and counteracts the eutrophication of surface waters.\n\nAnimal free agriculture has the potential to prevent illnesses like influenza from spreading. Experts agree that most strains of the influenza virus that infect human beings came from contact with other animals. Farm animals on factory farms may be genetically similar therefore making them more susceptible to specific parasites. Infection among animals is more easily spread because of their close proximity to one another. Animal-free agriculture does not contribute to the spread of influenza through animals.\n\nCurrent use \nVegan France Interpro in collaboration with the Biocyclic Vegan Network created an interactive map that lists all-vegan organic projects across Europe. This list primarily includes agricultural operations but also trading and processing companies, online shops, network organizations as well as certification bodies that certify farms according to the Biocyclic Vegan Standard.\n\nThere is a similar map in North America that conducts the same concept and locates vegan farms around North America.\n\nThe Biocyclic Vegan Standard is an IFOAM-accredited organic standard for vegan organic farms. It is awarded by BNS Biocyclic Network Services Ltd (a Cypriot company), and has accredited 19 farms in Europe . The German Environment Agency awarded the German biocyclic vegan association some 60,000 euros for the promotion of the biocyclic vegan standard from 2021 to 2022.\n\n, 18 farms in the United Kingdom and Ireland are certified vegan organic by the Stockfree Organic label. Farms wanting to obtain the label are certified by the Soil Association, and the label's requirements are determined by the Vegan Organic Network.\n\nSee also \nForest gardening\nLivestock's Long Shadow\nVegan organic agriculture\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nSustainable agriculture\nVegan organic gardening\nVeganism\nVegetarianism", "Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo (Czech for Red Justice or The Red Right) was the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.\n\nHistory and profile\nRud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo was founded in 1920 when the party was splitting from the social democrats and their older daily Pr\u00e1vo lidu (People's Right). During the 1920s and 1930s it was often censored and even temporarily stopped. In autumn 1938 the party was abolished and during the German occupation and World War II that came soon afterwards the newspaper became an underground mimeographed pamphlet. Following the end of the war Josef Frol\u00edk became the chief administrator of the paper. After the communist take-over in 1948 it became the leading newspaper in the country, the Czechoslovak equivalent of the Soviet Union's Pravda, highly propagandistic and sometimes obedient to the government. Its Slovak equivalent in Slovakia was Pravda.\n\nRud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo had a circulation of over one million daily, making it the most widely distributed newspaper in Czechoslovakia. The communist government promoted its sales, for example, by sometimes forbidding other newspapers to be sold before 10am, or kiosk owners might be paid to not sell other papers at all, or the presses that printed rival newspapers could just be ordered not to print them.\n\nFollowing the Velvet Revolution, Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo was privatised in 1989. In addition, some editors founded a new daily, Pr\u00e1vo, unaffiliated with the party but taking advantage of the existing reader base.\n\nIn popular culture\n In the book Life is Elsewhere by Milan Kundera, Jaromil, the protagonist, makes a reference to reading Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo.\n In the 2006 movie Bobby, Svetlana Metkina plays a Czechoslovak reporter for Rud\u00e9 pr\u00e1vo who is granted an interview with Robert F.

It is the equivalent of terms such as Member of Parliament (MP) or Member of Congress used in other countries. The official translation of the term is \"Deputy to the D\u00e1il\", although a more literal translation is \"Assembly Delegate\".\n\nOverview\nFor electoral purposes, the Republic of Ireland is divided into areas known as constituencies, each of which elects three, four, or five TDs. Under the Constitution, every 20,000 to 30,000 people must be represented by at least one TD. A candidate to become a TD must be an Irish citizen and over 21 years of age. Members of the judiciary, the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, and the Defence Forces are disqualified from membership of the D\u00e1il.\n\nUntil the 31st D\u00e1il (2011\u20132016), the number of TDs had increased to 166. The 2016 general election elected 158 TDs, a reduction of 8, pursuant to the passage of the Electoral (Amendment) (D\u00e1il Constituencies) Act 2013. 159 TDs were elected to the 33rd D\u00e1il at the 2020 general election which was held on 8 February. As the Ceann Comhairle is automatically returned, there were 160 members of the 33rd D\u00e1il when it convened on 20 February 2020.\n\nHistory\nThe term was first used to describe those Irish parliamentarians who were elected at the 1918 general election, and who, rather than attending the British House of Commons at Westminster, to which they had been elected, assembled instead in the Mansion House in Dublin on 21 January 1919 to create a new Irish parliament: the First D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. Initially, the term 'Feisire D\u00e1il Eireann' (F.D.E.) was mooted, but 'Teachta' was used from the first meeting. The term continued to be used after this First D\u00e1il and was used to refer to later members of the Irish Republic's single-chamber D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (or 'Assembly of Ireland') (1919\u201322), members of the Free State D\u00e1il (1922\u201337), and of the modern D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.\n\nStyle\nThe initials \"TD\" are placed after the surname of the elected TD. For example, the current Taoiseach (head of government) is \"Leo Varadkar, TD\". The style used to refer to individual TDs during debates in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann is the member's surname preceded by Deputy (): for example, \"Deputy McDonald\", \"an Teachta N\u00ed Dhomhnaill/Bhean \u00dai Dhomhnaill\" or \"an Teachta \u00d3 Domhnaill\"\n\nSalaries and expenses\nThe basic salary of a backbench TD is \u20ac105,271. Cabinet ministers and junior ministers receive additional allowances. Office-holders (opposition party leaders, whips, the Ceann Comhairle, and Leas-Cheann Comhairle) also receive additional allowances.\n\nAfter controversy regarding alleged abuses of the Oireachtas expenses provisions, the system was simplified in 2009 and 2010 into two allowances:\n\nTravel and accommodation allowance \u2013 ranging from \u20ac9,000 for TDs less than 25\u00a0km from Leinster House to \u20ac34,065 for those more than 360\u00a0km away.\nPublic Representation Allowance \u2013 for maintaining a constituency office; \u20ac20,350 for backbench TDs, less for ministers. All expenses must be vouched, except for a \"petty cash\" allowance of \u20ac100 per month. Until December 2012 TDs could choose between a \u20ac25,000 vouched allowance or \u20ac15,000 unvouched.\n\nSee also\n\nMembers of the 1st D\u00e1il\nRecords of members of the Oireachtas\n\nReferences\n\n \nPolitics of the Republic of Ireland", "The three-masted schooner Victory Chimes, also known as Edwin and Maud or Domino Effect, is a US National Historic Landmark. She is the last surviving Chesapeake Ram schooner. The boat on the Maine State Quarter is meant to resemble the Victory Chimes.\n\nConstruction \nVictory Chimes was built at Bethel, Delaware in 1900 by George K. Phillips Co. She was named Edwin and Maud after the children of her first Captain, Robert E. Riggen.\n\nThe traditional \"ram\" rig was a standing jib, flying jib, staysail (also called a forestaysail), foresail, mainsail and spanker (or mizzen), which Victory Chimes carries today. The heads of the fore, main and mizzen sails are supported by gaffs and the feet are laced to booms ... The standing rigging is steel wire. Standing rigging was minimal on rams, to enable deck cargo to be stowed on uncluttered decks.\n\nShe was designed to carry general cargo in the Chesapeake Bay. She was built with a centerboard, and a shallow draft for work in the Bay. Her centerboard, replaced in 1965, \"draws 7 feet 6 inches with the centerboard up and 18 feet with the centerboard down.\"\n\nSailing career \nEdwin and Maude served in the cargo trade until 1945 carrying \"sawn lumber, grain, soft coal and fertilizer.\" She was converted to carry passengers in 1946.\n\nShe was renamed Victory Chimes after purchase by a syndicate in 1954, for charter in Maine. In 1984, the ship was purchased by a Minnesota banker, Jerry Jubie, \"for about $1 million\", who brought her to Duluth, Minnesota. She was used for educational cruises for high school students, sold at auction in 1987, and sold again by Norwest Bank in 1988 to Thomas Monaghan, the owner of Domino's Pizza. Monaghan renamed her Domino Effect. He used the vessel for employee incentive cruises, and invested a considerable amount of money in restoring her with traditional methods at Sample's Shipyard in Boothbay Harbor. The ship returned to Maine in 1989, where she was purchased by Captain Kip Files and Captain Paul DeGaeta in 1990 for the passenger trade. They changed her name back to Victory Chimes. In 1997, it was reported that the vessel was operating as a traditional sailing ship, without an engine on board.\n\nJust as when Victory Chimes was built, the schooner does not carry an engine. Maneuvering assistance is provided by a nineteen foot wooden yawlboat which pushes against the stern. When not in use it is towed astern. The current yawl boat was built in 1991 ... to enable the vessel to compete with other vessels in the passenger schooner trade which have been modified to carry engines. The yawlboat is ...\"probably a bit bigger than would have originally been used.\" It is powered by a 135 horsepower Ford diesel engine. Three other boats are carried on davits.\n\nAs of 2010, Victory Chimes yawl boat Enoch was equipped with a 210 HP Cummins diesel engine. The donkey engine which retrieves the anchors and can be used to raise sail is a 6\u00a0hp single cylinder Seeger manufactured by Olds and installed in 1904.\n\nNational Historic Landmark \nThe vessel was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996 and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1997.\n\nSee also\n List of schooners\n List of National Historic Landmarks in Maine\n National Register of Historic Places listings in Knox County, Maine\n List of oldest surviving ships\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n\nPress coverage of Victory Chimes\n\nNational Historic Landmarks in Maine\nShips on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine\nRockland, Maine\nTransportation buildings and structures in Knox County, Maine\nSymbols of Maine\nMerchant ships of the United States\nIndividual sailing vessels\nShips built in Delaware\nChesapeake Bay boats\nSchooners of the United States\nTall ships of the United States\nWindjammers\n1900 ships\nHistoric American Engineering Record in Maine\nNational Register of Historic Places in Knox County, Maine", "The index of physics articles is split into multiple pages due to its size.\n\nTo navigate by individual letter use the table of contents below.\n\nB\n\nB-factory\nB-tagging\nB-theory of time\nB.

The municipality was proclaimed as the Borough of Windsor on 4 March 1871 and was centred on the Town of Windsor. In 1949, with the passing of the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948, the council doubled in size with the amalgamation of the Municipality of Richmond to the west. On 1 January 1981, Windsor merged with the Colo Shire Council to the north, forming the Hawkesbury Shire (City of Hawkesbury from 1989).\n\nCouncil history\n\nWindsor District Council\nFirst settled by Europeans in 1794 in a bid to acquire arable land to feed the increasing population of the penal colony at Sydney, Windsor was proclaimed a Town in December 1810 by Governor of New South Wales Lachlan Macquarie, when he established the five Macquarie Towns in the Hawkesbury River area: Castlereagh, Pitt Town, Richmond, Wilberforce and Windsor. Windsor's place on the river, meant that it was an important location for provided the fledgling Colony of New South Wales with half its annual grain requirements. On 24 July 1843, the Windsor District Council was proclaimed by Governor Sir George Gipps, as part of an early attempt to establish local government administration throughout the colony. Established under the Constitution Act 1842, the District Council comprised a Warden, William Cox (son of pioneer William Cox), and seven Councillors, Josiah Allen Betts, Robert Fitzgerald, Francis Beddek, Charles Tompson, Thomas Tebbutt, and Thomas Arndell. \n\nThe first quarterly meeting of the Windsor District Council was held on 12 August 1843 and the Council\u2019s main functions included education, land valuation, and public works (such as road maintenance). This experiment in local government was not very successful, with much public opposition focused on the issue of increased taxation, and a lack of oversight and faulty administration led to the collapse of many of these District Councils. The Windsor District Council had ceased to exist by 1858, when the NSW Parliament passed the Municipalities Act, which allowed for the creation of Municipalities and Boroughs.\n\nBorough and Municipality\nUnder the succeeding Municipalities Act, 1867, which allowed for residents to petition the Colonial Government for incorporation, a petition signed by 242 Windsor residents, amongst a population of 1,902 residents in the 1861 Census, was sent to the Governor in October 1870. The petition was subsequently accepted and on 4 March 1871, the \"Borough of Windsor\" was proclaimed by the Governor The Earl Belmore. \n\nThe first election was held on 1 June 1871 for nine Aldermen. On 7 June Robert Dick was elected the first mayor and John Thomas Smith was appointed the first Council Clerk. The neighbouring Richmond Borough Council to the west followed on 18 June 1872. The first meeting was held at the Windsor Court House, the second in the School of Arts, and afterwards in the Oddfellows' Hall to 1891. \n\nIn 1890 the municipality acquired the 1879 post and telegraph office on George Street at the junction of Christie Street opposite Windsor Public School in exchange for a piece of land that was added to the public school grounds. On 25 January 1891, Council reopened the building as their first Council Chambers and held their first meeting there on 22 April 1891. From 28 December 1906, following the passing of the Local Government Act, 1906, boroughs ceased to be a category of local government and the council was renamed as the \"Municipality of Windsor\". The area was also enlarged to include rural areas.\n\nAfter Council in 1927 voted to reject a proposal to borrow \u00a310,800 for the erection of a new town hall, it was nevertheless recognised that the 1891 Council Chambers were \"dilapidated and a disgrace to the town\". A new Council Chambers on the same site was accepted by Council in 1934, with a tender for \u00a31,182 accepted in April. The old chambers were quickly demolished and the foundation of the Georgian revival Inter-War Free Classical building by architect John Barr (noted for his work on St Andrew's Canberra, and St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne) was officially laid by the Minister for Local Government, Eric Spooner, on 16 June 1934. The new Council Chambers were officially opened by the Member for Hawkesbury (and grandson of former Windsor Mayor, William Walker), Bruce Walker Jr, on 13 October 1934.\n\nLater history\nBy the end of the Second World War, the NSW Government had realised that its ideas of infrastructure expansion could not be effected by the present system of the patchwork of small municipal councils across Sydney and the Minister for Local Government, Joseph Cahill, following the recommendations of the 1945\u201346 Clancy Royal Commission on Local Government Boundaries, passed a bill in 1948 that abolished a significant number of those councils. Under the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948 (effective 1 January 1949), Windsor Municipal Council merged with the Municipality of Richmond, adding the Town of Richmond, to form a reconstituted Windsor municipality.\n\nBy 1966, the 1934 Council Chambers was considered too small for the greatly-enlarged municipality and Council built new Council Chambers and offices further down at 366 George Street, opposite McQuade Park in 1966, which were renovated and extended in 1980-81 to become the Hawkesbury Council Chambers, where the City of Hawkesbury meets today.\n\nWith the passing of the Local Government Areas Amalgamation Act 1980, on 1 January 1981 Windsor Municipal Council merged with the neighbouring Colo Shire to form the Hawkesbury Shire, which became the City of Hawkesbury from 1989.\n\nMayors\n\nReferences\n\nWindsor\nWindsor\nWindsor\nWindsor\nCity of Hawkesbury\nWindsor, New South Wales\nRichmond, New South Wales", "\"The Royal Anthem of Jordan\" () is the national anthem of Jordan, adopted in 1946.

He led a band of irregulars who were known locally as the 'cowboys'.\n\nClaudius was the eldest son of David Smith (1701\u20131787), a respected  tailor, cattleman, miller, constable, clergyman, and finally judge in Brookhaven, New York. His mother was Meriam (Williams) Carle, a daughter of Samuel Williams of Hempstead, New York. David Smith was the son of a Samuel Smith, but the identity of this Samuel is not certain.\n\nClaudius as a guerrilla leader\nDuring the Revolutionary War, Claudius, along with several members of his family, including three of his four sons (William, Richard, and James), allegedly terrorized the New York countryside in an area formerly known as Smith's Clove (presently Monroe), Orange County, New York, where David Smith and his family had moved about 1741 from Brookhaven.\n\nAccounts differ on Claudius Smith's size and stature. A 1762 French and Indian War muster roll lists him as 5'9\". However, a 1778 wanted poster for his arrest claims he stood nearly an unbelievable seven feet tall.\n\nAll accounts agree that Claudius was a Loyalist and took part in Tory raids alongside the Mohawk Indian Chief, Joseph Brant. Claudius was also aided in his anti-Whig activities by Fletcher Mathews, brother of David Mathews, the Loyalist Mayor of New York during the Revolution.\n\nThough he gained a fearsome reputation among the Patriots, Claudius is not actually known to have killed anyone. He was even viewed by some as sort of a Robin Hood, helping to defend the Loyalists in the area. At one point, Smith even ended up in jail with a close relative of Capt John Brown (1728\u20131776), the grandfather of John Brown the abolitionist.\n\nHowever, when one of Smith's men did apparently rob and kill a Patriot leader, Major Nathaniel Strong, on October 6, 1778, New York Governor George Clinton posted a reward of $1,200 for Smith's arrest. Claudius was soon captured and was hanged on January 22, 1779 in the town of Goshen, Orange County, New York. Two of his sons, William and James (the latter captured in February 1779 by an Abner Thorpe ), would suffer the same fate.\n\nRichard Smith remained at large at least through 1781, when his name appears in a letter addressed to Governor Clinton from Gen George Washington warning Clinton that he was the target of a planned kidnapping by the remaining members of the Smith Gang.\n\nClaudius Smith in fiction\n\nRichard Smith is a character in Elizabeth Oakes Smith's 1867 novel Bald Eagle; or, The Last of the Ramapaughs, which portrays Claudius's son as seeking vengeance on the people of Orange County for the killing of his father.\n\nClaudius Smith is a character in E.P. Roe's 1876 novel, Near to Nature's Heart. According to Rev. Roe, moments before the real Smith was hanged, he kicked off his shoes, saying, \"Mother often said I would die like a trooper's horse with my shoes on; but I will make her a liar.\"\n\nAuthor Pam Jackson writes of Claudius Smith's legend in her novel 'Wood, Fire, and Gold' released in 2014.\n\nEndnotes \n\n   He may have been a Samuel Smith Jr. of Barbados, who is conjectured to have a direct relationship with a David Smith of Long Island, New York who married another Elizabeth Lewis in 1703, and many inhabitants of the New York area at this time traveled back and forth between the West Indies and northern coastal areas. Most genealogists, on the other hand, feel as though David was in fact descended somehow from an Arthur Smith, as is partially \"proven\" in the manner in which he originally signed his name: with an \"A\".\n\nReferences\n\nSources\n George Washington Papers at the Library of Congress, 1741-1799, Series 3c Varick Transcripts George Washington to George Clinton, August 10, 1781 (search for \"Claudius Smith\").\n Samuel W.

NDMU is situated between the wealthy residential neighborhoods from the early 20th Century of Homeland and Guilford, just north of the cross-town, Cold Spring Lane, and adjacent to the Evergreen campus of Loyola University Maryland (formerly Loyola College) to the south (occupied since 1922). It borders to the south, the historic landmark Greek Revival styled mansion of the Garrett family.\n\nAdjacent to the Montrose House (1850) on the original property site purchased by the School Sisters of Notre Dame, one of the first buildings, \"Gibbons Hall\", was constructed in an \"L-shaped\" structure. It surmounted by its landmark white wooden tower, and opened in 1873 and became the landmark site symbolizing \"Notre Dame of Maryland,\" which offered instruction to girls and young women. Gibbons Hall was named for the then incumbent Archbishop of Baltimore and second American Cardinal of the Church, James Gibbons.\n\nThe university's Marikle Chapel of the Annunciation was originally designed by notable architects Ephraim Francis Baldwin and Josias Pennington. It was restored in 2002. Fourier Hall is an example of Art Moderne architecture. The renamed \"Noyes Alumnae House\", which was the former Montrose estate of a red brick Greek Revival style of architecture was built in 1850, on the southwest corner of the campus. Several buildings on the campus were designed by architect George Archer\n\nThe university shares a library with the neighboring Loyola University Maryland. The Loyola/Notre Dame Library was built primarily in a valley on land primarily owned by Notre Dame of Maryland and located between the two Roman Catholic campuses, with a road access to the east to York Road (Maryland Route 45) and the Govans community.\n\nSome courses from the College of Adult Undergraduate Studies and College of Graduate Studies are offered at off-site locations, including: Anne Arundel Community College, College of Southern Maryland, Northeast Maryland Higher Education Center, Laurel College Center, and Southern Maryland Higher Education Center.\n\nAcademics\nNearly 3,000 students take courses in degree granting programs:\n NDMU\u2019s Undergraduate offers 29 undergraduate majors along with interdisciplinary minors, certificates and five-year Bachelor of Arts(BA)/Master of Arts and BA/Master of Arts in Teaching programs.\n The Undergraduate Studies features special and competitive programs such as the Morrissy Honors Program and Trailblazers, a support program for first-generation college students.\n Notre Dame has pre-professional programs, including pre-law, pre-medical and pre-pharmacy.\n The College of Adult Undergraduate Studies offers ten majors and features part-time flexible and accelerated schedules for working adults who are pursuing bachelor's degrees.\n The College of Graduate Studies provides coeducational weekend and evening classes in education, management, contemporary communication and nonprofit management, a Ph.D. in Instructional Leadership for Changing Populations, and a Doctor of Pharmacy.\nThe college offers two noncredit programs:\n The English Language Institute provides instruction in English language and American culture for international students, professionals and visitors to the United States.

A molecular phylogenetic study published in 2013 found that most of the insular subspecies had substantially diverged from one another. The variable dwarf kingfisher was therefore split and 12 of the subspecies, including the Sula dwarf kingfisher, were promoted to species status.

So far only five \u03b2-porphyranases have been identified: PorA and PorB are found in the marine bacteria Zobellia galactinovirans. A wild-type porphyranase activity has been found in Pseudoalteromonas atlantica. BpGH16B and BpGH86A have been found in the human gut bacterium, Bacteroides plebeius, of Japanese individuals.\n\nPorphyran, the major water soluble polysaccharide of Porphyra has a linear structure composed of 4-linked \u03b1-l-galactopyranose-6-sulfate (L6S) residues and 3-linked \u03b2-d-galactopyranose (G) residues. Beta porphyranase (EC 3.2.1 178; 3= Hydrolase; 3.2= Glycosylase; 3.2.1 = Glycosidases (enzymes hydrolyzing O- and S- glycosyl compounds)) acts as a glycosidase to catalyze the following chemical reaction:\n\n Hydrolysis of beta-D-galactopyranose-(1->4)-alpha-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate linkages in porphyran\n\nThe backbone of porphyran consists largely (~70%) of (1->3)-linked beta-D-galactopyranose followed by (1->4)-linked alpha-L-galactopyranose-6-sulfate.\n\nGut microbiome \n\nCAZymes are carbohydrate active enzymes that breakdown dietary polysaccharadies and supply the human body with energy. These are absent in the human genome, but gut microbes are able to perform this process. In Japanese individuals the human gut bacterium, Bacteroides plebius, has \u03b2-porphyranase via horizontal gene transfer. Seaweed is an important component of the diet of Japanese people and the enzyme works to break down nori, the seaweed used in sushi and typically eaten for nutrition purposes. This enzyme has not been found in individuals from the West, and likely won't ever be found in their microbiome, regardless of how much seaweed is incorporated into the diet. \n\nNot only has it been found that seaweed comprises less of the diet in Western cultures, the current treatment of food prevents the possibility of microbes being consumed. Traditionally, nori was not roasted so the associated microbes that led to horizontal gene transfer between the marine microbe on the Porphyra spp. and the gut bacterium would more easily enter the system However, now dietary seaweed is generally free of surface microbes.\n\nStructure \n\nThe most work investigating crystalline structures have been done on PorA and PorB of Zobellia galactinovirans. The L6S unit at subsite \u22122 is surrounded by tryptophan and arginine residues in both PorA and PorB, which construct a positively charged hydrophobic pocket that allows for a bulky sulfate group to fit.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links \n \n\nEC 3.2.1", "Morris \"Buzz\" Zelditch (February 29, 1928 \u2013 December 8, 2017) was an American sociologist.
